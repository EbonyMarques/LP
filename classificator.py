Freddy isnt only game shatteringly broken he completely drains all the fun out of the game absolutely refuse to play any survivor until they actually do something about Freddy.

Overpowered killers and a toxic community Bugs and Hosts with always 250+ Ping make the game 'exhausting'. 9 months ago i would\'ve upvote it.. But the way it is right now rather not. Grab it if it\'s in sale because i think the standard pricing for the game itself &amp DLCs is way too high. GIve it a try and make yourself a picture of it."],

There is an ocean of bugs like texture ones map bugs design bugs and a long etc.... but nah it\'s better to let the players 'swim' in those and instead of fixing them the devs penetrate their dirty d.i.c.k.s in your a.s.s."],

As a survivor the game's atmosphere is absolutely fabulous! I haven't played such a thrill game in such a long time that actually gets my heart racing let alone actually making me jump. I would also recommend this game to everybody who loves a thriller and just wants to release some tention as a killer )"],

           [1, "Great game for under $20.00 but there are still a few bugs. Main issue is that there is no option to play with mixed parties.Unless you have 5 people playing in a custom game there's no way to party up with just 1 or 2 friends and search for a game. Your only option is to do a 'Quick Play' at the same time as your friend and hope to get in the same game. Adding a game Lobby before searching for a game would easily fix this."],
           [1, "So I've played 20+ hours of this mostly as the Survivor and I love it! You'll see a few negative reviews because there's no 'Survive With Friends' feature yet but it is coming. As far as the gameplay it's very tense and unpredictable. Also there's no in game chat between survivors. You never know if the survivors you're paired with will help you or leave you to die. I'm having a blast with this. I highly recommend this game! It's amazing now and it will only get better!"],

Being a fan of the horror genre I love being able to stalk and kill 'helpless' victims. Don't even get me started about hanging them up on hooks. It appears that there is no shortage of DLC content too so the game should stay fresh for a while!"],

           [1, "Absolutely amazing game. It still has its bugs and balance issues but that is to be expected from such a relatively new game. I can't wait to see the new features they plan on adding and watching this game take shape.Overall the feel of being in a horror film was perfectly captured! I would rate this game a solid 10/10 for its fun gameplay and great potential. It has worked its way into my favorites list."],
           [1, "Alright I love this game and i wont lie... This is my favorite game on steam and it has ever sence i bought it. I say you should buy this. I mean i havnt got bored of it yet and ive been playing for about a year now. Like suriously I love this game so much I still dont know how this game doesnt have more players. It really should have more players also thank the people who made this really really fun game. I think they made a great job of this game."],
           [1, "An amazing game. Especially when everyone is all in. The best is when you're paired up with a truly terrifying killer. Most of the time there is little to no lag. But occasionally there are issues. It is also friendly to a wide range of computers. I can run it on a relatively slow computer and I have friends who can run it on even slower systems."],
           [1, "At first I found this game to be really repetitive and thought I was going to regret my purchase. After a while however I realized that this game kept getting me to come back to it as the matches are addicting. There are several different killers and maps making each scenario slightly different. Depending on the skill of the other players the game can be very challenging or easy. Anyways it s a lot of fun!"],
           [1, "Can you imagine as awsome as it would be if we could see other player's expressions on the coner of the screen while playing as the killer!? The look one one's face as you chase down one player and the closer you get the more intense things get. Although it could probably serve as a distraction... I give this game a 9 out 10! Excellent game with big potential for more."],
           [1, "Dead By Daylight can be extremely fun and challenging. The idea of the game is a good idea and hopefully the devs can improve the game further.I recommend this game because it can at times become addicting to play. If you ignore the stupid glitches and bugs it is really enjoyable. However with friends it's a even more enjoyable. )"],
           [1, "Dead by Daylight has always been my favourite game to play there's always constant updates on the game to improve the game. For example the revamp of the blood web to have have lesser nodes and the choice within 2 perks instead of one. Really helpful update! The idea for survivors to have infinite health when being hooked the first time to encourage killer not to camp you is also a really good idea. I love Dead by Daylight hahaha"],
           [1, "Dead by Daylight is an honestly great idea and a game it emphaisizes teamwork and the thing about matchmaking is that the surivors are woefully overpowered in later levels hence why no one plays killer and usually camps as killer. But that's besides the point I personally love playing killer against randos it's quite fun being called a camper when all i do is rotate. 10/10 would hook again."],
           [1, "Dead by daylight is an interesting game with a unique playstyle. I have invested a couple of hours into this game so far and have enjoyed my experience both as a survivor and as a killer. However that said If you are looking to play this game with your friends then expect to be waiting awhile whilst the solo match making queue seems to work flawlessly queuing with friends does not and can really ruin the experience if you want to play with friends."],
           [1, "Dead by daylight will make your heart beat and you will feel the tension when sneaking around or getting chased by a raving psycopath! A must have for everyone who like horror! Plus you can play it with your friends. You can get hooked together and get camped but that's just another story..."],
           [1, "Fun game in general not as buggy as it used to be and chasing around survivors is something I can easily do for hours. Game feels pretty complete with the dlc out have only encountered one major bug since the patch and that's in about 10 hours of play. A game well worth playing especially if you have 3 4 friends to survive with or hunt down."],
           [1, "Good asymmetrical survival horror game that provides tensity while maintaining a sense of purpose for survivors. It suffers from a hefty dose of grind fatigue however as it takes hundreds of hours to create a good perk build for both survivors and killers.As a whole i would rate the game a 7/10 as of now."],
           [1, "Good game better if you play with friends for communication. The only problem is that me and my friends sometimes search a lobby for a long time before we can start a game and then we have a camper killer... But overall it's fun enough to make me recommend it"],
           [1, "Great game especially now since you can Match up with friends. The game still has a few bugs to work out but the DEV are excellent at responding to the community. They listen to the users and continue to update the game to make it more polished. Highly recommend!"],
           [1, "Hello there!I really like playing it! DBD is much fun and its best playing with friends. Im getting super annoyed by all the bugs and unbalanced Killer Survior Perks (My opinion). If u wanna have all DLC's it costs a lot of money but they aren necessary so thats fine with me."],
           [1, "Honestly I won't lie this game does have some problems that need to be worked on like matchmaking some bugs etc. But I def would recommend this game to anyone. If you play with friends it makes the game so much funner. I love the whole idea of the game and the concept."],
           [1, "I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME CAUSE THERE ARE SOME KILLERS WILL FOLLOW YOU NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IN WHICH YOU'LL GO LOOPING EACH OTHER Who said this game is a horror game but MEHHHH Lieesssss ahhahahaha xDDDI never laugh so hard cause of this game I LOVE IT &lt 3333"],

           [1, "I would recommend this game specially if you get it on sale. The game itself is fairly simple and easy to understand but hard to master. It pitches 4 survivors against 1 killer in a randomly picked map. Survivors try to escape and the killer does what a killer does. Pros Ability to outplay other people is fun and encouraging.Many hours of play for relative little moneyUpdated regularly.Cons Lack of a proper Ranking systemSlightly lacking polish on non gamebreaking issues."],
           [1, "The start of the game can be a bit challenging for new players and progression is pretty slow until you've put a decent chunk of time into the game. Lag is pretty common and can ruin games. Players with a lot of time invested can be pretty toxic.Even with these problems it's still a fun game. The learning curve is steep but once you've gotten the hang of it it's a lot of fun.Playing with friends highly recommended especially for newer people"],
           [1, "The game is good but after 100 hours of play you understand that in it as in any other community game is not so ordinary (toxic). Comterative is not interesting as they usually all go to the discord and break the gameplay for this they are camped and then in the chat we see complaints about maniacs. But the game takes the atmosphere and I hope that the game will be engaged in the right direction"],
           [1, "A really fun game that requires a lot of teamwork.Obviously a lot more fun to play with your friends but also great to play by yourself to try and get better at the game.Some things need more work though like the lobbies being P2P and you being dependant on the internet connection of the killer. Also the anti cheat system needs some more.Great game to play try and get it while on sale"],
           [1, "Has had it's ups and downs for me but when you starting playing absolutely EVERY noise scares you and it's a really cool experience even more so with friends! You get to introduce people to the game and let them be the scared ones and you can all laugh and have a great time. Even when you've played for a long time you will still get the jump scares and that rush when you're being chased. I love it"],

           [1, "It may be never bug free but the devs are always working on them. Its the best horror game currently available and features some well known characters from horror movies.

They face so much crap from the very community that both praise and despise the game try their hardest to get things right and appease the community it's hard not to love them. The game itself always has enough draw to keep me coming back especially when friends are playing"],
           [1, "i love this game. in most horror games it's singleplayer and even when there is multiplayer in a horror game it's mostly only coop and the killer is just an AI but in this game you can be the killer or the survivor if ur survivor someone else is the killer so you have to play against real people i would really recomend this game if you like horror games it definetly is worth the money(or you buy it on a sale like i did"],
           [1, "This game is addictive. With headphones you become fully immersed for a night of jump scares.

Community lacks a little bit do bump into some of them kids who think they're amazing but miss the ball 24/7 im diamond 3 to champ rotating between them ranks and i can say i still love this game! As you can see by my hours it took a while to get there so dont let your self down practice makes perfect! you're all thank you &lt 3"],
           [1, "This game is absolutely awesome!. I love this game and it never gets old just like my other games.First i was like whaaaa??!! Then after some time i was really enjoying myself. Not only you can play online you can do many tricks and skills and do custom matches Much more too!"],
           [1, "Rocket League is a awesome Game.The graphics are quite wonderful you can customize your car A LOT and every Game is different.It is of of those Games which are really easy to learn but really hard to master.Another awesome Thing about this Game is that you have a really recognizable Learning Curve and that you are proud of yourself each time you finally manage to do something that you trained hours and hours for.btw sorry for all kinds of grammar mistakes i'm german."],
           [1, "Definetly worth $12. Very fast paced game. There isn't a learning curve which is nice but it will take a while to get everything down. It's a very exciting game. I always go crazy when I make an insane save or crazy pass. If you want a fast paced competetive game this is it. BTW I play this by myself and its still extremely fun."],
           [1, "I really enjoy Rocket League. It is the perfect embodyment of easy to play hard to master. It is brilliant for having friends over and playing even if your friends aren't gamers however if you play for a while you can find yourself doing crazy aerial maneuvers and scoring insane goals. Definetely a good game to get!"],
           [1, "I always tought what fun could it be to play a car footbal game over and over again well 150 hours later I can honestly say its fun! It's easy to play hard to master which makes it quite fun to play. It's really a challange to be really good at this game. Would reccomend."],
           [1, "This game is way too addicting for one's own good. Last night I played for 7 straight hours and 123.4 hours in 3 weeks. this is insane. I just say 'one more match' and it turns into three hours! it's insane! I have to turn down my video settings but it runs well and plays great"],
           [1, "This game is amazing! All you have to do is put in some time. Dont expect to be good until atleast 50 hours played. Every single rank you progress in is a COMPLETELY. DIFFERENT. GAME. it gets more fun the higher you get! D would reccomend this to anyone of all ages )"],
           [1, "I've bought this game out of curiosity with the humble bundle (about 1 month ago). I've been playing this game ever since. It is just awesome the developers give so much and even the stuff you can buy is reasonable. It makes a lot of fun especially with friends. And the cars are well balanced i don't feel like there is anything unfair in this game.10/10 best game bought in years."],
           [1, "Played this game for a long time.It's honestly really good. The new rocket pass allows players to get decryptors and open crates for basically playing the game.It's a really good game it's not pay to win because the best car is the Octane which you get for free.You can buy things to make your car look good. But it doesn't help in game.Overall really good game. You sometimes run into toxic people but you can toggle chat off. Yeah.Overall my favorite game."],
           [1, "Awesome game! This is by far one of the best games of the Century. I've played a lot of SP mode and recently started online but I can tell you that both are great. Love all the variable and exciting missions aswell as the free play on the huge map. I've got a PC with good graphics and CPU which makes the gameplay very smooth and real! 5 of 5 stars!"],
           [1, "First and the best game I bought... have totally no regret buying this. I am suprised that rockstar still continue to update and add new content and mission modes into GTAV without haveing us to pay for them as 'DLC' just buy the game and u are good to go."],
           [1, "Singleplayer is realy cool.You can add awesome mods to it.Story is cool. Online kicks br&gt Fun to play with friends.Awesome online races.Missions with money rewards.Weapon unlocks.Becoming a VIP CEO and a MC President.Buying houses. Game is awesomeGraphics can be realy realy good.You need a good PC.+Worst PartIn Online there are modders.They can get your money and add to theirs.Steal your weapons and other stuff.There are less of them/*IMPORTANTDO NOT ING BE A MODDER IN ONLINEor I will kill ya"],
           [1, "Its one of my favourite game i would definately recommend it. Advantage Great GraphicsFun to playDecent StoryGreat Charactersthe Overall its a good game"],
           [1, "This game is probably my favorite game ever. The single player is a long well written and fun campaign with some awesome moments. The multiplayer while there are many hackers is also incredibly fun if you have friends to play with. The multiplayer heists are well designed and have immense replayability. My only complaint with the multiplayer is that many cars and outfits are fairly expensive. Overall I would rate this game a 9.5/10."],
           [1, "Product received for free. Its actually very good game. I mean it really does have good graphics but you actually dont need that good pc for it. Every single pc from 2015 2017 should run it smooth.I have only 13 Hours on it just beacouse my procesor. its very bad and i dont have much rambut i still can run it but i can hi min fps of 10.My PC GeForce GT 730 2 GBIntel Core 2 duos E75004 GB RAmI Recommend this game alot. + you can get very cheap on LINK REMOVED or Send me message for more"],
           [1, "Ay sup guys its ya boii noone. So this game is really good recommend it a lot great graphics hostile players (well most of them..) but there are good ones wide selection of weapons masks clothing and heist we cant forget the good old hangar mc vip ceo and bunker bussines they make a lot of money so yea i recommend the game.BUT before i got Rockstar fix the damn servers they always kick players wat is wrong with u fix em for the LOVE OF GOD thx Buh Bye"],
           [1, "One of the best selling games to date and rightly so. Had a bumpy start with playing online and then recently the whole issue with modding the game which both were resolved fairly quickly. Besides those issues it has been a really good experience having played it on the Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC was worth playing through it on all platforms. I can't fault it whatsoever"],
           [1, "I mean... I bought this game twice so I guess that shows how good I think it is. Well if you're into a well developed story with memorable characters and a multiplayer open world game that has endless of content I would definitely recomend this game! However be prepared for some hackers pay to win players and a lot of waiting"],
           [1, "It's really a good game to play at home. You can play with friends you get do mission races and more! You can even play it without WIFI! But you just cant play Online. But you will be occupied in Story Mode! Playing Online is the most fun. You even get to play Rockstar created missions!"],
           [1, "Best game ) Got banned too 18.04 cause i hacked XD i just wanted some money.Plus Very fun its too much things too do ) Most of the players are nice and kind and EVERYONE love to show off their cars.Minus No mod support (. I still got FiveM which YOU should try out its the best online mod for GTAV today.Too many s online.8/10 Have a nice day )"],
           [1, "Game's story is very good and most important part is online version is giving you fun and you can when you can play with your friend you can't get bored you can do lots of things in online version you can fly with planes drive a fantastc cars and you can be piece of action"],
           [1, "Grand theft auto is one of the games that got me into gaming. Loved it since number 1 the story line in GTA 5 is ing awesome. You get to play as 3 different guys and that is all i will say i am not spoiling the story for you new players out there. After you beat the game or even before u beat it... or during u can get online and play with friends !!! D Hell yeah.. battle time heist time.. fun time )"],
           [1, "Really amazing value for this game...PROS * Single player will have you hooked for a good few weeks untill you finish the main story* There is so much more to the game than the main story* The online is free and they release new content all the time!!!!!!! I have never been so happy with a gameCONS * If you want to buy online money for real money it is pretty expensiveCONCLUSION It is a crime not to buy this game when it is on sale for $20"],
           [1, "Everything was perfect. Then one day Rockstar decided to add 'flying cars which are throwing rockets' to the game... WTF? Modders weren't enough i guess. But i still recommend it i mean its a fun game plus there is online mode and friends and Very nice!"],
           [1, "is it a good game ? depends if u're gonna play it offline sure as hell but if u go online NO seriously there are lots of hacker and rockstar doesn't seem to care about it.is it worth the money ? Yes it's a GTA dude if those hackers are gone this will be a damned perfect game"],
           [1, "single player is excellent the replay value is good and its pretty much the game of the generation probablythe multiplayer is slightly more aids due to the sheer number of people who are usually better than you and with you on a hourly basis the multiplayer is very very fun but also very very repetitive unless you are messing around with friends.good game also if you play theres a 90% chance you will become rich in the multiplayer mode cuz all the hackers make it rain money"],
           [1, "Very good game.Single Player is fun complete and never boring now that we have MODS. Probably a good 10/10 from me.But on GTA Online it's kinda mixed. It's pretty boring if you're playing without friends around because you will most likely get bombed by some dude in a jet or get shot at by little in kurumas. But in the rare chance that you have friends everything will be fun from start until you run out of to do.Online just depends if you can handle playing solo or not.IT IS A RECOMMENDATIONBUY"],
           [1, "I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is looking to spend a bit too much money on a game. If you can find atleast one other friend to play this with you will not regret your purchase. From ing with people in a jet or just doing ceo misssions and starting up a business. This game is not as fun if you're alone but don't worry there are alot of s in gta 5 online but i've met quite a few nice people."],
           [1, "One of the best games on console bought it on sale nice community better with friends (oh you dont have any) well thanks for saying that the loading screen is long so boot into singleplayer and then multiplayer and its faster this is an overall amazing game ( 5/29/2017) Hacker gave em 15 trillion dollars GG EZ"],
           [1, "Amazing game bought this before release and downloaded before release. Played the game 2 minutes after release. Cant get enough of it there was a wave of hackers which me off but now R* started banning them so its good. Hopefully they get some sort of anti cheat like VAC or something that bans them instantly."],
           [1, "Definetly one of the best game from this deacade. The Single Player portion of this game is really good. Great story great character great environment all aspect of this game is just top notch quality. The Multiplayer portion of this game is also really addicting and fun. I definetly recommend this game for you to buy"],
           [1, "Probably one of the best games I've played so far! The graphics are amazing! Sometimes I catch myself just driving/flying around Los Santos for hours. This game has an awesome story and such hilarious conversations I should also mention the music which is very good. Rockstar did and amazing job with the city traffic it's very realistic and so is peoples behaviour. If you enjoyed the previous GTA games you are gonna love this one!"],
           [1, "GTA 5 an open world third/first person game. The PC version is a great improvement over the consoles you can finally play it in 1080p 60fps. Great. The story mode is good i'd suggest you play it the Online is much better it's the same Los Santos but with real players. Have fun"],
           [1, "Awesome awesome awesome...oh and did I mention AWESOME!!! I can't only find one fault in this game that annoys me and that's the fact that there is a Casino and you can't use it. Hopefully a future DLC will address that issue but until then the game is just plain fun."]]
