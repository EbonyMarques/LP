1;The game is addictive and fun to play. Licensed characters and constant updates make it even better.The biggest downside is that it has become toxic because of school kids who are bullied at school and who take out their frustrations in the game. There are teams who deliberately demote their ranks to troll low rank killers (2 out of 3 games).
1;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME CAUSE THERE ARE SOME KILLERS WILL FOLLOW YOU NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IN WHICH YOU'LL GO LOOPING EACH OTHER Who said this game is a horror game but MEHHHH Lieesssss ahhahahaha xDDDI never laugh so hard cause of this game I LOVE IT &lt 3333
1;Really like the game prob. one of my favorites. )But instead of working on making new killers and survivers the game developers should maybe consider balancing the difficulty between playing as a surviver/killer since it is really hard to survive where it is much easier just playing as a killer.
1;It's a fun game that I really enjoy. It is not perfect but what game that is still in developement is completely perfect? It just needs some time.But the real problem to me is the players (not everybody tho).They're so horrible they insult each other and I mean survivors AND killers.If you lose get over it it's just a game.
1;so after 700+ hrs of playing this game i still love playing this game. it does have its flaws but after 2 years since it came out the devs still come out with new content survivors/killer plus always a new map to play in so hope they keep coming out with new stuff and i do recomend this game to anyone specially playing with a group of friends
1;Its a pretty awesome game. Its almost like Evolve except the survivors are the ones worrying instead of the killer because they cant fight back. But the game is still a bit buggy like with survivors dying on the hook the entity cant grab their souls or downed survivors cant be picked up by the killer. Still overall its definitely a fun game
1;Ignore all these negative reviews complaining about matchmaking and not having a party system yet the game has not even been out that long. New features and balances will come you just have to be patient. The game is still amazing regardless. Once you get the hang of it you're hooked. )
1;Been sitting here for 30minutes pressing ing ready in this press ready simulator with my friends. they should add a queing system for lobbys but that would take away from the immersiveness of you having to press the ready button 100 times before you actually find a game. 10/10 would press ready again
1;"""Okay..I kinda have mixed feelings about this. And it's not about the gameplay. It's about duo queue. It is way to bugged right now. I hope they fix that. Everytime you don't find a match you have to press """"READY"""" again. And sometimes your party goes to a seperate lobby and you have to invite them again.Other then that I absolutly love this game. I mostly play as survivor since I think it's better played that way.Final Verdict 9/10"""
1;Dear BHVRs On behalf on players on DBD (killer and survivor) here's my thought about the game https //youtu.be/jHjaHygfWHABut despite of all the bugs and glitches that happens I still love this game very much and always be in my heart.GG and WP devs &lt 3
1;Good game better if you play with friends for communication. The only problem is that me and my friends sometimes search a lobby for a long time before we can start a game and then we have a camper killer... But overall it's fun enough to make me recommend it )
1;This is sort of a mixed review. I love this game a lot it's fun with friends and overall I enjoy it. However my internet cut out while I was loading into the game and it reset all of my progress. I tried emailing and tweeting them about the issue and I got no response back.
1;hey guys stonedgoat here faaaaagggsss whats up im here wich a leeegiiiit revieeeww lets get into itfirtsm off i just wanna say whats up?ltell me how ur summers been hopefully u ed allot of spicsss and nogghersok game is trash if no frend so dont buy if ur lonely sav like me
1;We need more server for other country every single game I join is laggy and delay. I cant play. I just keep teleporting or the animation just keep repeat in my screen.But this is a good game. Just need more server and UI friendly and some optimzation for this game
1;I love this game so much but the fact im rank 20 playing killer and i go against ranks 6's and 5's? the matchmatching is awful there are plenty of trolls afks campers toxicity. I love the game and I do reccomend it but the game does need some changes.
1;I am a player of this game since patch 1.0.1. I've been through the ups and downs the game has had. I hate to see this game go down because the devs are not patching some of the bugs that the community has noticed. I really REALLY enjoy this game. And i will hate to see it go down
1;Altough the community is very Toxic with facecamping killers to teabagging survivors I keep coming back to Dead by Daylight to spend my time. With each progress you feel some accomplishment and never feel like your time being wasted. There is a good balance between killers and survivors (sometimes they fk up the balance with a new killer) but that's solved with a quick update most of the time!
1;very fun game I dont know why people diss it soo much for my first couple of hours the game was hard and confusing but once you get the hang of it youre golden stealthing around the killer when they are just feet away from you or nearly missing a skill check that could give you away. This game is better played coop with friends I would'nt reccomend solo
1;this game is fun if ur with a good friends however it mostly dies out at around 50hours playtime. i know people who've been playing it religiously but personally i find the game to slowly get boring as u get used to the atmosphere and you arent as scared as before. also there are quite a few balance issues matchmaking issues boosters ruining fun for others.id recommend it for a few days weeks of fun but better not buy unless theres a sale too many issues to make it worth at full price.
1;This game is really fun but playing with friends is horrible you need to press ready for like a 1000 times before you join a lobby and half of the time the killer leaves and you need to find a new lobby. but overall I do recommend this game After about 4 5 months the crappy match making has been fixed. but there are still a few problems with the game but the devs say they are working on it.
1;The game is pretty wierd!My friends told me it was great when they played the first time.But after 3 hours they said this Game is Very Boring!!!!You just Fix Machines and GTFO.I Think The reason is The Suvivors Has Been Too Suck!Now You can not Make Fun to The killer and laugh at him.You just Hide!!!But I just Like It I still Hope the Suvivors Rising
1;Dead by Daylight has always been my favourite game to play there's always constant updates on the game to improve the game. For example the revamp of the blood web to have have lesser nodes and the choice within 2 perks instead of one. Really helpful update! The idea for survivors to have infinite health when being hooked the first time to encourage killer not to camp you is also a really good idea. I love Dead by Daylight hahaha
1;Really a nice game. Original dark atmosphere fear and tension.Killer and Survivor can increase his powers just some matcihng problems (playing against characters with level more higher than you... really it's not easy) but you can see the current level of players in the lobby and you can leave for change it.Be a Killer is funny like to be the Survivor.
1;I do recommend this game but a little heads up. Its a huge grind fest. You will get trolled by killers and survivors And if you think getting a better rank will stop you from being tunneled and facecamped your wrong. lvls 15 to 10 is the more trolly killers they are on that brink where they still think rank matters and are super try hard. But all in all there is just too much fun in this game
1;Join lobby.I'm level 1.A guy next to me is level 20.He asks me to leave.I ignore him.He says he does not want to play with noob.I ignore him.Another level 20 joins.The first one keeps asking me to leave.I ignore him.10 minutes into the game.5 engines repaired.Only me and the first guy alive.I open the exitHe gets caught.He cries.He struggles.He wants to live.He looks at me....I ignore him.I escape.10/10 would sacrifice again.
1;This game is a great hide and seek game but has a few problems with no friend queues and somtimes its hard to get into a lobby when the game cannot find a match but i hope a lot of the problems can be fixed and could make an immersive survival horror game.p.s windows in the ironworks of misery+survivor killer getting mugged off a lot
1;The game currently is unplayable due to people leaving or dcing out of a session thus ruining the game for the killer. Who is the host and the only player that matters for making it fun for others. Its a mess but extremely fun at the beginning of the game when you just start out.EDIT I changed my review since the update. Now killers and survivors are balanced and you are no longer punished if people leave the match.
1;Great game thrilling and you get to scare the crap out of survivors when you play as the killer. What's not to like? Oh right the rank obessed players who would disconnect the moment they get hanged so they could preserve their pips (or whatever). If some kind of penalty was implemented towards curbing such force disconnects that would be great. Pretty much the only gripe I have about this otherwise entertaining game with decent potential. 5/7
1;"""""""I hope you die ing """"""""I hope your familiy dies of cancer and aids"""""""" ing kill yourself""""Those are all the words of this game's nice players and also the only downside I can see to this game. If the community weren't as toxic as it is then this game would be so much better.Also not a single hacker I have reported so far has been banned yet wtf get your together."""
1;Titles DBD has claimed.Awarded number 1 game for reinacting lobby simulator 2017 18Awarded best game for balance 2016Awarded best dev interaction 2016Awarded Top 10 'Best ranking system' 2018Awarded cleverist bans given to playersOnly a fraction of awards that DBD has acheived. Here's hoping they obtain more!
1;I say we need a killer perk named 'Camper magnet' that can attract all survivors to the killer after one survivor has been hooked and the killer camps him. That way all killers can be finally happy and they can finally have 4+ kills per match. Then all the mean and petty survivors can suck it and learn to git gud nub.That being said the game is fun but some players are toxic as hell.
1;This game is a fun horror survival game. It is currently under a rough time with the glitches and bugs that it is experiencing. If you can look past that though it is a fun game and does have redeeming qualities enough so that I would recommend it to other people.
1;I'm a huge Horror movie fan and just recently bought the game. This game definitely gets your blood pumping and does not disappoint! You definitely need to get your reaction time down for the QTE's to help get the generators up and running. Did you have a hard day at work??? No worries! Just log in as a Killer and take it out on some survivors. Stress Therapy...Check! But seriously it is a very fun game!
1;This game is definetly a fun one to play with but could still use a bit of improvement. There is quite a bit of lag and the match ups can be really bad when new players get paired up against/with level 20+ players. If some of these things are fixed as well as a few other bugs this game has huge potential. Plus who doesn't like hunting and killing their friends?
1;I highly recommend playing this game to any sci fi thriller or horror game/movie addict. AFAIK it's the best Co Op horror game on Steam and it's worth every penny. It's still in it's early phases of development and considering that it's freakin' amazing. THUMBS UP!
1;So far the game itself has been good and the leveling system is pretty good. The only con I have is the lobby system as sometimes it can take 5 10minutes trying to start a game. This is due to Survivors trying to play with friends which is fair enough but it does need a decent lobby system. Overall still worth $20
1;Firstly This Game Should Be Called Dead By Loading! Because By The Time You Get A Game You Age 30 Years!Secondly They Should Have Dedicated Servers Would Get Rid Of Most The Problems!Also When You Are In A Friends Lobby You Keep Getting Cannot Start With 0 Killers Well Obviously Not As We Are A Lobby Of Surviviours!Apart From Them Few Teething Problems Its Really Is A Good Game When You Finally Get One That Is!Sort It Out Please!!!!
1;At first I found this game to be really repetitive and thought I was going to regret my purchase. After a while however I realized that this game kept getting me to come back to it as the matches are addicting. There are several different killers and maps making each scenario slightly different. Depending on the skill of the other players the game can be very challenging or easy. Anyways it s a lot of fun!
1;Dead by daylight is a 4v1 online game with competitive mode Ok guys this is probably my favorite game I ever played l came here because when l play outlast l was thinking how can be outlast online thats basically this game Very fun with friends and withouth A lot of killers and survivors... there is Bill from L4D29/10 bcause has a toxic community and a not a lot but there are bugs
1;Great game Really fun to play by yourself or with friends. There are some awesome moments when you sucsessfuly juke the killer or he walks right past you without seeing you as well as the satifing feeling as killing everyone or maybe I'm just a psycopath.
1;I have played this game for a long time and felt it was time a made a review. Acording to the fact I say i have played it for a long time that probably shows that I have a positive review this game is great. I love how they are always trying to even out the killer and the survivors ability. They are always making it better and better and adding new content.Great. Game.
1;The game is buggy and there are obvious problems however I can excuse that for now because it is fairly new. The devs seem to be interested in improving the game in a timely manner. The game it self is fun. Personally I find more enteretainment in being a killer and hunting down the survivors. However the flip side is also good times especially if you have a group of friends to play with. I give DbD a 7 out of 10.
1;1)Select play as a killer2)Wait 30 mins to find a match with 4 survivors full of legacy and flashlights3)Get 4/4 kills4)All the survivors start spamming your profile with rep camper noob tuneler don't respect 360's5)EnjoyEven if this game is actually trash i love it.Pretty good job so far.
1;"""Even after almost 200 hours of playing and getting """"good"""" at this game you'll still get mori'd three times in a row and depip because killers are s.If you're looking for a competetive game it's not this one. If you're looking for a fun experience with friends look no further.I rate this game a 3 my current record for being mori'd in a row."""
1;after 600 hours i have to say this is a pretty solid minecraft out of five nights at freddy'sits got its bugs but its still really fun. best played with friendspro super fun with friendsevery match is differentmany oc but also killers like michael myers or freddy kruegercon has some bugs
1;Dead by daylight is an interesting game with a unique playstyle. I have invested a couple of hours into this game so far and have enjoyed my experience both as a survivor and as a killer. However that said If you are looking to play this game with your friends then expect to be waiting awhile whilst the solo match making queue seems to work flawlessly queuing with friends does not and can really ruin the experience if you want to play with friends.
1;OK so I've had this game for awhile but was so obsessed with chasing down survivors I forgot to leave a review. Sorry guys. Well I love this game and feel the devs are insanely ontop of the patchs and do a damn good job of balancing and adding new content like the upcoming Halloween Chapter(Chapters new killer new survivor new map XD). Honestly the game is ridiculously cheap for how fun the game is.Hope to hang u around soon.
1;Recently got back into this game after hearing about the leveling system wich is great and that people just starts bombing this game with negative reviews is just showing people thinking about buying this game how toxic people can get when they're giving the right to free speech.i mean the game have had its up's and down's but is getting better gameplay wise but the community is just going to hell.
1;I highly recommend this game for those who want to play a third party game with friends and want to have fun by running from the killer and repairing generators.That tension when you're the last and you only have one door open and the killer is camping it it's amazing.It's worth the money only on sale though
1;I really enjoy this game. I do wish they would add different maps instead of adding different things in the map. I expected more maps for the game before beta but it was the same map just with some extra new features in it. The game is solid. It gets your blood pumping and you actually feel that rush while playing the game. If you're into horror games or movies this game is for you. But again MORE MAPS! D
1;I love this game theres just a couple problems that I would like for the devs to do.Main thing is Bugs. The Devs just keep making DLC and with the recent adition of Leatherface I was a bit cause there doing nothing about the bugs. The opitimazion in this game is horrendus and even with the best PC's they still cant run this game perfectly. If they fix these problems the game would be perfect.(Now I have had a lot more time with the game these reasons are still accurate.
1;If you look past the perks system giving long time players advantages when they're matched up against/with new players (which sadly happens a bit too frequently) and the fact that occasionally it takes quite a while to find a match Dead by Daylight is an amazing game. The gameplay (save aforementioned perks system) is very balanced all the killers are fun to play and there's definitely a lot of skill and teamwork required. Definitely a recommend.
1;It is a really fun game. I have accumualted alot of hours on this game. I have almost 1 character to lvl 50 now and almost none of my survivors are below lvl 10. So I can say that this game is really fun. Has alot of replay value. Just I hate campers and I wish there was something to prevent camping like that.
1;This game is fantastic and definately worth it's price. Espcially since it'll be on sale til July 4th. This being said the only complaint I have about this game is that if you bought the Deluxe Edition you don't get the sound track like it says you will. #Wraithisn'top
1;Satisfying to play killer if you are smart. I love to play killer (rank 1) by the way. I really like to smack those tains with my big sharp weapon who are touching my precious gennies. They will die slow as I hang them like dry jerky letting the blood drip while the Entity will slowly but surely swallow their souls and purge their bodies into the depths of hell. Overall I like smacking them. D
1;Hello there!I really like playing it! DBD is much fun and its best playing with friends. Im getting super annoyed by all the bugs and unbalanced Killer Survior Perks (My opinion). If u wanna have all DLC's it costs a lot of money but they aren necessary so thats fine with me.
1;Fun but the matchmaking is bad. prestiged players shouldnt be with noob killlers. Freddy and The Doctor are hard to play against at my level. Im great at skill checks and sneaking but juking and bullying not so muchThe huntress shoudnt have her movement speed slower thatn the base killer speed.I love the knowledge that somebody is gonna die next time their hooked.
1;I recommend it highly. The developers are working on this game all the time trying to make it fair for killers and survivors. It is really fun D Things change all the time to keep the game fresh. New characters often. Keep up the good work devs. The people that whine are just pansies to be honest.
1;you got them there killerwhatnots swinging their sharp doodads on the other hand you play as one of those survivin bois running around shoving your hand in moving parts that somehow makes a generator run. all in all i rate this game 3 spicy bacon cheese bois and one sharp man high five.
1;Dead By Daylight can be extremely fun and challenging. The idea of the game is a good idea and hopefully the devs can improve the game further.I recommend this game because it can at times become addicting to play. If you ignore the stupid glitches and bugs it is really enjoyable. However with friends it's a even more enjoyable. )
1;I've officially logged 100 hours into this game and I can't get enough of it. Usually I hate horror games but this one is so interesting and exciting that I'm always looking for new techniques to outsmart the other player(s). Would definitely recommend this game to all of my friends.
1;Played this game in beta which i feel was a great decision for the developers. Thought it was a terrific game the suspense is the best and the first time you hear that heartbeat getting closer is enough to drop you dead. Beta got me hooked and definately a highly reccomendable game.Edited for grammar still an awesome game.Edit again Thanksgiving 2018 Still a great game the updates i feel balanced the game a bit out but the community is filled with s so rip.
1;Had to brake the game...it's still fun if you start playing now and don't know abput the old versions (or as i call them the real Dead by daylight)new killer is a doctor and it's hard to win against himso you need to learn how to play on YT fixes happen i'm the best minor things bother but i'm sure other stuff will distract and be even worse in the next update
1;I like to play Wraith when I'm depressed. If I'm ringing my bell repeatedly and just hitting random objects feel free to farm boldness points off me or what not. I'm sure we can all use a breather and if virtual currency will make you happy that's good for me.Please practice teamwork survivors.Please avoid hook camping killers.Wraith and Claudette are my babies and I will cherish them forever.You have a wonderful day if you're reading this.
1;Product received for free. Well if you already know what this game is about and you are here to ask if it's worth it then YES it's 100% worth it if this is the type of game that you would like. It is quite populated it is great fun.If you don't know what kind of game is this imagine a monster game like a bloody version of Skooby Doo or a Redneck version of the Alien movie.For this price it is absolutely worth it and it has enough fun for hundreds of hours in here.
1;The game is super fun and I personally find it addicting. Some games you get chill killers that let you relax for a bit but some games the killer is right on you so there is a lot of change of pace between games. Just saying though the game is 20 times more fun with friends!
1;its fun when you know how to play and ur not facing a killer who is a and face camps or a killer who is an absolute god at killer.As survivor it takes time killer ez but suvivor is ok Killer ez put some time im not that good anymore but was rank 8 kiiller and higher but was fun as killer just need to find the right one.
1;one of the best game i have played everi laugh when i see negative review givebad comment but play dbd 20++ hours.well u know this game is just release so little bug it's not a problem.pros stress release. nice soundtrack sfx. unique gameplay. many map char. instant heart attack. good skill system. psychopath mickey mouse tutorial. sex dungeon.cons no party rankmatch(dev announce party rankmatch system will be implement soon n keybind). no hard pinalty. rare bug. f**king heart attack.
1;Not quite as terrifying as being subjected to russian experiments but is tons of fun to play with my friends Steve Natasha and Sam. Not the best in terms of balance but definitely a fun way to relax after a tough day at work. Frequent updates keep the game fun for a long time I would know about things that have been around forever. Can be frustrating at times and the other players can be hit or miss. Definitely worth picking up.
1;It's a fun game i play a ton of it but as a killer it sucks.I just started out trying to play killer and im a level 2 keep getting matched with level 50 rank 1 surviors .... this needs to be fixed its not fun when you vs high level players as a low level killer. It's impossible to win.
1;I absolutely love this game!!!! From dying on the hooks to hunting your prey down and hanging them up to dry Dead by Daylight has a great atmosphere thaat has intense moments that make your blood rush!!! Worth every penny I paid even the DLC's are nice even though you have to pay extra you do not need them to play and enjoy this wonderful experience.
1;Game Is Fun And Addicting But The Fact Of The Matter Is That Survival Is Op And Needs To Be Nerfed All You Have To Do Is Go Back And Forth Over A Cover And The Killer Cant Catch You And After Like 167 Times He Will Just Leave So Enjoy The Fact That This Games Needs Some Fixing For Sure Other Then That Great Game
1;"""This game is really fun though it's almost impossible to play a killer match without getting called a tunneler and getting comment's on your profile like """"such a tunneler kys"""" without u even tunneling anyone. I guess it is that way because loads of people in this community are pretty toxic from time to time. """"No sh*t FP"""" But really why do I care I'm a suvivor main )"""
1;This is a very fun game that offers two completely different dynamics to place with killer/survivor. It can be very fun to play with friends. There are some development issues just like any game. The community can be very cool and positive but there is a very toxic side to this community. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone especially if you appreciate horror type games.
1;A Fun game that can be played competitively or for $hits and giggles.Sometimes you are hyperactive dodging hits hitting your pallets and skillchecks and the next day when you run into the killer around the corner you might jump out of your seat.Can recommend especially if in sale for $10!
1;When I first started playing this game it was like most said...frustrating at most times. The changes that I've seen being made over the time I've played have been very good. The reponse from the devs and their streams every week show that they really care about the players. The player base however is full of salt. Both on Killer and Survival side. Only con I have is the DLC for the Clown is kinda meh I think they could have gone with better dynamics. The killer model is great looking though.
1;Great game has potential to become even bigger. The only things that should be fixed in future is the searchsystem for games with a friend clicking every 10 sec ready is really annoying I mean just let him search for a game until it finds one even if it takes several minutes. And of course own servers would be awesome lettig people host on the local maschine is not that good.All in all a really great game i deffinitly recommend it.
1;"""Very good game if you are interested in """"horror"""" survival games this is for you. Matchmaking sometimes sucks but it is pleasure to play some games and have fun. I am playing this game also on Xbox so I couldn t forget to buy it on PC )I recommend this game. BOi"""
1;This game is so fun I love it I definitely reccomened it if you like a challenge if you dont mind waiting a bit to get into a game of course that is my only problem is playing with friends because its so difficult to get in a game with them besides kill your friends. But overal I give it a 9.5 out of 10 because I just love this game to death.
1;most fun game i've played so far now that they have fixed survive with friends the game is one of the best games to play with friends and by yourself if your deciding to get this game or not i would highly recommend it only one thing the devs need to look at. the balance of perks on both killer and survivor some are a must have and some are a throw away other than that my favourite game
1;Product received for free. Searching for a match &gt No matches foundSearching for a match &gt No matches foundSearching for a match &gt No matches foundSearching for a match &gt Finds a lobbyIT WAS JUST A PRANK BRO! Back to seaching.its worth waiting tho ) Good game
1;"""As a killer you have so much fun. You get the chainsaw (wow!) and you also get a beautiful bell which I might add scares the crap out of my guy friends who are meant to be """"brave"""". As a survivor the game's atmosphere is absolutely fabulous! I haven't played such a thrill game in such a long time that actually gets my heart racing let alone actually making me jump. I would also recommend this game to everybody who loves a thriller and just wants to release some tention as a killer )"""
1;"""Dead by Daylight is probably the only horror game that works with coop. Although there has been games made previously that are similar to dead by daylight but lack the horror/action effect that dead by daylight has to offer. However the game is loaded with bugs and deteriorates the """"scary"""" effect but the experience still overwhelmingly worth to buy. Or maybe i'm only writing this review because i'm addicted. 6/10 Graphics9/10 Gameplay10/10 Bugs10/10 Glitches10/10 Exploits10/10 Infinites"""
1;One of my favorite games. I started out as a killer (because being a survivor was too scary) but now I've evolved into a survivor as well. Don't take the negative reviews too seriously most of them are from extremely competitive players who are constantly upset over minor rebalances in the recent patch.
1;"""This game is actually pretty good. I like it quite a lot (not including the games I get camped) 700+ hours and I can play and enjoy it like if I just bought it. 8/10. Would recommend.Below is my favorite quote from one of the devs.""""I think we've done a pretty good job so far"""" Mathieu Cote"""
1;This game is very fun. Had tonnes of fun during the Free Weekend so I decided to buy. However it comes with a few bugs and some uneven matchmaking which may dissuade new comers. But fret not as the developers are very active in pushing out updates and new content which is why it is definitely worth to buy )
1;Hag is broken. She sets traps at the base of hooks and because the clones have collision it's impossible to unhook. Same goes for trapdoor. Also she does not need that many traps. Please limit to 6 or put a 2 minute timer on the 10 traps she currently has and PLEASE get rid of the collision. (Also fix the stun for decisive/wiggling off. It's bull.) Thnx.
1;Two of us left I am injured Using the bond perk notice that the other teammate is hiding in a closet by the hatch Teammate is waiting for me to die so he can escape Spam the enter closet button hoping killer sees Killer knocks me out Killer opens closet and takes guy out Killer hangs guy on hook Guy dies I start spinning in circles on the floor Killer picks me up Killer carries me to hatch I escape10/10 would rat out campers again
1;Where to i being its a very fun game to be honest BUT SERIOUSLY WALL JUMPERS ARE MOSTLY LEVEL 15 AND BELOW I RECOMMED YOU if you playing as a monster just create another lobby dont waste your time on those guys i was playing a match this player he was lvl 9 and he was wall jumping bad and then when he was about to go down in the last hit HE FROZE MY GAME AND HE ESCAPED We need to stop this or the game will die very fast
1;10/10Got chased by a invisible dude who would ring a bell everytime he saw me... Then I steeped on a beartrap got rescued and healed myself by puting a bandage on my arm... After that a random guy chased me with a kitchen knife... And to finish it all i got hanged on a hook.Would play again
1;It's a really good game. Its annoying as you start off because it takes SOOO much practise to git gud at this but after that you cant stop playing. I loved the hide and seek part of the game and even the chases were so much fun. It did get annoying with face camping killers but as I said git gud and you wont have to deal with them (
1;This Game is amazing! The Graphics used in this game is amazing! The only down side of the game is that it is every buggy. The game lags with different servers when playing. But other than that Friends are enjoying it too when playing with them! I cant't wait to see what new updates bring to the game! Me personally only playing 15 hours. I have enjoyed every single minute of the game. I Hightly recommend to new players.
1;I've been playing this game sense it first came out (didnt get a chance to try the beta) and i have loved it. While i am not that good (lets just blame that on the lack of actual time to play) its still a very fun experience..... even when something happens that ticks me off to no end. but thats just how any multiplayer game can go right?
1;Good asymmetrical survival horror game that provides tensity while maintaining a sense of purpose for survivors. It suffers from a hefty dose of grind fatigue however as it takes hundreds of hours to create a good perk build for both survivors and killers.As a whole i would rate the game a 7/10 as of now.
1;I think this is a great game and in the future it can be even greater but a few things that need improvements are the killers not being able to watch the people hang there until they die mainly because its unmoral and just plain not fair secondly I feel as if the game needs more optimizations so the player can enjoy better gameplay. Overall I think this is a great game and I cant wait for it to unleash more killers and maybe even new surivors.
1;Love this game. It has some issues still such as matchmaking but it's getting worked on. Joined a game with a friend.We ran into Hillbilly he hit me with the chainsaw. Then he didnt move and did nothing.Friend Revived/healed me.Probably killer was AFK.Repaired every generator.Then we farmed points at the AFK killer.Suddenly he was alive hit me and my friend made me escape. And hanged my friend.30/20 would farm again P
1;I am fixing a generator while injured I see the wraith coming toward me I hide behind some trees The wraith goes invisible The wraith finds me I begin to run The wraith downs me while it is still invisible I get sacrificed I derank10/10 would get rekt by glitch again
1;Game keeps crashing when for example when i play the hillbilly as soon as i start running my chainsaw it crashes and as a survivor as soon as i try hitting a skill check it crashes. I really like the game but i really dont want to play when i cant even do anything.
1;I love this game and I enjoy so much playing it with my friends.However.Too many bugs crashes and bad players. Some game mechanics are destroyed by perks or offerings reducing fun factor.Matchmaking is another issue. First you will be matched with player of all kind strong e weak. Second many games will not start.
1;i have a lot of fun in this game. the only issue i have with this is the community. console players are toxic. There is not a proper tutorial for the game. in the beginning stages in order to rank up you have to survive for yourself and only yourself because rank 20 players either have the intelligence of a rock or they completely understand the game and will help you without alerting the killer.
1;Well this game is so popular most of you might be seeing this game on youtube and found it fun it is fun but you will find the game so hard at you first 10 20 hours but its just so fun when you get someone in a hook or escape the killer or survive at the end of the game you need a decent PC to run this game idk why but i have lag only when im playing killer.
1;Very good game with great mechanics. I only wish the devs made a bonus if the killer leaves because I hate when you open the exit gates but the killer leaves so you don't get rewarded for escaping. Other than that very balanced and a good 12 PM spook.
1;This game is absolutely amazing to play however it does have one incredibly big problem. If you play with one friend you will almost never get into a game. The que's are incredibly bad for playing with friends which is unfortunate because the game itself is great. When I play with a friend the average wait time finding a match is about 15 minutes which is absolutely rediculous. Please developers fix your que's so we can enjoy your game with our friends!!!!!!
1;Dead by Daylight is an honestly great idea and a game it emphaisizes teamwork and the thing about matchmaking is that the surivors are woefully overpowered in later levels hence why no one plays killer and usually camps as killer. But that's besides the point I personally love playing killer against randos it's quite fun being called a camper when all i do is rotate. 10/10 would hook again.
1;I love this game I have played it for almost 200 hours now and still get great fun out of each and every game. However if I were to change one thing about the game it would be to add more things to do in the game. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game
1;i really enjoy this game really i do. but i do not like how the trapper and the new alien type thing can place traps directly under the person they have on the hook i feel this makes the game extremely unfair there should be a distance requirement for the traps.
1;its good fun however to have the best chance of surviving you need the top tier perks which you need to gring for. you can get by without them on new killers but the odd god will make you play yourself. If you want to play a killer you can mostly wing it the perks aren't too inportant on that side but a decent runner might make you a bit salty.best with friends(but fun solo too)not too buggy( anymore could change)
1;Really fun with friends and solo as well.Bugs need fixes though8/10Give it a try if you like being chased and chasing people. Requires high level thinking end game and survivors are really tricky to catch when they juke really well. 288 hours is pretty good of a indication that it's really fun.
1;&gt Join a game&gt no Matches found&gt join a game&gt wait for 10 seconds on load screen&gt back onto main screen&gt Repeat.Now don't get me wrong I have a blast when I actually get into a game and I'd recommend it. But only as a game to play with mates alone. It's a fun ride a little roleplay adds to this tension in this game. Great scares and playing the killer is a joy!Fix dat matchmaking system though.
1;I love this game so much fauvorite game hands down. but every other week i come up against some sort of problem like daily i get the heartbeat problem. when i launch i also get 2 games and have to go to task manager and take off one of them. sometimes my anticheat is messed up. i feel they need to fix the problems but i really like the game
1;PROS High skill ceiling Intense Not repetitive Altruism and fair play are summonedCONS Matchmaking is currenty unstable. Ranking system is stupid. If the killer disconnects you lose points. 80% of the matches are laggy and you rubberband.I don't know why but i keep playing it.
1;This game is far by one of the most fun multiplayer horror that I have played. It's replay value is very high as well as the shear terror you get everytime the killer approaches you. It's replay value is very high and it's just all laughs while playing with friends. Defintely recommend this game.
1;What I hate about the game is that when we get in the game are prestige are on the line which if the kill leaves the game we lose a survivor ranking which makes me mad I hope you get this message and fix it and yes I recommend this game this game is amazing just has some bugs because it is not fully done yet
1;I really like this game but the way you have to wait for an eternity before you actually get into a game only to find that other players were disconnected (not voluntarily).... You guys really need to fix the matchmaking queue it just takes too much time man.
1;Surprisingly I'm still having fun with this game after 120 hours of playtime great to play with friends and both roles survivor and killer are quite enjoyable. Devs seem to be constantly seeking balance improvements to the game as well fixing killers and perks that seem overpowered or hard to play against.
1;"""What an awesome game!! I was lucky enough to try it for free. I was so impressed by the game that I bought it immediately afterwards! Being a fan of the horror genre I love being able to stalk and kill """"helpless"""" victims. Don't even get me started about hanging them up on hooks. It appears that there is no shortage of DLC content too so the game should stay fresh for a while!"""
1;Dead by daylight will make your heart beat and you will feel the tension when sneaking around or getting chased by a raving psycopath! A must have for everyone who like horror! Plus you can play it with your friends. You can get hooked together and get camped but that's just another story...
1;I've owned this game for some time now. It's a lot of fun. The devs have done a lot of work to try and balance the game between the killer and the survivors not making it too easy or too hard for either side. Sometimes they fall short but the community quickly lets them know when something needs to be changed and 9/10 times they listen. I can't say that this game gives me scares like it used to but almost every game is exhilerating and exciting. Rating 8.5/10
1;Can you imagine as awsome as it would be if we could see other player's expressions on the coner of the screen while playing as the killer!? The look one one's face as you chase down one player and the closer you get the more intense things get. Although it could probably serve as a distraction... I give this game a 9 out 10! Excellent game with big potential for more.
1;"""Great game for under $20.00 but there are still a few bugs.Main issue is that there is no option to play with mixed parties.Unless you have 5 people playing in a custom game there's no way to party up with just 1 or 2 friends and search for a game.Your only option is to do a """"Quick Play"""" at the same time as your friend and hope to get in the same game.Adding a game Lobby before searching for a game would easily fix this."""
1;An amazing game. Especially when everyone is all in. The best is when you're paired up with a truly terrifying killer. Most of the time there is little to no lag. But occasionally there are issues. It is also friendly to a wide range of computers. I can run it on a relatively slow computer and I have friends who can run it on even slower systems.
1;i do not see the big problem with this game seeing the negative reviews i exspected it to suck it did not. it was fun to play and not your usual game load times are an issue and it does glitch in loading sometimes other than that it requires a decent pc or low settings fun game hope the devs are working on it
1;This game is Soooooooo goooood. i played 11 hrs on this game already and not bored of it. Im so glad i got this game. The only thing i dont like is the fact that the killer usally camps people on hooks and waits and then we die. This game is perfect and needs to come out with more characters more customizables and MORE MAPSSSSSSSSSSS. Good job on the game
1;Great game especially now since you can Match up with friends. The game still has a few bugs to work out but the DEV are excellent at responding to the community. They listen to the users and continue to update the game to make it more polished. Highly recommend!
1;Its a really good game the only thing i can think of is a vs ai mode so people dont let their team down if they are new or so new killers can give the survivers a real challenge because if the survivor or killer dosen't know what they are doing you might not get enough points to keep your hard earned rank.
1;This game is just awesome very unique and thrilling. It is as good as you can imagine. Many people are toxic of course but people just tend to be toxic. If you look carefully at those negative reviews you will see they all spent 1000+ hours on this game. So before you start thinking that this game is bad you will have a thousand hours of happy gameplay D
1;Dead by Daylight is a game in which you escape a savage killer by repairing generators. Or you play as the killer yourself and capture people and put them on hooks. The game is pretty solid it just needs a little polishing. The play with friends is a little buggy but other than that this game is amazing
1;This game is for those who wants extra challenge. This is not a battle royale nor killing zombies. You will never understand this game until you learn how to accept every rules and controls. Some killers have no mercy but it depends on the four survivors on how they can survive until the end. Teamwork attentiveness and stealth mode are important here.
1;Product received for free. Amazing game that has been on my wishlist for a very long time. Now that I have it I have to say I love the game. I'm definitely gonna need to practice skill checks more to compensates for my frame rates when they appear. I reccomend this game to all my friends. Its great to play with and without friends with plenty of DLC to keep the game interesting.
1;"""What do you want to feel Adrenalin? Fustration? Happiness? Fear? Despair? Indifference?Play this game and you can feel sometimes a lot feels but if you are sensitive with/about """"bugs"""" don't play that. If you are sensitive with people you can go away from this game game got a active community but s are inside.I can give a 7/10 on my 500 hour of play."""
1;OMFG the killer is so OP. FML. No .. that's kinda the point.I guess but the game crashes all the frikin time! Not for me but I'm not running a potato.Well people just don't play fair. Welcome to life.I hate you. Just ready up and stop crying about a game no one is forcing you to play.
1;WHen i played this game i get many scare moment. For eggsample i walk to fix generalator and it go boom i go fix again and i hear fast heart turn around there a woman with knife try to kill me so I run fast I run everywhere but she alway find me like teleport scotty. So she finally get me and i on ground crawl to bushmans but she still see me. I didnt sleep in like almost entire night but ok. Anyway I like game and would recomend to everyone who brave !!
1;Don't just look at the box Open it look past the frustrations and allow yourself to meet some amazing people then you'll truely know the entertainment this game can bring to you. Chase or be chased.There are many levels to this game can you see them for what they are?
1;Very exciting game. I recommend playing with friends mostly. For the most part the community is very nice and helpful. As with most games like this there may be one or two bad eggs. PThe Developers did a good job with just about every aspect of this game. Going forward a few general fixes to servers are needed and a couple glitches need tending to. Getting into a game is difficult sometimes but with a little patience it is worth it.
1;Very fun game however the matches arent dedicated so you can end up in really laggy games because the killer is always host. Also matchmaking isn't always great because they prioritize filling games quickly ove matching skill level. The game is still a little buggy but I have seen consistent improvement in all of these areas as the game as been updated.
1;This game is one of the most intense game i played in a long time. Right now i have about 65 hour and i still play it. I prefer having some steam friends for this game because playing alone isnt that much fun. I prefer this game because of the intense moments by getting chashed and the scary killers. There are some stupis parts about this game like camping killers and killers who always chase the same guy. 8/10 (sorry for bad english ) )
1;I love Dead by Daylight.This game has its bugs here and there but the dev team I see a dedication close to that of Warframe's team. A group that love their game and are constantly working on it. They listen to their audience and use hard numbers to try and balance things just right.The power trip of beating people to death and the feeling of escaping unscathed on either side of the fence are just great experiences. For such a cheap price it provides a lot of fun.
1;Product received for free. I really enjoy this game really fun and good survivors/killersMaps 8/10Survivors 7/10Perks 9/10Killers 8/10Clothing 6/10For those people who like surviving games this is the game for you.Christmas Update Review New Christmas theme for main menu Wraiths bell has been Changed betterChristmas lights have been added on lockers hooks and barrels.And etcI think we did a pretty good job so far 9/10
1;"""Great Game Lobby with Friends. Play 'who can click ready first' Have great bants whilst it pretends to search for lobby Play 'first to say """"this isn't gonna work""""' Spend hours doing nothingUnfortunately sometimes it takes you into an actual game and you're forced to have fun in a really good and exciting game. Sometimes you may get lucky and the killer will quit just as you get in.10/10 Would ready up again."""
1;Im still a bit new but i have over 150 hours on this game now. I can officially say this is the most amount of t in a game that i have ever played but its very fun. Somehow a hatchet will hit you from across the map you rage quit and then the next you just come back and play again. This game is great but very very infuriating.
1;Is this game perfect? Of course not. Is this game a ton of fun? Absolutely. A large variety of killers survivors and perks to mix and match make this game replayable for hours and hours. After 6 hours it becomes less spooky and more about the mechanics. There are still moments that will scare the out of you but playing with friends and hearing them scream as Michael Myers rounds a corner is priceless.
1;Product received for free. This game has gotten a lot of flak because of its bugs questionable game design choices and generally toxic playerbase but if you're willing to look past some of these this game is really fun and is absolutely at least deserving of a try.
1;Not very deep small in scale and something's always breaking but DBD is a quick and fun horror themed I kinda want to say MOBA that gives two different experiences. Playing survivor is great for an adrenaline boost and grinding out points playing killer is great for ruining a survivor's day. 7.5/10
1;Most people who are crying over the recent killer buffs have only played the game in the last year or don't even play killer at all. These were all needed changes and the game is more accessible to new players and more fun for veteran players then ever before.
1;Fix the killers reach so t how he is far behind me and still can attack me and grab me when im jumping over obstacles or hit me when i turn on a tree and the skill check is not sync correctly. And please fix it so we can have reliable server cause im tired of dieing when the host have bad connection especially when i run into a rock. other wish its a good game. and when the killer camps it makes the game quite boring.
1;7.5/10Pros good fun with friends simpleCons heaps of bugs and issyes such as disconnects glitches getting frozen crashes heaps ranking system is forever worse than beta you need 5 people to start match making is awful repititive camper killers much much moreDespite all these many many issues its still a fun game. It does get a little annoying often though
1;This game is very good Mechanic Graphic overall is good. But one thing that i didn't like is the DLC killer is too OP. And killer have skill that make survivor hard to repair and it is toooo OP. i hope dev can nerf the DLC killer and add new map constantly. anyway this game is worth to buy if u have friend play this game too. i give 8.5/10
1;Just here to help against the review bombing games always have their downs and ups when it comes to balancing. This patch will bring in a new playstyle or will eventually be reverted if it really is that bad as some people think.The community is toxic btw so be careful with that but which online community isn't toxic at this point?
1;A good game that will definitely keep you entertained. If you don t mind waiting forever to get into a game getting dropped a few times in the process. Please don t get me wrong the game has a lot going for it but it has now been out for a while I would have hoped that long lobby waits glitchy gameplay and highly over powered killers would have been addressed and fixed by now
1;This Game is absolutely fantastic. It only has a couple mechanical bugs like when trying to get into or loading a game it wont load and you cant close the window. The game itself is great. It is thrilling and strategically challenging as a survivor and thrilling to hunt down survivors as the killer. The game has a big skill sealing so the game has long term playable value. Like I said the only BIG bugs were the loading which are frustrating at worst.
1;The game is only fun if you are playing with friends or you're the killer. Other than that it doesn't have much going for it. The Halloween update was a step in the right direction adding a classic killer. It is a good time waster till Fridat the 13th comes out.... Or so I thought. This game is the absolute baller when you are with a group of good friends. Must have for any horror and survival fans!
1;I got this game during Steam Summer sale and recently started playing as Fortnite is Doo Doo now. I can't believe I didn't try this game sooner I watched many friends on twitch play way back in October. Now I've been streaming it 8 hours a day grinding BP.I have close to 65 hours in 1.5 weeks I think that alone speaks for itself how good this game is! If you want to know more drop by my stream and I can show you how fun DBD can be!
1;Most of my friends have played around the 30 hours mark and they enjoyed themselves that was earlier days too when the bugs were a lot worse. I'd say this game is worth a try as it's a unique (or was until Friday the 13th) experience. Bugs aside. I'm going by what I've seen so far on my friends' broadcasts. It s genuinely a fun experience especially with your mates.
1;I highly recommend this game it is a fast paced horror game and is worth what you pay for it. The only problem is with the characters I feel it would be an extremely immersive experience if you could create your own character andunfortunately thatis not an option. Otherwise it is an extremely good game I hope this review was helpful.
1;Really good and fun game! only negative I have with it is that 70% of the time you can't connect to a game as a survivor and the game crashes I've spent 10mins opening and closing the game just trying to get connected. This needs to be fixed! I've never owned a game with such connection issues! But when it works its good.
1;Okay so obviously this game will have some problems like any other game this game is great it is a good concept they only issue I seem to have with the game is that the lobby isnt loading me into a game properly HOWEVER there is quiet a simple fix for that and it actually resolves the issue other than that I love this game and I recommend it.
1;"""This game is worth the buy. I do think they need to be careful because they're steadily walking into to """"pay to win"""" but so far they have done an excellent job at paying attention to what the players want and implementing it as well as implement additional content that improves the game. A lot of games charge for additional content before it's even finished but the devs for DBD haven't even come close to that."""
1;This game is a great game. As many online games there are toxic people and there are people who arent great at the game. Dont let the toxicity ruin the game. It is very fun. There are some bugs but they fix them fairly quick. The devs are doing their best and thats what matters.
1;Product received for free. That game makes alot of fun and i thing it should be added like an mechanic guy like an old dwight or jake that would be great with a perk which does like you can repair 1 gen instant per round/at the end and you can find more often in chests the box that would be so amazing i love this game
1;This game is an amazing experience and has amazing elements for example the level blood point system works in rewarding/supporting manner. The maps have high detail causing full on real feel environment leading to a thrilling bone chilling experience. The major issue I had is load times due lack of killer based population and user internet problems even if you have a great connection. Overall I give this game 8 out of 10 stars.Thank you for making this game happen
1;Ten outta ten for making one rage Ten outta ten for satisfaction when you kill that one annoying player or get away from a good killerTen outta ten would play againStill playing and havent been drawn away. Massively fun with friends and looking forward to the next dlc D
1;Absolutely amazing game. It still has its bugs and balance issues but that is to be expected from such a relatively new game. I can't wait to see the new features they plan on adding and watching this game take shape.Overall the feel of being in a horror film was perfectly captured! I would rate this game a solid 10/10 for its fun gameplay and great potential. It has worked its way into my favorites list.
1;The more DLC That is made the less thought through the characters become why is this? I Personally couldnt say but if you have to buy this game and then cant have fun because DLC users are overpowered because they BOUGHT the DLC I dont recommend this game. Btw if you are willing to buy the DLC and the game you may or may not lose interest in the either frustrating unfair ranked matches or the unfair overpower wins as the killer but thats up to you.
1;Dead by Daylight is so col game buy it to play togetherFIX your GAME i go to the EXIT i escape then the game bugg and CRASHSAY me The game is CRASHED i restard the GAME i am DEMOTED with 1 RANK ( full 3 pips)FIX YOUR GAME because the game is col and i want playTHIS is my favourite game i don't care it full of lags bugs and crashs and i am so good on it 1 RANk xD
1;The core concept of the game is amazing if you loved games such as L4D and Killing Floor you will no doubt enjoy this game as well.When this is said note that this game might be published as released though it has alot of problems with it's que and should propably be considdered Early Access it should here be said that the developers keep improving the game not only with new content but also with bugfixes and I am confident they will fix the queues eventually.
1;Really enjoying this game. The game was a little rough around the edges at first but the devs are doing a great job at supporting this game and listening to the community. The first DLC just dropped and on top of being fantastic it is also FREE...YES! Free DLC.....Great game a must buy for sure!!!After 40 hrs in I continue to love this game. Sure its not perfect and the graphics arent amazing by any means but amazing graphics arent always important...this game is just FUN!!!
1;"""Dead By Daylight can be summed up in one quote from Far Cry 3 """" Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same ing thing... over and over again expecting... to change... That. Is."""" Vaas 2012so if you like that line then buy this"""
1;Overall it's a good game and I would highly recommend this game regardless of the sale price. I've gotten hundreds of hours of entertainment already and it just keeps getting more content. The gameplay itself at times can be more addictive than anything else and it can also be extremely frustrating. But that's the nature of online competitive games right?Get in here and start hooking or start surviving.
1;Honestly I won't lie this game does have some problems that need to be worked on like matchmaking some bugs etc. But I def would recommend this game to anyone. If you play with friends it makes the game so much funner. I love the whole idea of the game and the concept.
1;"""So i started playing the Game and i was like """"hmm...looks interesting i guess?"""" But now after 600h Playtime ( I think that says everything.) i can gladly say that this game is nearly perfect...There are some balance changes or other decisions from the Devs side i don't agree with but they are doing a pretty good job so far. So if your looking for a cool game which you can play with your friends or alone ( try Dead by Daylight..."""
1;It takes a long while to get playing if I pair up with friends to survive not sure if it's a matchmaking management system thing or if they set it so that players that play alone end up with a higher priority to get into a killer's lobby. It's kind of annoying but the game itself is pretty dang fun. I'd say it's worth a purchase especially when it's on sale.Though I do wish I could get something out of killing my friends other than just practice.
1;Very glitch at this point to the point when I can't play the killer but I'm hoping the lobbies will get improved/fixed so that one day killer online will actually work for me ( Thryed everything to fix it as well as everything surggested to fix lobby bugs...
1;Dead By Daylight is a 1 vs 4 asymetrical hunt and survival game. One player is a killer who tries to hunt and kill 4 players who are survivers. The survivers must be stealthy and try to turn on generators which will then power on an exit for them to escape. The killer must find them and elimate them before this happens.If you ever played tag hide and seek or manhunt when you were a child this is that. Only more brutal. I highly reccomend it.
1;This game is heavily favored towards the killer no matter what ppl say bc i have played both survivor and killer and its a 50/50 with survivor but as killer u always kill at least 3 ppl bc every time i have played killer it was so easy and ppl said the nurse was hard to play and i played her for my first time and downed everybody within the first minute. The only reason killer mains get salty is bc they r so op they go in expecting to kill everybody and when they dont the get mad.
1;"""Beautiful game I've always wanted something like this and I have been waiting for Friday the 13th game but this will do for now I do wish it had a little more open world sometimes it does feel cramped and or a better way to communicate with your fellow survivors """"unless you have teamspeak"""" but overall I really enjoyed this game I played the crap out of it during the beta launch"""
1;Fun game in general not as buggy as it used to be and chasing around survivors is something I can easily do for hours. Game feels pretty complete with the dlc out have only encountered one major bug since the patch and that's in about 10 hours of play. A game well worth playing especially if you have 3 4 friends to survive with or hunt down.
1;This game is funny ! good game good idea but the ing invisible murderer is so hard to survivors. please fix it NERF INVISIBLE ASSASSIN. WHY THE ASSASSIN CAN SEE THE SURVIVOR TYPE LVL AND ITEMS BUT SURVIVOR CAN NOT SEE THE ASSASSIN ? THAT SUCK BRO ! ( INVISIBLE ASSASSIN SUCKS !!! ) PLEASE NEEEEERFFFF THAT TRASH BUSH ETC
1;I really enjoy this game yes it may have some glitches and bugs but the devs are quick to respond if you people report it to them and yes there is a lot of killers that like to camp and a lot of survivors that like to use jungle gyms but it's part of the game you just gotta learn how your opponent plays and learn to counter them just like any other game. This is a really fun game.
1;Very fun game however toxic SWFs are OP and will ruin your fun. If you win they cry and make 2747274897 excuses for why it's your fault and you played unfairly. You lose and they will call you a trash killer constantly. If salt doesn't offend you you will love this game.
1;Love the game only Juan complaint....Mah DweardI really need one and can't go to Pax like many so one way to get the Dweard for free is...Play DWIGHT!No one likes Dwight! You will be tunnel visioned the entire game and grow a Dweard!Your Welcome DBD Fans!
1;This game is awesome. Lobby errors plague the game and small things but they are getting less rare. If you are ok with ignoring the frustrations this game is ing fantastic. I think the devs have a lot of contact/interaction with the community which is also good. Hard to rate cause of the small issues but the actual game itself is A1. So awesome i decided to write my first review ever
1;me and 1 guy left hes waiting for me to die because he see hatch guy is level 10 and im level 20 sees guy getting in locker sees killer run to locker and spam crouch and run into it trying to tell them theres someone in there killer hits me i fall killer open locker catches and hooks guy guy dies im bleeding to death killer picks me up i dont struggle he brings me to hook he changes his mind and brings me to hatch lets me escape10/10
1;The game good graphics and its gameplay I loved it really the developers working on the game and trying to make it better but the balance they have is still there camping and tunnelling the game leaves much to be desired with such rules invented by the people themselves. While I give this game but who knows what will happen next.
1;Good game I usually play survivor but killers need a buff mainly hag and wraith. Good gameplay queueing with friends takes hours personally with the new update I never had the infinite loading screen but some of my friends say they have if you are wanting to be scared the only scary killer is Michael Myers Evil Within tier 1/2 OK game with lots of potential.

1;i have a good idea for dead by daylight what if in doing so it is muck strange to find clothes in boxes or when the game round ends you could get a drop that so you could put it on steam market or swap it with friends P.S I am Danish and I love the game
1;Killer disconnect from game all survivors' rank dropped??!! What sort of bug is this? Matchmaking can wait up to 10 15 mins and yet to get into any match?! The lag issues OMG Seriously trust me you won't even know where when how you dead BECAUSE OF LAG!!! Quite Exciting &amp Fun will recommend if BUGSssSSssss are fixed please
1;Alright I love this game and i wont lie... This is my favorite game on steam and it has ever sence i bought it. I say you should buy this. I mean i havnt got bored of it yet and ive been playing for about a year now. Like suriously I love this game so much I still dont know how this game doesnt have more players. It really should have more players also thank the people who made this really really fun game. I think they made a great job of this game.
1;Great game. It might be grindy but developers are working on that for the next patch to be a little less like that. Speacking about developers they are not very bright and often break things after a patch but they are very active and listen to their comunity
1;Probably one of my favorite games currently the changes made to leveling make this game a WHOLE lot easier for newer players. If this goes on sale I'd say it should be one of your priorities to buy although the developers seem to listen to killers more than they do to the survivors its still fun.
1;Do you like running around in infinite circles?Do like map development with no real thought put into it?WELCOME TO DEAD BY DAYLIGHT!If you like a community where people and moan this is the game for you!Even comes with free DLC!Edit They fixed infinite loops added some nice features. I'm sold on it again.
1;It feels like a bade console port despite being a PC exclusive game. The developers' grasp on competitive balance seems tenuous and the balance changes and updates show it. The community is toxic with both survivors and killers raging over any perceived slight no matter how minimal.That said game is just plain fun to play. It's a good game and if the problems get improved it could be a great game.
1;its a fun game when i do play it i have fun whether its running in fear from the killer or chasing the helpless survivors but this one problem keeps popping up sometimes when i choose join lobbey it will say failed to join and if i click join again the game stays in the searching for game mode i cant escape and have to restart my computer other then that good game just get on that problem asap
1;"""So I've played 20+ hours of this mostly as the Survivor and I love it! You'll see a few negative reviews because there's no """"Survive With Friends"""" feature yet but it is coming. As far as the gameplay it's very tense and unpredictable. Also there's no in game chat between survivors. You never know if the survivors you're paired with will help you or leave you to die. I'm having a blast with this. I highly recommend this game! It's amazing now and it will only get better!"""
1;Played 1 match in 20 minute. The match lasted 3 min before I got hooked. All of the rest of the time was spent waiting to join lobby. I can't wait for version 3.0.1 when hopefully the have all the bugs worked out and I can actually play the game instead of looking at the lobby.
1;I don t really know what to say about this game. Is it a piece of shi t? YES! But it s also good in some ways. When it s not lagging in lobby or in game or when I just launch it. I hope they are doing something about these bugs cause they ruining the whole game. Jeez
1;There is a bug that escapes the score link window after escaping the Devade game. However if you do a forced termination you lose both the Blood Web Points and the Ranking Points. I feel a very big anger about it. This bug occurs in several games not just one time. There is a bug that can not escape from loading the game room. This is a forced termination. However this does not eliminate the BloodWeb points and ranking scores. But it feels like anger. I hope to solve it.
1;Don't take the game too seriously. The matchmaking is horribly imbalanced and lag favors the killer beyond all reason. The community is toxic never read chat unless you wanna get called a or told to kill yourself for being rank 20.The game is fun though when you get a balanced match but there is only ranked mode. Prepare to get trolled by survivors you literally never see for 30 seconds with toolkits using brand new parts. 3 generators will be done by the time you hook the first thing you saw.
1;Product received for free. Great game though I wish there was some type of different gamemodes or something for more variety. Also matchmaking is kind of broken still have to constantly mash the ready up button when playing survive with friends. PLEASE MAKE AN AUTO READY UP SYSTEM.
1;Meanwhile at the office Cot� lets check youtube to see if anyone playing our game is doing it right so we can ban them10 Minutes later Cot� Ok I think banning all the youtubers who Tbag exploit in kyf was a good idea.Cot� Pretty good job so far.Meanwhile Wall hackers who record Cot� looks like they are using our secret easter egg perks O
1;"""decided to play killer. waiting in lobby for four people to join.""""hmm i guess ill use the restroom while i wait""""*a minute later*""""huh nobody joined yet. alright! i'll do things to occupy time!""""*a few trips to mexico russia becomes the first man on mars then returns*""""nobody still? it ill be a survivor for the 100th time""""Best game ever"""
1;Please please add group party up mode for friends who want to survive together. Until then players with friends spend literally half or more of their time contantly joining and leaving games looking for their friends.Game is great but a failure in that sense until they fix it.Still recommend they will most likely fix this
1;Well great game have one of the most toxic community never fix the old bugs or even new ones. I still enjoy the game until now but not for long i think. Devs should do something about facecamp cancer bugs blah blah blah if you want your game stop dying )
1;"""Good game to """"chill"""" when you dont have anything to do fear factor stealthy gameplay optimized to run on any potato interesting characters (movies/RL inspired)Some issues I feel they need to be adressed little choice of maps sloppy controls repetitive balance issues (among killers) waiting time in lobby no punishment for quitters"""
1;Fun game until you cant drop pallets bc of poor connection or you magically get downed without anything happening and the killer hooks you in a split second. Fun game idea stupid bugs and coding. Fix your in game instead of creating new killers that aren't neccessary until the game is decent.
1;I've been playing for two weeks now. The game is awesome really awesome but there is a toxic community. Many times you'll get to the point of smashing your keyboard because of the noobs that will dc at the start of the match or right after the killer gets them or because the killer will be a noob facecamper. Also the other time a survivor was trolling me after I healed him/her. He/she was clicking unclicking and teabagging. The killer got me and I lost my rank.
1;Ive been one of their pioneer players and it will always be my go to horror game or if I am looking for some nice co op plays with my friends. No regrets once you learn how to be a good survivor/killer you'll be immersed in the world of dead by daylight
1;The game is great and for the price tag I would definitely recommend getting it especially in a sale. Just be prepared that if you are a killer survivors often will blame you if they die and send you hate they forget it's a horror PvP it's not supposed to be fair.
1;DBD would be a great game but it's far from perfect. Full of bugs &amp glitches however it's still one of my favourite 'cause of community and for a lot of fun. Nowadays there are bunch of jerks and so it's most likely impossible to get a possitive feedback nor compliment. Sometimes just gg is enough ) I spent so many hours and probably will keep playing for a while because i play games for fun.
1;Overall fun game even with all the bugs. It feels like the game is more survivor sided with there being more and more perks and balances to make the game easier for them. Really wish the devs added more things to make it fun. Like custom KYF where you could change the amount of survivors gens killers and have some community made maps. However in its current stance the game is a bit unbalanced and there are things that game could change.
1;I love this game. A lot of people whine about changes and such (or lack of) but it's a small company and the game is $20 be realistic. This game has a lot of replay value but seems very simple at first which is good as that makes it easy to get into and leaves plenty of depth to learn about as you play more.
1;I got this game a little while ago and I have to say very good! I played a few games and though I found it rather challenging I quickly became quite a lover of the game and play it frequently. Great job to all of the people who developed and continue to develop on this magnificent game and I can't wait to see where they take it.
1;The game itself is very nice. Easy to learn hard to master. You gotta learn all the perks and stuff. But here comes the community of this game (It s a total cancer). If you want to play killer without Hex Ruin then nope. You re gonna kill 1 person at most. The rank reset is a t too how a new player can play against some 2k hours killer? It s pretty decent but still needs a lot of changes and fixes. But still I love it.
1;Fun to screw around on or to take seriously but high ranks definitely are full of messing around. With some nice headphones it is pretty easy to get immersed in the tension matchmaking is great as well generally. As someone who is terrified of horror I enjoy this game's edge. Grouping with friends is fun but it does suck as killer to be against 4 man parties all the time. Overall highly recommend for anybody.
1;This is a really fun game. the only problems it has is that there is really long queue time for killer ATM.one of the most annoying things is that if you play with your friends you have to reinvite them after each game and that really sucks. otherwise it's really really fun
1;Great Horror Game A+++++This Game Is So Good It Makes Me Feel Like Im In The Game itselfThe Survivors Have A Great BackStory And They're Abilitys Are Really Useful To SurviveThe KIllers Put A Challenge To The Survivors To Make Them Work Hard And Make Them Focus And Makes The Survivors Use TeamworkAnd This Is Why The Game Is Great
1;Dead by daylight is a fun and interacting game where 4 survivours have to do 5 generators in order to escape the trial. I enjoy this game because its a family friendly game except if you are playing against a nurse thats just straight up bullying. I enjoy 360ing the killer and pallet looping him. My favorite part is at the end where you get to chat with the killer it sometimes gets heated up. Its a great game.
1;"""A 1 vs 4 game an interesting concept as I thought when it came out.Game has lots of bugs updates which """"fix"""" them though kinda not.Reeeaaaaally hate campers but noone pays attention to them by them I mean game developers.If there are no campers it's a really fun game.And with friends it's really good.Though the game is rather pricey better buy it on sale"""
1;i like the game and with out a second thought i would say that i have suck up to this game BUT and that i big but i had enough of these review that are about the windows and wooden blocks it can be hard beening the killer and the survivor. with that said if someone leaves or DC they should be penalice for it. with that said this game just came out of baiter and they only had one map and one killer so there going to be things that need to be fixs
1;My cousin Reyaad Malaka got so scared of this game that he refunded it. If you enjoy horror games I suggest you try this one out. I have experienced no bugs long matchmaking times or any problems with the game. The only downside of the game would be that you need at least one or more friends to play with. Otherwise the gameplay feels fresh along with a variety of killers maps and strategies you can utilize. It actually makes you feel as if you were in a horror movie.
1;Dead by Daylight keeps disconnecting me and I don't know what to do please help because it happened after the new update came out. I start in a lobby and then couple minutes later 3 people disconnect leaving one person left and its so annoying. Please Help me fix this someone.
1;The game is very well build aside from all the crazy glitches in the game! i really enjoy it but to be honest the community on this game is just There's always so much hate going on in the game. Blaming other survivors or the killer for mistakes that you made But other than that this game is great.
1;in my view this game is great. its a new experience to the gaming world and i can see it develope more i play it. It has its sucky moments to like glitching through walls and map but you get use to it. Camping isn't wrong but it make everone mad but hopefully the Devs. fix that. As so i like this game and give it a try. see you in the fog.
1;I love this game. Its easily my favorite game. This game will keep you entertained for hours days months possibly even years. Each round is different and there's many killers and survivors to choose from. Each killer has different powers and perks and its really fun to go against these different killers. My only complaint about this game is that the community can be very toxic at times.
1;Awesome game! always get's intense when playing and gives you abit of a adrenalin rush haha. Only down side is sometimes you need to search for a game a couple of times due to matchaking problems. It's cool how you can play against mates or survive with them but half the time matchmaking with friends wont work.
1;The gameplay and game concept is amazing. There are a handful of bugs but I have been playing the game for about 2 years now I think and the developers are constantly fixing and improving the game. Most importantly it is one of those games that I find myself playing all throughout the year. Its replayability is great and the gamplay is constantly challenging and rewarding. GET IT NOW!
1;Play hide and seek when you was a kid? Imagine that but with death and creapy monster hunting you down!At first it is scary.. you get nervous when the killer gets close to you. But when you plya mroe and more you get use to it. One tip for new players (survivors). Play the game expecting to die if you escape etc its a bonus!
1;I personally love dead by daylight and support anyone who plays it. i've tried to get my friends to play but they won't. Ilike this game because you can tell there anways adding new killer and survivors and their not going to stop any time soon. I rate this game 10/10
1;Saw DLC is way overpowered for the Killer (where did the heartbeat go? i'm getting smashed without ANY warning all the time). Why bring BS without a well balanced and well overthought gameplay? Doesn't make any sense for me. I'm reaching the point of playing without ANY gear because i know im gonna lose it all. Unless i have a FREAKIN good survivor team. Exactly the same complaints since the game was launched. For now i'll quit any game with the saw DLC. Waste of time.
1;The game is great and lots of fun but honestly i would not recommend the game in its current state! The game always freezes on me when im trying to join a freaking match ! literally have to close the game and relaunch it and it's just a repetitve cycle. They NEED TO FIX THE BUGS WHEN FINDING MATCHES !!!! SOOOOO FRUSTRATINGEDIT The game is now fixed. it only freezes on me every like 10th game instead of 10 before 1 match the game is really fun and addicting
1;this game is so much fun but devs can be downy sometimes with updates especially since I IN HATE STANDOFFS THEYRE SO ANNOYING YOU CAN LITTERALLY STAY THERE FOR DAYS AND THE LOSER WILL JUST SIT ON THE HATCH LIKE THATS NOT FUN AT ALL DEVS CMON WTF. other than that pretty decent game.
1;great game overall however i would like dedicated servers rather than the killer hosting it it is so laggy if you get the wrong killer and it's not your fault! thankfully ping testing is a thing whitch works 90 percent of time but the rest of the game is great
1;Just got the game a few nights ago and played 5 hours with a few friends. It is fun...until you run into hackers. . . I get there are perks but I know there is not one that shows the killer right where other players are. Great expirience if you want to play only with your friends and no randoms. Wish it was different but I guess it is what it is. Still worth it! Just not worth the time in ranked matches.
1;The match making if awful rank 20 survivors against rank 1 assassin. I do think that s a big deal. Also it s hard to find a match when playing with friends. Not fair that if the assassin leaves the match you get only the points you ve done so far. People still get kicked out when the game is starting so you end up with 3 survivors and a good ranked assassin. The idea of the game if really good but fixing the match making would make it so much more enjoyable.
1;I like the game. I just recommend If you can nerf the time limit for Michael Myers I think its to long for the insta down. other than that its a fun game you get to play with your friends and try to survive till the end fix all generators and open the gate was a good idea. Also i would like if there was a perk for the killers that when the hatch opens it only last for a certant amount of time but you can only get it by the shards.
1;toxic player like me .Noobs.lot of bugs.don't buy this stupid game.i have 600h and this game is so stupid and cance. players are toxic and have a scramble brain.killers are not balaced are so f**king easy to kill a survivor and i se myers with chainsaw nurse with chansaw and the DLC are so ing broken like freddy like doctor myers leatherface and the survivors are so hard to play to survivor and killer are so op and easy.and you can get ban so easy.dont buy this game
1;11/10 very balanced game from the very first release until now the developers have been buffing the Killer and nerfing the Survivors.Probably this is the reason why the community has dropped so much and it takes about 5 minutes to make a bloody match.And if you accidentaly join a fricking match the killer disconnects..The game is one of my favourites but the waiting is really killing me.
1;Ever since the game's license was acquired by the developer the game has just been getting better and better! The devs have shown their commitment to improving the game a commitment driven by genuine passion and love of their product.However in it's current state it still has some of the issues that have plagued it from day one maybe wait for a sale unless you really love asymmetrical horror games because of the current offerings I'd say this one is the best.
1;Super fun. They're are some people on this game who exploit minor bugs and some who go out of their way to be unsportsmanlike by 'tunnelling the same person' (Following the same person all game to kill them specifically) and then others who use bugs to cheat and make the killer leave but if you get some great teammates then you can easily have fun
1;if you're looking for a game that basically simulates being in a movie then dead by daylight is the right game for you.Dead by Daylight is a game where you have to accomplish certain objectives to escape there's an indication when the killer is near which are heartbeats. there are tutorials when you first launch the game that'll teach you the basics of the game good luck campers (or killers)
1;Fun game when you can actually get into a game. Half the time you will spend is searching for a lobby. There should be an afk check before the game in lobby and while searching for a lobby this will reduce queue times and player in game afk/disconnects.
1;This game is freaking awesome getting to play a off serial killer that sacrifices you to dark gods or playing as 4 pissy little pubescent teens trying to hide from him pretty awesome if you ask me so overall this game is awesome just a little glitchy here and there fulfill your dream and murder people you don't or never liked!! xD
1;Dead by daylight is a fun co op horror game best played with friends.It is quite a grind to get good perks and items etc but there are addons which give you more bloodpoints(the currency)In conclusion it is a great game i reccommend this to horror fans
1;Love this game i think its an awesome concept and is being executed very well. however the queing system is absolute garbage if you have a survivour party the is more than just yourself. and anyone willing to pay 7 dollars for michael myers has essentially won every game they will ever play as killer.
1;I love it when I get face camped by the killer. Or tunneled by the killer. And I basically die instantlyBut then I remember there are more toxic things in this game like flashlighs or d strike or pallett loopingSo the killer dc's and I de rankRlly fun game11/10Would get face camped again
1;"""Improve report system of people who disrespect killers ) because right know i see zero respect from survivors after the trial ends ) F.E When survivor survive (Rank 19) he/she acts level head pretending that he/she is pro and then words """"n**b"""" * """"idiot"""" ect apears in the chatAnother notice Mostly i see russian people disprespect killer after the trial. I am more survivor player."""
1;"""This game is super addictive and awesome. However the matchmaking is terrible! It takes so long to find a game and there is only one way to join a lobby. Each time I click on """"join a lobby"""" it either says it failed to join or it'll seem like it finds a game but shortly takes me back to the same screen. I really wish there was a way to make this a more efficient matchmaking. I would rate this game 5 stars if it weren't for that issue. Please look into this!"""
1;2 generators left2 survivors left to killfound one survivor he is juking me but still manage to get a hitstill juking me around a house i finally about get the down hitslashes hammer Falls off the mapGG will fall off the map againEven tho there are bugs and dcs they just need to fix that and thats it
1;Been playing this game for two years absolutely in love with it and don't plan on quitting. Every match has it's own unique interactions and never ceases to amaze me. Only bad thing I'd have to point out in this game is Survivor Salt and Survivor entitlement. Stick through it soon to be Killer mains!
1;Besides how hard it is to get into a game (sometimes) this game is awesome. I was obsessed with it when I first got it and now I can never stop playing it. Whether the match goes in my favor or not it's just such a fun game in general and I love the challenges the game has. Good good game I HIGHLY reccommend it.
1;this is a pretty good loading screen simulator if I was working on a game I would definitely have the loading screen DOWN! Of the 220 hours I have probably under 1/3 was waiting in a queue. As for the gameplay when I'm not playing the nurse (lagging my off blinking around) it is actually pretty fun.10/10
1;It makes a lot of fun... when you are good and play the game since a long time (me 380h). But there are so many bugs and now while the summer bbq event you arent able to play the game it's just not letting you go in the main menu.Thanks a lot for the dumbest devs in the world.
1;"""Was rank 18 solo survivor against a rank 20 Pig.Escaped from the killer 2 times and ended the match by going in the hatch.Got called as a """"fxxking hacker"""" """"a hacking noob fa**ot"""" my families and ancesters cursed.999/10 would escape through hatch again"""
1;its a very fun game! the devs do weekly streams and will update the game fix it and try to put out new content and dlcs. every game will have toxicity in it but ive found some friends and players that are fun to play with. swf is really fun and so is killer please try out both and play both for a good 100 hours before you complain about the other side you can still be a killer or survivvor main but jjust try to understand the other side.
1;Very fun to play both sides but you will occasionally face bad killers that literally camp hooked players making it impossible to save the hooked player. Meanwhile the remaining players do the generators and still win the game. Still Very annoying for the surviving side. Also there are some very strong perks that can give you wallhack almost but these are very rare. Also fun to play with friends (so you can ensure that you have rather competent and fair players D )
1;It's good by the sound you will always get fear but this is not the game like you will spend 5hours straight its just like you can play it if your boring on other games and play it like 3hours8/10 or 9/10 but idk the game is goodSo i edit it i got addicted in to this game not what i like said on the first one if you get the right play you will be addicted as survivor and play it and play it again 10/10
1;Pretty damn good game after updates and changes to some perks there is still issues surrounding the game but I mean what game doesnt have its issues. Overall I have encountered no game breaking stuff or anything that has made the game less fun. Killer can be agrivating at first but you learn as you go and gain new perks and get better. Overall I give this a 8.5/10. Fun to hop on every now and then.
1;Product received for free. Dead by Daylight people must fix a bug that the killer gets stuck in the pale when it takes a survivor and the one that does not take the exit and you have to go through the trapdoor.See my profile to see what the killer will upload the photos now
1;BugSo I have played the killer and everything would be nice if I could hook the survivors somewhere else that the cellar.I don't know why but all hook ecept that in the cellar were invisibal and I couldn't hook anybody on it.The only thing I could see were the christmas lamps from the hook but the hook itself wasn't there.
1;"""I enjoy this game. Match making needs to be fixed and we doo need the option to have our own key bindings as well as join public games with our friends. But as its still pretty early I'm not going to knock the game for it. It can be very suspensful and theres plenty of """"Oh """" moments to be had. If you like spoopy games this one is worth a try."""
1;Ignore the haters no asymmetric game is perfectly balanced but this one is fun an interesting up unti lthe point of you being a borderline professional at which point you need to reevaluate some life choices. Getting spam bad reviews because of some balance changes that as per usual have rustled some jimmies.
1;Its a realy nice Game makes lots of fun ! Soundtrack + Gameplay as Survivor / Killer + Nice Levels + To add ons +Very nice game but at start for beginners a little hard cause the need first grind his Perks what can help tham to survive or increase his chance to survive.This Game will bring you lots of fun and maybe scare u try it out !!!
1;Dead by Daylight. An intense game of cat and mouse. Either an stressful attempt to keep you and your team alive or a brutal game of playing with your food and hunting your pray. dead by daylight is a fun game which ever way you play it as a survivor or a killer although at times can be a little glitchy.
1;"""The amount of fun I had on this game was insane yes there are a few people who ruin the experience in some matches by leaving early or just be a**holes but hey isn't that all online games?Pro tip nothing strikes fear into the heart of killers more than """"The Helicopter"""" (picture a downed survivor spinning on the spot like a rotor blade)."""
1;Great game that will keep u on the edge of your seat if you're a survivor that is. Only downside i can think of is the crashing every now and then when trying to play with friends it just takes you back to the main lobby and you have to invite/get invited again. Haven't experienced this with random players though.Still good game and great for cardiovascular exercise would develop spontaneous arrhythmia at the sight of Michael Myers again/10
1;Do you like playing games that make you salty? This is the game for you. Play killer? Going to be salty. Play survivor. Yup. No matter what side you play players in the community will always have something to complain about how you play. Fun game though.
1;If I could say one bad thing about this game it would only be that there are hackers in this game. Dead By Daylight is possibly one of the greatest survival horror games out there. Not only that The developers are such nice folks and kind hearted. If you're looking into buying Dead By Daylight do it.
1;I like this game but they should add more modes other than trying to start all the generators and escaping. A really easy example is one where you try to survive the killer for as long as possible they could even try something like a multi killer gamemode with more survivors aswell. Anyways it's a good game worth the money just a bit bland.
1;DBD is a 4 v 1 game with the killer against survivors but its duable for the survivors with the techniques of 360 180 flashlight saves and much more. Being good at this game will definetively get you juking a killer. Well in other wise if you're lucky go for attempting to escape the hook . (im not going to end this review because i don't have time)
1;This game is an addiction. You know its bad for you. It makes you question what you're doing with your life... and it enfuriates you... but you keep coming back for more like the masochist your psychologist told you you were. If you like a frequently bugged and broken game that you can't walk away from this is for you!!!!
1;After months of playing Dead by Daylight no doubt in my mind that I enjoyed it. Very fun concept of a game but can get repetitive for some. This game has many exploits and bugs but the devs constantly patch it in order to please the fans. With every patch comes a new bug or exploit. There isn't any dedicated servers the connection will be depended on the host which is the killer. Despite all of the exploits bugs and annoying fanbase this game is straight up fun to play.
1;Eclipsing over 400+ hours in this game I can honestly say it's been a overall positive ride. The only real complaint at this point is top tier killer balance. High level Nurse and HB play is broken.Otherwise would TB before jumping down the hatch again. 10/10.
1;Product received for free. I really like the risky ness of this game and the intensity. I also enjoy how each game has a new feel and its own flow. Dead by Daylight combines a scary game with some funny scenarios. I play Survivor more often than killer but I enjoy doing both so far. They continue to update and balance the game as well as they can and are leaning toward creating something great!.
1;I'm just gonna say OMG this game is so much fun and you get so pumped up! Love that they had it for free during this weekend and that my brothers told me about it. We had so much fun playing this game! BUTI lost my progress once and had to leavel up all my characters again. I did mail and did not get anything back a long while ago. Well well I do good without anything but its just sad to loose everything you worked hard for .
1;Its a nice game with many diffrent killers and survivors. Each Killer is diffrent and needs another style to play. But this game has some Bugs and the Devs try to fix them and make this game more than awsome. I love this game and can deffinitly say Best Game for me!
1;This game has come a long way since its release. Its had its ups and its definately had its downs. But somehow it still remains one of the best 4v1 games on not only Steam but also console. I adore this game and I give every one of you reading this the urge to play this game and enjoy it as much as I have.
1;Great game ! Pros Its very fun It is well optimized You can play with friends easy I love the graphicscons Bugs Campers.I really reccomend this game to all it is not too scary but its fun i dont like how there can be some .The game does have bugs but it is only a game that has been out for 7 months so give it a rest I recomend this game.
1;This game has come a long way since its release. They have really fixed a bunch of issues and bugs that made it nearly impossible to play. You can tell they have been listening to the fans of the game. The gameplay never gets old and the fact that they added Halloween and Michael Myers akes it that much more fun!
1;The only downfall to this game is how long matchmaking takes. If you solo queue in a quick play then it is alright but if you try to play with your friends it doesn't matter if you have a for party or not matchmaking just seems to take forever. The game mechanics are good. And is evenly matched when it comes to matchmaking. Please fix the matchmaking times because this game has been out for a yearor so and still having the same problem.
1;This game is awesome. Ignore the people complaining about individual mechanics and stuff like that. The devs are constantly updating the game with patches and gameplay tweaks alike and for as long as I've been playing the game (a long time) I have always been able to escape as a survivor or kill as a killer. If you're looking for a different kind of multiplayer experience then this is the game for you.
1;It is a pretty fun game a little scary at first but you get used to it. I recommend using headphones when playing because there a lot of audio cues that can be very helpful once you understand how they work. It can be a little laggy and sometimes has a long wait time to find a room. Overall its a pretty fun game that makes people play mind games on the killer or the other way around. I highly recommend this game.
1;I have had so much fun playing 400+ hours in this game and I am not even close to being tired of playing it yet and I'd say that's worth $20. The game does have bugs and its not entirly balanced but it's a lot of fun. It also may be hard for new players to get into it because the grind is steep but it's worth it.
1;A couple of glitches here and there and sometimes quite a bit of lag depending on the host. However it is one hella scary game with nice mechanics and characters. Good level system cool skins maps and one heck of an atmospheric vibe with the music and heartbeat combined and just the general sound.

1;I love this game! it's fun its spooky it's an adrenaline rush. most of the people complaining don't put the time into the game and give up after the smallest bug or probably a killer who can't counter a window/pallet hopper. i love this game so much i can't stop playing it!

1;Speaking from a Killer's perspective!This game has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay. Learning the basics and getting more and more refined in your gameplay and perks is alot of fun. Climbing up ranks is not too challenging even when you play versus lvl 1 (highest lvl) survivors its still manageable and a lot of fun. For 20 bucks totally worth a buy for me.
1;I bought this game like one month ago and I can say that this game is amazing. I have 145h in it and you never get bored because of the content.. There's always a new killer with some new tactics new teammates with other perks.. Now I am rank 1 survivor and rank 6 killer. 10/10 for this game! JUST BUY IT you won't regret your decision!
1;I hope to the hag's perks has more useful. it more depended on totem. (lighted candel totem) I recommend about it that detroy all totem not one lighted candel totem to dismagic the hag's perk or lighted candel totem can self recovery. I hope that be the hag is more playful killer.
1;Pretty fun game whether you're playing alone or with friends if you're into fast pase hide and seek type horror games this is the game for you. Admitably there are some bugs within the game but if the developers looked into them they should be an easy fix. One of them being that if you do play with a party of friends you have to re send an invite every game you play. But asides from that fun game!
1;This game is still in BETA despite being launched in my opinion. However if you like glitchy funny games that will be fixed in the future soon buy it. I told myself that this game would die quickly but I have fun playing with and without friends and I'm glad I gave it a chance.
1;When i bought this game i had already heard of alot of people playing it and some twitch streamers playing. This game is very easy to learn and fun to play. It is more of an arcade game but has decent amount of progression in skills and leveling up characters. It is still fairly new and has many bugs (not gamebreaking) but it seems they are being addressed one by one.
1;I love this game. I own all the DLC I bought it to support the devs and unlock the new killers. This game does have flaws. There are animated parodys all over youtube of all of the flaws this a game has. The devs really work hard at getting rid of these bugs most of them have been fixed (New ones show up now and then though). It's really alot of fun and if it's on sale you need to buy it.
1;I honestly didn't expect much from this game but I am having a blast! Being a survivor is geinuinely firghtening and very intense to try and not only survive but decide whether to help other survivors. Being the killer frantic and a ton of fun. When I played as a survivor I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb everywhere I went but it is quite amazing how much you don't see as the killer.Overall great fun!
1;I love this game but still the devs need to balance the game. Some killers use god addons and win in the first 2 minutes of the game or all of the survivors carry around toolboxes and genrush the mach. However the game is pretty fun and i would recomend you too buy all the dlc ( when on sale ) apart from Freddy that killer is a piece of
1;Want horror? Yes then it's for you.Want a break from RTS or shooters? Then yes it is for you.Want puzzles and t to be a reality? Welcome to the world baby.Want to play as a cerial killer? Then you're dream is a reality.This game is extremely good for everyone. If you want a break from other games then get this game! Also as a tip get the Deluxe edition if you have Payday 2 to get some free stuff.
1;I have spent a lot time with this game and it really delivers the thrill of the hunt both as killer and as survivor. It has had some problems with balancing and ingame issues but the devs are fixing stuff in every patch. Some problems still stand like randomly crashing games on several systems or lobby issues but this game still is just too much fun to let me not love it.
1;I find this game incredibly fun even with it's random bugs. The only problem i have with this game is the campers ESPECIALLY the face campers but that issue is slowly getting better. The graphics are good If your moniter isnt the size of a medium sized tv and the gameplay is really fun in my opinion.I would definatly recommend this game and i have already to friends.EDIT Some of the bugs are hilarious i once went most of the game floating.
1;"""Since the latest Patch came out and the killers where able to place traps etc. faster This game became Killers got buffed and survivors got nerved by changing thier addons.. Its nearly impossible for bot """"Tryhards"""" to survive and play this game... It was so much fun to play this game but now i m just getting angry everytime I play this..."""
1;This game is one of my favorite games. I spent the most time on this game (xbox and pc about 1000 hours) and i still love it. It's unique it's fun alone and with friends and it feels different almost every game. It is frustrating as a noob but becomes more bareable with the more perks and skills you acquire. 10/10 from me
1;With New Upgraded System New Patches New Weapons New Vehicles and the Ongoing Improvement Process this is the BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED.IRL You can tell me go to mountain to exercise hunt a rabbit skin it cook it and eat it I'll tell u go F*ack yourselves In this game I do this every single day to keep surviving 10/10
1;I know the game is buggy ( for it being out for 2 years) but I still can't get enough of it. I love this game and even though I might get mad and angry when a Michael HAS INFINITE ING EVIL WITHIN 3 AND JUDITHS TOMBSTONE I know I will still come back to play it. So please BUY THE GAME AND PLAY WITH ME PLEASE I AM LONELY.
1;"""now you may be thinking to yourself 'a game where four people try and survive against a terrible murderer? sign me up!""""its a ing liethe killer is the victim surrounded by four empowered black women with flashlights.and as all four victims make their escape you have to watch in dread as they stop to teabag you pressing their feminine ballsacks into your face. it was at that point i had started crying"""
1;At the beginning the game was pretty unplayable and unfun. Campers cheaters etc. Now the developers are trying their best to make this game as much playable as possible and I finally found this game entertaining and fun. I recommend now much more than I would ever had before it's current state.
1;I really love this game it fun and gives a nice mix of thrill and excitement either you play as a killer or survivor. also to play as/from both perspectives gives it a good variation and different feeling depending on what side you choose to play. what more fun it that as you play with other ppl online you never now what to expect and some time some really interesting stuff can happen too.
1;"""Best """"hunting"""" game available right now that doubles up as a thrill survival game. Developers are very engaged and active about what's happening DLCs and payment system have been great. Highly recommended for people who like asymmetric PvP survival games!PS Just have a good mentality ready to consume salt from entitled players mostly survivors."""
1;I really like this game it stands out. I don't know much about graphics and such so i will avoid saying anything about that. Adding the option to play against bots could be a great update so that new players could get a hang of it before getting slaughtered online. I wish that they would make some kind of penalty to the killer when said killer is camping at hooked survivors
1;Very much enjoying the latest patch. Unloved killers given a major boost bad perks being significantly improved to make the perk meta more interesting and the balance between killers and survivors is probably as good as it's ever been. Game has improved significantly since BHVR took full control and am looking forward to what they have in store for the future.Highly recommended.
1;People always complain... yes there are some bugs. Which game doesn't have bugs? The concept behind this game is awesome. My heart races the music and sounds make me panic sometimes.. I haven't had a horror movie feeling in a long time and this game gives it to me. Over all this game is well worth the money. I haven't been this addicted to game in a long time.
1;Super addictive game. Play mainly as a survivor and it is wayyyyy too hard to put this game down. Matchmaking isn't perfect but at least it is quick ) Developers are super responsive and listen to the comunity's feedback! Couldn't recomend this game any more!
1;"""With nearing 400 hours at the time of the review I know what I'm talking about when I summarise the game with this """"Good Game. Not So Good Devs."""" They're active but they do muck up. Alot. Alot Alot. Like took them months to fix a bug where match making was broken."""
1;takes elements from childhood games e.g.hide and seek and chase and throws them into a foggy area of death.great game that has genuine moments of panic tension and sheer enjoyment.still has some bugs but the devs keep on top of problems and do their best to sort them out in a timely fashion.BUY THIS GAME!!!
1;What a game!I find it very addicting. Maybe too much? )I prefer this to Friday 13th. (as the two get compared a lot)Right now I'm actually refreshing the page every hour or so to check if the new killer (the one from Saw movies) is in. Any time now... ) But yeah if you're on the fence unsure whether to buy it... do it. Just do it! ) Feed your inner serial killer.
1;Very good game. Fantastic atmosphere everything is perfect !There is only one thing that should be changed You get a derank when you are a survivor and the killer leaves ingame that should not be !But it's a very good game and i hope that more stuff will be coming out.
1;"""People are complaining just because they made it so survivors actually have to have some sort of game sense to win don't be discouraged by them if you are interested in the game and feel its on for a good price grab it. It isnt pay to win It isnt grind to win The community isnt """"super toxic""""Its just a fun game and a good experience and I pray that behaviour does not revert the changes they made this patch it was a very needed patch"""
1;Stopping by to leave a review because Survivor mains are currently having a tantrum actively trying to ruin the games reputation as a result of the recent and much needed buff to two killers that were otherwise unviable to play in the higher ranks. The game is very fun and while balance is still an issue the Developers are heading in the right direction.
1;You need a lot of patience for this game. There is a bit of a learning curve and even when you've learnt all you can you'll have a lot of bad games as surv and killer.This is a strategy game more than it is a horror game.It's flawed its got bugs its survivor sided in balance but its charming. You get hooked to it.
1;Great game! Although the game has its problems (p2p balance issues exploits?) its sertainly worth the money Give it some time tho the first few hours can be hard for both killer and survivor. Devs are still bringing new killers and survivors to the game. But whatsup with that Survive with friends lobby.. after every game you have to join eachother again. kinda anoying.8/10
1;I love dead by daylight its a really good game and i really do recommend playing it. its heart racing and keeps you at the edge of your seat. however i'm absolutly off at how the creaters made michale myres soooooooo OP that it doesn't give anybody any chance in surviving which completely ruins the game. I get that michale was hella OP in the movies but a game like this needs to be fair on both the killers and the survivors sides not a pay to win.
1;very fun game great conceptbut god damn sometimes I'll be loading games and lobbies for 30 minutes just bugging in and out and having infinite loading times without ever playing gamePlease fix glitches before adding even more buyable stuff while the base game barely worksinvest in servers pl0x
1;Overall a good horror game but there are still issues and bugs with the game. The devs try to patch/ fix but it takes time. Once you get past the rank 20s teammates face camping killers and bots you'll realize it's an OK game. It's just a game try to enjoy it. I really enjoy playing 4 man SWF.
1;"""Great game but I feel the devs need to focus on fixing the bugs and server connectivity issues before releasing anymore useless DLC. Me and my buddy have more luck getting into a game together by random queue than actually playing """"survive with friends"""". Kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Overall I really enjoy the game though."""
1;Let's keep this short this game is for you if &gt you're an sadistic psychopath who likes to creep the out of other people &gt you're an sneaky stealth ninja with 1337 run&amp hide skillz &gt you're addicted to some serious bloodrush and adrenaline attacksand yes its totally worth it.
1;Great game overall but really buggy even this long after release. Devs should fix the bugs then deal with balancing issues afterward rather than just release new dlcs without fixing the core game issues. It's concerning how many people lose their data I personally deal more with infinite load times and always we lose 1 survivor at the start of a match so most my games 3 survivor vs killer which sucks.
1;I bought this game a few days ago and I'm hooked. I have played both roles as the killer and survivor and they are equally exciting. I love how challenging it can be in both roles to out smart the other and it really gets exciting when the chase is on! The only thing I wish they would fix is the the trappers had limitations to setting traps under the sacrifices and the lobby/joining game bugs and crashes. But other than that it balances out well for both sides. Amazing game worth the money!!!!
1;The game is alot of fun however as the game is undergoing active development still you need to understand that the game is in an evolving state and the content will be changing. be it minor or major change.But at this point this game is a riot for group play and still really fun solo.
1;It's hell good. I just have some problems about the promotion. It's so unfair that I lose promotion points because of a lot of people dont understand that helping each other is the core objective to escape.....matchmaking is so shuffled sometimes i get rookies sometimes i get pros...idk what depends on that. Anyway the game is perfect.
1;Outsmarting Simulator 201X ) it's a blast to play moderate learning curve (good thing! creates rewarding &amp enjoyable progression). High level play is all about mindgames the ability to preform split second deductions and subsequently adapt all with a timer ticking away in your head regarding a Trial's (match) various windows of opportunity.
1;They keep adding in new content which is great and they try to listen to the community which is also great. Only down side is the toxic community and slick learning curve thats abusive with toxic people.7/10 heckin spookyEdit Devs keep updating the game for the worst as of now. Lotta features broken and others diluted. 5/10 Heckin Spooky Patches
1;"""I do know that I don't have many ours on the game compared to everybody else but hear me out. It is a fun game however yes I know it has it's problems which can make the game less fun. But when it's fun it's really damn fun. You won't run into those """"perfect games"""" everytime but if you're skilled enough you should be able to win. It is fun."""
1;Game is fun alone but very fun with friends even though Friday 13 murdered this game like it was my lightwork for a little bit it is starting to come back the developers always update and the killers are nice except the PIG this killer is ridiculously sneaky even sneakier than the survivors please give the Pig a terror radius because the Pig has 3 abilities instead of 1 which includes Stealth Lunge Mask.
1;Pretty cool game especially after you invested some time in understanding everything in the game. Nice learning curve not to hard to start out with but becomes harder the more you play as for you get matched with people of your skill level. Besides that you get to either face your fears as a killer hunts you down or you get the pleasure of putting people on meathooks. Also praise the spidergod 10/10 would sacrifice againHail lord Dwight and sleep thight
1;How To off 99% of players as killer 1. Take first victim 2. Place victim on hook3. Directly just stare at victim while they stare back in rage4. Once victim dies repeat the same thing to the next victim and so on5.When taken to end lobby watch the puppets dance in the chat one by oneResult XD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;135h.4 survivors Hook one of them All 3 friends stay around hook You are not leaving Down another one 2 Friends running around hook You are not leaving Hooked one dies downed gets saved 2 escapes one hits you with an infinate juke spot.After 15 mins infinate bastard s up and you kill them.End of match.After the match you read 137 msg how bad you are becouse their friends died. becouse you didnt leave the hook when all 4 were in you sight.
1;Dead By Daylight is an amazing asykmetrical horrottlr experience although matchmaking can take a while and sometimes the rank ratios are unbalanced but the core gameplay is fun and worth it.To be honest if anyone tells you you are doing something wrong as killer most of the time keep doing it because if it pisses survivors off it is fine by me.Currently survivors on the whole are stronger than killer but hopefully the upcoming update will help a lot with how we play the game.
1;Ignore the salty survivor reviews cos they were and died this game is fun to play killer or survivor u can choose to be a and nt help people but that may make it worse for u when u try to survive work together unless ur killer then go ham on people and hook em like a butcher its great to play with friends and ull most likely survive more
1;spent 157 hours on this game stayed with it since the beta 10/10 would play again. In all seriousness I watched this game grow from being a new and glitchy prototype to a legit and FUN triple A level release. Best AND only horror game I play well worth the price.
1;First I would like to say I truly enjoy this game. Originally I am a console gamer but through out the years I have slowly shifted towards PC gaming. But today for the first time I (for some reason) am not able to play as a survivor or a killer. I know this is probably some bug but it needs to be fixed because I can only imagine what other gamers with this experience have to say about the matter. I will leave a thumbs up because I love this game but you NEED to fix this bug! Long live DBD...
1;While the gameplay is quite addicting the community is toxic. From egotistical killers to ignorant survivors this game has it all. I thoroughly enjoy the game when it isn't filled with campers and tunnelers I am a survivor main so that's what I see most of. But even though there is a pretty bad community the game is recommended in my book. There are glitches like anything and crashes but they're liveable. Definitely worth the $20.
1;Absolutly one of the most addictive games out there. Such a simple game yet so inutitive. However it could be considered a bit unbalanced at this point but devs are always working super hard to meet expectations and addresses issues quite rapidly. Even after a number of years it still feels like a fresh crsip game. I can only give this game my sincere recommendations!
1;Dead By Daylight have been updated too many times..This game was good but from some updates this game is getting badI love this concept of games but i think this game got destroyed with some updates..This game was fantastic but i prefer another games right now..I left dead by daylight community for 1 reason Getting ED UPI hope the old dbd is gonna come back &lt 3
1;Uhh all I have to say after playing this masterpiece.. is thank you developers for providing an experience like Dead by Daylight. Why hate on this game specifically I dunno I mean I know it has it's cons and a few hiccups but if you have the system to play it it's a really fun game.
1;This game is incredible. I have a computer that can play just about any game and I spend most of my gametime on this game. It's a very very very very addictive game once you get good at it... the updates are pretty constant and the developers seem to really care about the game and community. There are some toxic people but at the end of the day they're in every single game no matter what. This game is amazing and for only 20$ you'd be an idiot to not buy it. I promise you.
1;Product received for free. The game is very well made it has a unique concept that i really like. The best thing in this game is that you need to learn things and get used to them for being a good survivor. You need to learn jukes every update comes with new techniques every new perk every new killer that comes out changes the way to play and this makes it my favourite game.
1;Dear developers The game is awesome and based on a very creative and interesting concept and it was even better after you fixed the matchmaking. After the last patch or so I have to restart the game every time I want to play another match because I get stucked into an unlimited loading screen. Please fix this glitch it makes everyone willing to stop playing such a great game.
1;The Jason Game you've always wanted to play. fun as hell and makes you scream out like a 12 y old girl scout at a Justin Beiber concert. Survivor play through1. hide from killer2. start repairing generator.... 3. forgot to hit space bar... generator explodes Forced to hide.4. Oh god Oh god Oh god....... HE FOUND ME!!!!!!5. just when i think i get away he apears out of nowhere. 6. i get sacrificed to the spawn of the roaches....... 7. ready for next round
1;Great game i love it i'm so addicted to it tip for the people in survive with friends it happens very often that you wait hours its mostly cuz the region is unpopulated like The Netherlands try to change steam region to the USA or Russia in your steam settings and most of the time you're in very fast you don't have to restart steam even when it ask you to do it.
1;I'm in love with this game but it needs more bug fixing and other important things. After all it's a very good game and if you like this kind of games and you have a medium range pc i totally recommend you this game. ) Oh and I forgot to say what is killing this game...the fu***ng toxic community
1;Savage Jason inspired killer Competitive ranking system Selfish teammates Plenty of rage Join ranked games with friends Procedurally generated objective locations Teamwork Regular bugfixes/updates FeelsBadMan Savage meat hooks Bugs But hey it is good game buy it 9.5/10UPDATE 18/08/16Free DLC 10/10UPDATE 26/11/16Added less grindy leveling system
1;Absolutely bananas. What an amazing game. A little on the janky side but there are very few games that I can imagine that can halt my daily League of Legends addiction. I haven't played League in three weeks. So good. I look forward to them continuing to tweak and improve.
1;It has a really nice concept and the potential to be a really good game. At this time it's still buggy and has quite some issues but I still enjoy it nonethelessand I am expecting the developers to work out its shortcomings and technical issuesand deliver us a great game.I'd recommend it to fans of survival horror and especially to fans of slasher movies butnot to people who are expecting to play a finished and bug free game game at this time(Maybe after it comes out of Early Access).
1;Fun. Simple as that.HOWEVER. Survivors who make it their sole purpose to troll the killer kill this game. I've chased a single survivor who looped me over and over and over and spammed his little teabag crouch endlessly to tease me.KILLERS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE A TOY. THATS HOW THIS GAME FEELS.If there was ever a mode that disable perks entirely that would be all I ever played. Perks ruin this game.
1;1000+ hours in and i still find the game enjoyable the community has its bad eggs but for the most part a lot of people are cool and not rude the games got a grind to it which is what makes it the most fun it keeps you coming back i would 100% recommend this to a friend and i have )
1;This update is suck.Is not the killer strong enough?You have traps you can blink you can be Invisible you can use a chainsaw.The humans can only run.Then what?Just run and die?Then was the fun part of be a survivor?Are you guys forcing everyone to be the killer?Buffer the killer over and over again.Are you afraid of the survivors will sacrifice the killer?
1;Been playing this game for 1k hours and still playing will get kinda bored once in a blur moon but the dev will suprise u with something new time over time.Just buy it and enjoy the game! Not a very nice community pretty toxic. But what do you expect from the internet world.Recommended!
1;This game has kept me coming back because of all the new and exciting content that is released on a somewhat regular basis. Sure it has it's flaws but that's what makes me love this game even more. If you're open minded to change and love survival horror/slasher style games this game is for you.
1;Be a Survivor and try to escape a player controlled enemy that is a KillerYou have a variety of skills and survivors available to choose from and its a pretty fun survival game.Playing the Killer you have to kill all the players trying to escape and you have a wide variety of different killers to choose from and they are all Unique with their own abilities.
1;Haven't played in a while but the DbD grind is the only game that i can say doesnt feel like a grind for me its very unique and the playstyle is PvP and very linear so if you like linear PvP this game is for you (like call of duty multiplayer). ONLY UPDATED THIS FOR THE NONIMATIONS
1;It look like as it is always the same but every time you play it it is different. Another killer makes all the differences in the words of the G Man.Also their politics is good in my opinion some DLC are free some you have to pay for but you do not need them to have fun. Every Thursday the developers give a one hour view behind the development of the game features that will come and more. Very good.
1;Most balanced the game has ever been. The pros of the game are that it's fun lobbies are usually pretty fast and it's pretty unique. The cons are that the community is pretty toxic there's a fair bit of grinding for the good perks (however only 2 or 3 of the meta perks are on dlcs that you HAVE to pay for and even then there's always the shrine) Overall I've put over 500 hours into the game and I still enjoy it so there's no way I could not recommend it.
1;Here's what you have to look forward to in Dead By Daylight Teams that have no idea what they're doingKillers that camp youSurvivors that farm youSurvivors that teabagSalt in the after game lobby almost no matter what.Salt in game causing survivors to rage quit. Bugs that have been around since launchExtreme lagOverall 12/10 would camp again.
1;Dead By Daylight is a fun and enjoyable game. Although the game has repetitive objectives actions/perks taken and used throughout the trial will make each match different in how everything plays out. My only complaint is the fact that the game's developers didn't do an 'acceptable' job of optimizing the game overall. This can create a noticeable amount of lag/drop on framerates at times (even with the best gaming equipment) which might hinder your progress during gameplay as killer or survivor.
1;Great game! I absolutely love it it is incredibly entertaining. However if you have major problems with lag be warned. It is nearly impossible to play with lag due to quick time events. I also wish they had been more upfront about the fact that you have to buy packs to gain certain content. If I had known I would have spent the money I had left on the Hag rather than another game.
1;this game is great fot people who like very tense horror games. your always wondering where the killer is and where you'r teamates are. and if your playing as the killer you have an overall feel of power over the victims. but since the killer has a 1st person view and the survivors have a 3rd person view the survivors can usualy see the killer before the killer sees them.I highly recomend this game.
1;Dead By Daylight Is one of my all time recommends! This game brings the fun multiplayer horror stratedy based games to a whole another level! I love playing this game with my friends and I think others do to. If you haven't tried this game out you should definitely do so!
1;i finally got to murder my friends so its good in my book. game got a lot of potential jokes aside tho. add an alien or something as a killer. put predator in and give him heat based/movement based vision or some put frank west in as a survivor and give him a perk that can let him like football tackle the killer to stun them or something man. this games a goldmine for ideas really
1;Amazing game with an amazing idea for this type of genre. 1 of the 3 killers is extremely overpowered and should be nerded but in the end its an amazing game except for the fact that some of the items/killers in the game are overpowered and should be nerfed.
1;well devs i think it is the time to stop campers PERMANENTLY!!!! I am thinkng of a circle around the survivor that is hooked and if the circle stays in that circle for more than 20 seconds he will be forced to leave the game the circle must be outside of his heartbeat range so please try and add this into the game to stop campers by a very harsh punishment
1;11/10 IGN I play all the time.Edit For real this game is great once you get into it. You may feel like the killers are over powered or suvivors are depending on who you play. But playing both side take knowlege of what you should be doing. If you do pick it up make sure keep at and don't go rage on the forums or reddit it just adds to toxicity in the comunity.
1;The best multiplayer game in the horror genre ....u can play alone and survive on ur own or just make friends and be a team player.the graphics are better now compared to the earlier version.The only flaw of this game is the bugs e.g. disconnection from lobby and game otherwise its 10/10 from me...i fully recommend this game to anyone nomatter which genre u love so buy it without giving a second's thought whether its on sale or not.
1;Good game dont let the bad reviews get to you. Sure the game has flaws but they do not out weigh the good this game has to offer. Most of the bad reviews are from players who just suck at the game and blame the game for their mistakes. This game is definitely worth the money.
1;If you dont want to get addicted to a game DO NOT buy this game.Everything about this game is 10/10 except for a bug the happens every 30 mins MAX. You go into an infinite loading screen try to join lobby or game can get frustrating... but who cares the game good enough to ignore the fact theres a bug.
1;This game is Early Access so it has its issue's but the devs are working on them.Despite the flaws in the game I personally (and everyone I know who owns the game) love it.The negative reviews are people who find the broken portions of the game too immense to overcome but trust me ... They just don't understand the meaning of early access.This game rocks. Buy it.
1;"""I have and will always love Dead by Daylight. It's a game with full potential!!However I do have one specific complaint. Campers. I understand that camping could be a """"technique"""" but FACEcamping? Really? Perks that combat facecamping/general camping are getting debuffs and it really feels like the game favors the killers more than making it equal... Making it not as fun to play survivor."""
1;Truly worth it price is nothing game has ton of content at least enough to spend hundreds of hours having fun gameplay is awesome and you should buy it ) I'd say It's not for everyone but watch some gameplay and if you like that kind of game just go for it )
1;The devs have finially stepped up and fixed all the bugs and issues I have had before. Its really nice to be finially able to play this game. Even though I do feel like generators get done super quickly sometimes as killer and super slowly as survivor. Who would of thought?It has issues but it is exstremly fun.
1;15 hours in and it's pretty fun. Aysymetrical gameplay where the killer is overpowered due to there being 4 survivors (hes not actually op in a meta sense). In its current form I would suggest only buying this if you have friends to play private games with.
1;AMazing game 9/10 definetlythere is some bugs but it is definetly worth it The fact that I cant lobby with friends does kinda me off since i bought 2 friends the game developers if u read this plz implement that u can 4 man lobby only as surviors just so u can play with friends it isnt game breaking for randoms if u are only 4 survivors and this would extend your game life a load
1;Great game balance is as good as can be expected in a game made to be unbalanced. Most of the people who cry about it need to get gud whether they play killer or survivor. There is really no limit to the cheeky things you can do to trick your opponents.
1;THIS GAME IS AWESOMEI know this game has a lot of matchmaking problemsI think the devs are trying to fix all of thatWhen its in gameplay it's good and needs to fix some things and placesaveragely this game v. goodI RATE it 9 or 8 1/2 out of 10Rate 9/10
1;Ooohhhh this game is good u should download it right away buy it the game is simple just play As a survivor or As an killer killer tries to kill survivors As the survivors Try to escape and survivors Need to power upp 5generators and the Can open the gates to escape or at 2 gend Done a hatch spawns in u Need a key but If u are the last One alive it opena automatically
1;FIX THE DAMN HIT BOXESThe only main thing that annoys me on this game besides from all the campers is the hit boxes on the characters. They can swing at you and it would look like they miss by a few feet but some how they damage you. This can also happen if the killer is facing away from you and if they're behind a tree.
1;One of the best games ive played in a while easily as a survivor your heart starts racing as soon as the killer starts chasing you until you get away then its the best feeling ever !As the killer you reign terror on the poor 4 sobs trying to escape simple but not so simple at the same time is to kill them any means necessary!! 10/10 for me
1;Ridiculously addicting. Love it and love to hate it.IMO Killers shouldn t be allowed to camp Dedicated servers would help with really dumb lag moments and ridiculously hard to judge hitboxes. Survivors shouldn t be able to be hurt while vaulting You shouldn t vault back over a pallet when facing away from it. You shouldn t pull down a pallet and be pulled to the killers side of the pallet.A lot of fun regardless of issues.
1;Really playable now the devs keep improving it.After roughly 100 hours I can say that the game is in a really playable state now. Expect a few rough edges along the way but if you can look over this the game is really intense.One small problem though there is no real tutorial only videos they cover only the basics.
1;This is the first horror expierence that is fun and makes you jump at the same time. Hearing that heartbeat increase and thud louder as the killer gets closer really puts you on edge. For best immersion... Turn off the lights Kappa. Only problem with the game so far is no party up system for online play with friends. Other than that this game is great and a recommened buy.
1;Thrilling and challenging. It's very easy to get yourself caught if you're trying to do things too quickly so take it easy folks. Wait for a moment that you know you are truly safe or truly screwed to break into a sprint. Very few bugs in this game as far as actual gameplay but the menu can get a bit freaky sometimes. You can play with friends now! So that's pretty awesomeAll around a good game to get your heart pumping with only light medium rage induced from gameplay.
1;"""Dank By Deadlight is a wonderful game. If you like seeing the back of your teammates' heads as they run through the exit gate leaving you on a hook or particularly enjoy the words """"failed to join a game """" this could be the game for you. On a more serious note this game is extremely enjoyable especially with friends and the devs do a great job fixing bugs. I highly recommend this game for $19.99 even in its current state."""
1;Despite mixed attention this is a geniunly great game. The only issue is the community can be a bit toxic at times. Otherwise it's a lot of fun. Devs do tend to focus more on killer adjust and buffs without a doubt but it's just the game getting harder for people that have been playing for a while. Face camping is my only gripe that needs some sort of solution.
1;I said I would change this review if they fixed this issue and they did so I have. I absolutely love this game now that they've really worked to iron out a lot of bugs. They've also done a lot of work on balancing and the new killers and maps they've released have been superb. The spirit that was just released in the latest DLC is phenomenal and one of the scariest killers in the game yet. I hope they continue and the game thrives for many years to come.
1;Got this game back in 2016 and played off and on until recently the game is in a good spot right now and is hopefully only going to get better I'd definitely a pick up if its on sale and if you have the money to spend then it might be worth it at regular price. It takes awhile to learn the community is pretty toxic though.
1;It's a very exciting game. I don't like online matches but this game makes me motivate.However this game still has many bugs and poor balance. Sound is very important in this game but recent sounds are not heard due to recent patches. I think that this is disadvantageous in killer play. Anyway I think this game is worth playing.
1;Bought Dead By Daylight on release.The game itself is fun and exciting but the queue times get very long if you queue up with more then 2 people.Also facecamp killers are very annoying to play against but most killers luckily don't do that anymore.Apart from that i definitely recommend this game.
1;(I would recommend to anyone.) I have put soo many hours into this game i enjoy this game way to much. I have all the dlc bought for this game and i will get more when the chance occurs. there are a few gliches but its nothing to bad to the point to where its not playable would recommend 10/10
1;"""Pros Little horror more in nervous good for timid player Good balance between surviver and killer RNG skill tree system(? (not sure abt the name but its kinda new to me) FunCons Ping issue people disconnect when losing (actually this is not good for both killer and surviver) Rank system make surviver """"chooses"""" good teamate (So newbies is hard to find a good partner to learn)8/10"""
1;Really fun game even though it has a lot of bugs and balancing issues currently you might notice a lot of negative reviews if you look you will see that most of the negative reviews have hundreds if not thousands of hours on the game yet they are not recommending it who would play a game they dislike for a thousand hours? The game is worth the money and all of the chapters are also worth the money the game has problems but they are worth dealing with because the game is addicting.
1;This is a really good game. I agree that it has lags but that's because it's still in development. This game is a diamond in the rough. I can never get bored of it. The devs are updating it with many new survivors modes killers. So this is something to look forward to. When this game is completely developed it will be even more awesome than it already is. So I recommend it.
1;Great game but the DLC adding Michael Myers made the game annoying since 90% of the games you will find he is the killer and he is a bit overpowered so the game starts to get frustrating. There should be an option where you get to choose at least one killer you don't want to play with.
1;More fun than Evolve ever could have been while still keeping the aspect of one vs many while giving him extraordinary powers. The atmosphere and feel to the game is very fitting just play in a dark room with headphones on and you'll be hooked into either the serial killer or survivor experience.
1;Product received for free. I don't fully reccomend this game for everyone. If you can deal with the frustration of being a new player and having no way of getting around killers because of the lack of perks and eventually getting the ones you need to do well in this game then it is worth the purchase. This game is fun but can be frustrating.
1;nice game there are some connections problem especially if you don't do a little spam test in the lobby's chat but everything stops here. Every survivor complaining about lag should've done the test in the lobby so it's not the killer's fault. The game has some bugs in the past there were some game breaking bugs which are now all been fixed and the end of the day i really like the game and have I have a lot of fun with it.
1;DBD is an awesome semi horror game that requires skills and and plan to escape alive. I've played this game for about 80+ hours and I love it. THe only thing I have to say bad about it is the fact that you can be a 20 survivoir rank and go up against killers that are a 1 rank.
1;I'm not going to give the game a negative review due to the community as you've probably already heard the community is extremely toxic (my steam profile comments can back this up) the game is pretty unbalanced and can become very frustrating after many hours of play. Still though the game is pretty popular has mostly positive reviews and I keep coming back to it why? Because it's fun and that is why i'm giving it a positive review.
1;I love this gameIt's not perfect and there are plenty of irritations but when it's good Oh my God what a rush your heart is pounding and it's truly scary.Worth dealing with all the BS toxic players and salty DCs just for those few fun filled games.Most players are friendly in chat and there's a great streaming community.Not sure why all the DLC is so expensive though.
1;If the two sides of this game stoped trying to call out the other side for inbalance maybe the developers would be able to actually focus on creating new and fresh ideas for the game.But your right why would i want a non toxic dbd when i can t bag and flashlight spam like the real pros
1;The game is very good with friends if you are looking for a game to grind out on this is it. Both modes (Killer and Survivor) are very fun and keep you playing the game. Certain perks can change how you can play this game. Overall one of my favorite games in a while definetly reccomend!
1;Game is amazing. Devs are constantly trying to make it fair new content about every 3 months. The game is fun when being played how it is supposed to be played. Survive With Friends groups that get on discord do tend to ruin the experience for the killer and salty killers ruin fun for survivors but most of the games you play won't be like that. If you don't dwell too hard on the bad games you'll have fun especially if you enjoy asymmetrical games.
1;A great party multiplayer game good gameplay mechanics. I like the idea it is something new and fresh. Really intense gameplay experience. The game is not polished like other aaa games but for the price under 20 euros it is a good choice to try this slasher movie'' game.
1;Product received for free. Orginally wrote a bad review of this game due to some horrible connection issues. However it has greatly improved since it's early days.No more connetion problems.This game is fun was strangers and fantastic with friends. With all the abilities and perks of this game it can be quite a fun challenge. Keep it up devs.
1;A game that provides a unique kind of thrill. Very fun with friends although SWF is broken and takes forever to play with friends. devs are very funny and friendly but dont do to fix the game. They act like they work hard to develop what we ask for as a community. They dont care about what we have to say and are ignoring bugs. Although it is very unclear how to win in this game at the start.
1;This game is tons of fun but it can take some time to get the hang of. Playing survivor is where it's at if you want the thrilling experience of being in a horror movie. However playing killer isn't quite as fun because of some cheap and annoying tactics taken by survivors. Hopefully the game will be balanced better in the future.
1;This game is still fun as it is being updated. The devs are completely revamping the pip system as well as balancing out the killer with the survivors with the new incoming patch. I went away from the game for a bit but came back because it still holds a small place in my heart. Many killers and many survivors with different gameplay and perks available.
1;If you like eating wood I mean pallets. This is definitely the game for you. Not only are you constantly eating wood it also never runs out! Every 5 ft in a chase you will have a giant wooden piece of s h i t called a pallet thrown right onto you! What's better than that? Oh! There is something better! The survivor can jab you in the a s s and force you to drop them! The good kind of cancer. &lt 3
1;I really enjoy this game a lot. It's one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone. The balancing between killers and survivors are a little biased with survivors having a tad too much power but it doesn't deter me from playing as both. Really fun but some survivors are very toxic so you have to be careful about that otherwise a really fun experience. I also own this on PS4 but the PC version hands down is the best.
1;this is a very good game would definetly recomend but if youhave a slower computer you can still play it. if you buy the game and have some lag you can go to the settings and change the quality or select the opitoin forit to run at what is best for your computer that helped me out a lot
1;Do you like being heart pounding terror? How about deadly hide and seek? What about chasing teenagers around with a machete and laughing as they slowly bleed to death on the meat hook you hung them on? If you said yes to any of these questions then this game is for you! At this stage of development the game is absolutely worth the asking price. When all of the new features and content that is on its way is implemented $20 will be an absolute steal for Dead by Daylight.
1;Product received for free. The game is very fun with friends and sometimes by yourself but it has some bad balancing issues with survivors being way to strong if their at least decent at the game but if you can overlook that its a great game definitely worth a try.
1;Welcome to matchmaking simulator! but seriously super fun game a riot to play with friends if only you could find a game! payed full price for this game and don't regret it But I do have more patience then some maybe take up knitting during those long lobby waits?
1;Hi! I really enjoy playing this game it is suuuper fun! But I don't think the traps under the hooks are that fair for survivors. Considering the new update that made it harder for survivors to survive. But otherwise the game is awesome. But why can't I get the new/old killers? Like michael myers and the hag. I would love to play them but I can't. Do you like have to play the game while you get the killers? Oh and the survivors.
1;Very fun game. New content often some paid but some free. However it can be buggy and I hear a lot of people say that the community is very toxic though I haven't run into much toxicity myself.Definitely a good game for you if you like interesting multiplayer experiences with or without friends.
1;Dead By Daylight is the abusive boyfriend who after abusing you tells you that it was just a one time thing and he didn't mean it. You being the naive child that you are believe him. Then a few weeks later Dead by Daylight abuses you again and tells you the same thing. You want the relationship to work so you continue even though he's abusive.Jokes aside I ing hate this game. But I love it so. 10/10 would recommend.
1;Been playing since October of 17' and I absolutely love this game! Sure there have been ups and downs with balancing but all in all a fun experience! This game will get my heart racing literally lol! ( I main survivor) The community can be toxic at times but not a deal breaker for me. Dont sweat it some people cant handle thier $h!t or get mad for losing. I also Love how the Devs are always updating and adding new content. Really enjoying the new open Beta now too! I highly reccomend!
1;"""Great game to play with friends. Always keeps you on your toes but there are times where the game can be so called """"toxic"""" when a killer is camping a hook and making it very difficult to play the game and have fun and I do know that is a strategy to play the game. I rate the game a 10/10"""
1;One of my best games to play. At anytime there is something to do i find. Either playing killer when you really need to take out some steam or just be pychopathic. Or playing Survivor with your friends and have fun looping the killer around a palet. They have been fixed now ( . And the other game mode is when you have friends and you want to just kill them like you most likely do normaly. Trust me Get the game its worth it.
1;great game not at all what i expected it to be but i'm still very very pleaased with what i got. Would recommend to anyone for ong nights of getting on by a killer that will relentlessly hunt you down while you cower in a corner or fix generators to attemp to escape either way you'll have a ton of fun in the process.
1;This game is amazing in my opinion with the addition of Survive With Friends I can play and have fun with my friends (even though it took a while) it has made me want to play the game and have more fun while doing so. I do have to say my favourite part of the game is playing survivor even though i do love killer. I completely reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good spook once in a while.
1;having this game since day one to now really shows the progress the devs have made with this game. I for one enjoy the game but at times it can be dull do to how others play not fitting your style or just not wanting to play the game at the moment that doesnt mean however that its not a good game I think if you play the game for a bit you can really enjoy it but not all the time because then it feels repetitve
1;Progression bugged by a blackhole in the bloodweb on my trapper.... blocking me from taking an important perk... And at level 14 so i can't get 2 perks on. (not the entity eating the bloodweb)Couldnt find any fix on the forumsBut the game is amazing. PLS message me if you know a fix ty
1;It IS A GREAT GAME. My only problem is that you can either play with only friends or no friends at all. Also as of June 20 2016 the game still has some bugs. Obviously you have to let them slide because the game is so knew.Some of the bugs i get are All the bugs i wrote down are now fixed. im editing this two weeks later
1;This game is a good game. The only thing thats get on my nerve is when you help somebody and then you get caught and they just run and don't help you like WTF and It takes a long time getting to a game so if you want to find a game make sure you have something to do waiting for it. But overall its good.
1;Would be more fun if people didnt DC and screw you out of your bloodpoints and your level ups. Thats my only main issue it. Even when they DC they dont lose anything i know i DC'd once out of rage but now knowing it messes up people who want to level up. Thats the only thing that needs to be fixed other than that its awesome
1;Dead by Daylight is a very fun game based around either playing as a Killer to chase down Survivors or the Survivors running away from the Killer and attempting to activate generator to escape and keep whatever items they find. The gameplay can sometimes be annoying but I always find myself coming back to the game even after it has frustrated me. It's a very fun and very new experience for some people. It's an amazing title and I recommend you give it a try.
1;Completely Stupid Game The Killers That Were Added Are Too OP you guys really dont know how to make a killer where players could actually enjoy their selves with the constant BS of how these OP killers you tend to create make these tricks to make a game seem almost impossible The Hillbilly The Trapper The Raith The Lullaby Leatherface should have stayed as the only killers in the game this game to me is by many parts dead.
1;Ok so my opinion is that the idea of this game is briliant but still there are a lot of problems that break the joy of the game there comes the facecamping killer latency camping. I know the devs are saying this is one of the ways to play this game but still this is the lamest way to play this game as a killer. As I said this game could be so good with a bit more dedication .
1;Before i had a negative experience with this game (mostly because of bugs) and stopped playing it for like 6 months or more.But then after that i wanted to give it another try just to see if the game has improved. And on my first game already i could tell that a lot of things have changed (for the better obviously). That's why i changed my mind and instead of keeping my negative review i made a new positive one.PS There are still somethings to fix but i'm sure that they will be.
1;Well This Is Also A Bug You Could Fix Too But This Game Is Highly Recommended For People With Good Manner and Capability Of Not Getting Irritated.Bug With the menu I go to my bloodweb (With My Mouse) only to figure everytime I go to click it the whole screen jolts When I use controller to move in the menu it doesn't. So for now I decide to call it Controller Compatible For Menu's.Other Than That Good Game.
1;"""Great game. Love the concept. Hours of fun. Only downside for me is the connection bugs that probably shoulda been knocked out in Beta. (for example trying to join a game as a survivor and getting """"failed to join game"""" again and again and again and again. Also the random disconnects where the game says """"connection to steam lost"""" and closes the game on you in the middle of a match.)"""
1;"""I love this game! Currently you can't queue up with your friends in the ranked mode alongside randoms but there's recently been an announcement of a """"survive with friends"""" mode. In the same announcement weekly patches were mentioned so other cons such as bugs will probably be fixed."""
1;http //www.youtube.com/watch?v auEnZDKV0jkAs of right now I've put about 20+ hours into the game. The issues I currently have with the game are being addressed by the Dev's. Overall I think the game is really good and hopefully will have a bright future amidst the darkness.
1;"""I love Dead by Daylight and especially playing with friends. It is a great game you really get into the game. It feels great when youre intensly in the game and are getting loser and closer to escape to only be thrown under the bus by youre """"teamates"""". Quite a few ways to play the game fun and intense gameplay nothing too broken compared to other games"""
1;I only bought it 2 days ago and I'm already addicted. Although playing as the killer against 4 coordinated teammates (premades who talk on discord) is a terrible experience the game feels perfect in every other aspect to me so far. The bloodweb's design is unique and interesting there is a wide variety of characters so you can never get bored and so on.. Great game really
1;it's a very fun game with interesting and original concepts and mechanics. The only downside to the game is the matchmaking process which can sometimes seem like they only have 1 server running in the middle of nowhere. Overall very fun game and for 20 dollars it's very worth it
1;Dead by Daylight is a great game! Great gameplay can be really stressful sometimes. Lot of different maps different killers and surivors. The leveling system is really great it makes you want to play again just to get those bloodpoints lol.Some killers should be nerfed in my opinion but if you have good teamates and yet still manage to lose against those killers (hello Freddy) then it just means that you are bad.
1;Seeming as the devs are intent on actually fixing the issues this game has namely high rank d/cers and window cheesing I would totally reccomend this game. Them adding party queueing and other quality of life improvements are just icing on the really spooky and brutal cake. The candles are hooks.10/10 would take people to the dungeon again
1;For the price point this game is incredible. Geniunely interesting and fun gameplay in a asymmetrical way. The Killer player feels powerful when you play as him. The survivors do feel helpless and there's that aspect of teamwork vs. selfishness do you want to survive or risk death saving a team mate for a few more points. It works on many levels which Evolve simply didn't.If even a little bit curious pick this up it'll surprise you just how great it is. At this price point its a steal.
1;good game but finding a match in survive with friends is really annoying cuz whenever no matches is found u have to all ready up again instead of having the search keep working. sometimes ur lucky and find a game quickly but most of the time u have to wait like 5 10 mins and ready up a ton of times before u find a match. i would be willing to wait if i could just tab out and do something else instead of having to stay in the game to ready up again.
1;By far one of the best games I've played and it's so new! The best thing about it is I have constantly been looking for a slight horror game that is also multiplayer so that I can play it with friends and this has given more than any other game I could find. Looks great plays great other than occassional lag which I think is because of the host of each lobby and I find fun on playing both survivor and killer (except when killers just stand there and stare at you as you die). Overall 10/10
1;This game has both good and bad elements. I find Dead by daylight is boring to play by yourself but extremely fun to play with friends. My friend and I played together for 5 hours straight before he had to go. I tried to play by myself themnext day and couldn't even finish a game.
1;Although this game has it's bugs and a few connection issues. This game is great. I have had a great time playing with friends. I play killer when I play by myself and it is loads of fun. If you are on the brink of deciding whether or not to get it just get the game. It is lots of fun.
1;a cancerous toxic warzone of pleasure x3 its an amazing game and i literally want stop playing it i would 10/10 recommend( for starters i know it might be difficult to understand some stuff but trust me the more u play and learn the more it gets intresting and fun ) &lt 3)
1;I made a review about this in 2016 back in the early days of the game and it has come a long way from what it used to be. The matchmaking no longer takes ages to find players. A lot of bugs have been fixed. Overall the experience is a hell of a lot smoother than in 2016.
1;Hey guys. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game.I played nearly 200 hours since it was released. My friend introduced me this game and I introduced to other friends and we're all having fun. i understand there are issues however the devs are listening to players and they're fixing bugs and im happy about that.this game has potential and i cant wait for more maps and new characters.
1;This game is awesome. Being able to survive with friends or kill your friends the game has an addictive leveling and ranking system with a mix of horror that makes it a game you can play for hours on end. I would reccomend that you buy it with friends however unless you are just looking to be a killer because surviving without friends can be boring but its a good way to get online friends.
1;I like and dislike this game its so much fun with friends and when you have a good team but when you have lag (game works on P2P killer is host) and play with new players who don't know what they are doing you just want to quit but I just love playing so yeah its a good game
1;I totally recommend this game started with a few bugs but nearly all were fixed last patch. A great survival game. This game is hugely growing up on players. So as i expected. 100% Should be bought. If you don't like survival type of games give this game a try and your idea will change instantly. Its just amazing. Have fun on the game if you don't like it give the game another chance and play it again. You will like it for sure.
1;The game is starting to be really pay 2 win... first Mike that oneshots almost everyone and now some swampy thingy... i know that devs got to make money on that but it could be less op... thats what im thinking now..When i dont look at that fact i wrote up and on some ingame bugs... its really cool game but as i said be4 its so much pay 2 win... even to me (Im Hearthstone player)..
1;Overall this game is one of the best deals going on steam. It is addictive entertaining and efficient. There have been some issues since the release however devs continue to improve and make it an improving experience.My only real complaint is the grinding required to get the good perks. Once you have them it is enjoyable every game against skill of the same level. If you like multiplayer horror experiences then I don't think there is anything better.
1;really fun game however when the hosts is always the killer there serious problems with this. Have a connection so that way at least 1 2 people disconnect(surviors). free win for killer. and no partying up with friends becasue there is no option. 2 big things that need fixing.
1;Pretty good game.Balancing is all over the place and tons of glitches the devs could fix if they weren't on vacation all the time.Full of adrenaline rushing parts when the killer is after you or if the survivors are on the verge of escape.Lots of diversity in the loadouts and many different killers to play as to mix it up.7.5/10 good game but needs some fixes
1;This game is so fun! I've never played anything even close to it before and for the money it's incredible. If you're between this and Friday the 13th you cn't really go wrong but this game offers a little more to work for. Plus as someone who prefers to play as the killer I appreciate the ability to solely play that way if I want. I recommend watching some streamers play it before you start grinding it'll help a ton. 10/10.
1;Come onnnnn you know this is a good game right? You as the developers know that this is great so please fix the servers and help me get INTO a game with a full 4 team...why can we get a game faster with 2 people then with 4...just get me a killer to kill me and my friends. please.
1;Absoloutley fantastic game the devs truly care about players input and try their very best to put out relevant and wanted updates/content.Any bugs are fixed quickly ) I've played this game more than any other game I've owned in 20 years.Which..says a lot.
1;Its a very good game but they really like to add op killers lately #NerfKrueger (they nerfed him already but he s still op) but game is a lot strategic and you really need to know some good tactics for both killer and survivor. Very good game overall. 8/10
1;More of a PSA then a review. It's just not fun for newbies unless you play with friends I think. There's not a fair matchmaking system in place currently. I'd have 5 15 hours on this game and I'd get matched up with survivors who had hundreds of hours on the game. Most games are like this. I couldn't take it anymore and I uninstalled. I definitely regret the purchase. P.S. the community is very toxic. It's nothing like what you see on streams.
1;I highly recommend this game including if you have friends to play with. It really makes you choose decisions. For example i was hiding in bushes from the killer but he got one of my friends who was on a hook. The exit opened and i was next to it so i had the choice to leave and win or to leave my friend for death. Its a really fun game and is well worth the money get it asap!
1;I like this game but it is buggy. It is fun to play as survivor but there is to many camping or killers and killers are boring after a while but you get the most points if you dont camp.Servers are hit or miss if your trying to play with friends you can forget about it.So i recommend this game but wait till all the bugs are fixed.
1;Dead By Daylight has it's ups and downs like any other game.The ups The game is fun you make a lot of new friends playing there's interesting contentThe downs A few glitches camping killers jerk killers tooMostly the ups out weigh the downs for me and I would reccoment this game.
1;Survivor its a wonderful time of the year everyone has lots of funKiller you mean they kill each otherSurvivor no no they are funKiller Killing people are fun I like killing peopleSurvivor and you give each other a presentKiller and when you opened them they explode Survivor no! they are nice giftsKiller nice doesn't like much fun to me
1;Awesome game but recently its been very hard to get into games. wether its taking 5 minutes or its saying i have no network connection. Killers face camp to much and playing killer is almost impossible without camping which is annoying for both parties.
1;Product received for free. This game is very good. for now is my fevorite game. .is fun but not so much scary like i was thinking. in the game most pepole help other pepole( .but there is only one problome. to much time to find a server... i was give the game 9/10 tanks for keep fix problom for as D &lt 3
1;"""Had me """"hooked"""" from day 1. I have been on the search for a survival game that grabs my interest and I think this one is lovely. Love all the characters and players. You run into a couple toxic people like any game but the good ones are still there and make it worth it after a game goes your way or not. Can't wait to see what come with this new build as the PTB was great."""
1;Great game I recommend playing the game with friends not alone. One bad thing about this game is its locked at 60FPS. I have a GPU Asus 970 Intel Core i7 7700k 4.2ghz and 16gb of ram and i have to play on low settings. If anyone can give me idea's on how to fix this. Pls lmk
1;Great game every game is different. You can to play as a team on survivor side or lose alone if you worked alone on the survivor side. Killer is fun for early game farming. Cons Takes almost forever to match make as survivor where playing as the killer takes like 20 seconds.Dev needs to look into enticing more rewards for the killers
1;The game is really fun I just started playing it.But the thing is waiting for a game takes way longer than actually playing a game.And I think every patch the game breaks even more.There would be infinite loading screens disconnections and constant crashes.It literally depends on luck whether you get into a game or not.Without these issues the game would have been my favourite game I ever played.But I think the idea of the game is very recommended if you like horror games
1;This game is awesome and can be very hard sometimes. The player base is very salty sometimes but.... it's ok sometimes when the killer bashes your head in the first minute in the match it's understandable ))It has some bugs here and there but the very annoying ones are gone now (at least this is how I see it).
1;Product received for free. Wont' t play it anymore until the loopholes of 'getting disconnected deliberately' is solved. These few days I couldn't find a match without deliberate disconnection just for not being downgrading ones level. The problem has to be fixed
1;i love this game but it crashes every day many times out of all my games this is the only one that crashes.i have a 4770 i7 cpu and a gtx 970 gpu and 8 gb of mem.its not a beast of a pc but its not garbage either.so please fix what evewr is wrong with the game
1;Two of us are left the trapper has hooked the other survivor and I know where the trap door is. Guilt overwhelms me and I go to save poor Dwight. Get him off the hook get hit teammate abandons me I get hooked and he camps the trap door.10/10 would be a martyr again.
1;If your thinking about buying this game... DO IT!!! Even thought there are things that need to be improved &amp fixed the devs are working hard &amp listening to the community to improve the game. I normally never review games because it's not worth repping them but this game is a ing blast! I Strongly recommend this game! You'll get great moments filled with action adrenaline and laughter!
1;Despite its faults it is still a fun game. Played as killer main when all your hooks would get sabo'd and infinites were a thing still managed to hold rank 1. Quit for quite a while because of the toxicity and the bugs. Came back and had way more fun when I stopped caring about ranks and being super competetive.
1;i ask myself why i keep coming back to this gamei ask myself why its fun to hold M1 for half a gamei ask myself why i play a game and complain about it a loti ask myself if nurse is truly broken and should be deletedi ask myself why i hate camping killers but proceed to loopthese will never be answeredbut the game is fun i guess
1;"""Worth a buy no doubt. Amazing balanced competetiv game with great community and devs doing there best to keep the game going. Sure there are bugs and unfriendly players but which comp game doesn't have them?! Devs doing there best to get rid of the bugs and the rewarding parts for those players.Game is getting better and better.""""Pretty good job so far"""""""
1;Product received for free. soooo good i just love killing my friends lolbut for real....i love this game it is so fun with 1or 4 frends and being the killer is fun as well. The only thing that is cheep thing in the game is when the killer is mike miers. You need spine chill tear 2 to stay alive when he is being use but i would give this game a 10/10 even if im playing with mike miers becouse it could be a good challangeover all the game should be a 11/10
1;Sorry guys ...... I am not playing this game again untill the Campers are gone !!! This is so anoying you got no chance too survive anymore becaus there are only freacking Campers and tunnlers !!! PLEASE END THIS DEV S PLEASE END ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS !!! 12.06.2018The Game survived the new patch is out evrything is good again finally !
1;Pros The idea of the game is good.Cons Many many bugs.EDIT 20 January 2017 you can't even join a lobby.EDIT2 28 January 2017 now you can join lobbies but every killer facecamps you.EDIT3 13 February 2017 best update ever game runs very smooth now good job devs.
1;This game made me poop myself the first time i played it... after that i just realized i wasnt actually playing the game but i looked at my mom. The game itself is a cat and mouse game which can be fun in the right company but it mostly sucks wanger tangs.
1;Aboslutely love Dead by Daylight! It's super easy to get addicted to this game and no matter how many times I play I still feel the tension and thrill that comes with it being a horror game. There's a lot of people playing this game and it's community is great for the most part and it just keeps growing. Nothing about this game isn't fun. Highly recommend.
1;Rewrote my old negative review considering the work the devs have started putting into fixing the games issues.The new player experience and balance in some areas is still pretty bad but overall the game is worth it now. You can get quite bit of game time out of it.
1;Is the game fun solo? Certainly.Is the game 2spooky4me? Probably not it loses its 'horror' after about 20 hours.Playing with friends? Hilarious fun and shenanigans.Is it worth $20? Without a doubt.Should I avoid the forums? If you value your sanity.Quite a steal at $20 and if you can get a friend to play it with you...you're in for a good ride with its ups and down. If you can get four others to play it with you then you're in for a crazy time.
1;I very much enjoy this game personally I would say this is the best game i've evr played I really love the artwork and the perspective these characters have it runs verry smooshly for me Yes i would recommend this game for any and all gemers and even the horror fans out there Good job to everyone taking a part in creating Dead By Daylight props to you guys )
1;One of my most favourite games i have on steam i love making the killer annoyed if i am survivor but the better feeling is making survivors angry because they all seem to think theyre above everyone for some reason they are easier to play and you are probably gunna have a lot more fun at first playing as survivor. put the time and effort into being a good killer though and it gives you 10x the joy. oh and welcome to one of the most toxic communities in steam ) have fun in the fog &lt 3
1;promotes graverobbingOkay but seriously This is one hellova game and you should buy it. Sure there are some bugs that need fixing and toxic players that either A have no respect or B Will bully you 'till you break. No seriously you really need to avoid some parts of this game's community. Those people involve s...LOTS OF THEM...
1;To be honest this game will make your life depressed if you decide to play killer you will want to suicide you would go to a shop and buy a rope then try to hang your self becuase of this game it's so balanced pallet loops infinite loops t baggers flashlights bugs gen rushing. As a surivvor i would recommend it to you if you are ing toxic that wants to make people suicide and annoy them. Killer 0/10Survivor 11/10btw devs FIX UR ING GAME.
1;Wonderful game beautiful concept. Like all types of games it could use some improvements. Personally I will get a few hundred hours in perhaps more. You never really know what you'll get from your team and/or killer allowing it create a great variety of possibilities.
1;Product received for free. It was pretty fun. I think it is more fun with friends that have your back though. The only problem I have is that sometimes when I try to exit the game it doesn't let me. Also the loading screen can last for 30 minutes without picking up a game but other than that the game is super fun!
1;With BHVR purchasing the rights to the game and the most recent iniative to balance the game I do have to say that they've done a very good job at fixing many of the issues for both sides. There is still a long way to go but right now the future is looking far brighter. For that I have to change my score.
1;Beware. It is dangerously addictive. I have uninstalled this game three times but I always come back. Expect constant balanced unbalance and toxicitiy among the higher ranks. There's plenty of low skill people in the high ranks because they camp and tunnel. Can be rewarding if you get good.
1;The game is kind of frustrating in its current state. But im still giving it a good review. Because all the recent negatives you will see are from peopel who are angry because the game is actually becoming balanced for once. The game is very fun and the devs are making steps in the right direction to a better game. Despite all the negative reviews you see just ignore them. They actuall ymean nothing. half of them have like only 100 hours or so. Give the game a try its very fun
1;I love this game its a great idea and most of the time is fun to play. But there is SO many laggy games which is almost impossible to survive on and i just get really mad when i loot a chest and its a toolbox but it ALSO happens to be on the most laggy server on earth and there is no chance of surviveing..... if the Dev's buys servers it will fix A LOT of people's problems with this game but other then that it is a really good game.
1;After a lot of bugfixing over the course of the last two years which was absolutely necessary it became a pretty fine game.With all the new features that got added (not only through DLCs) it also stayed interesting the whole time.Its a great game to play together with friends and its not too hardware hungry eighter.
1;A lot of simulators built into one game Waking Up Your Entire Neighborhood Simulator Screaming Simulator Sweat Simulator Game Bugs Simulator Toxic Simulator Disconnecting Simulator Lag/Lag Switch Simulator Leaving Your Teammates for Dead Simulator Ragequit Simulator Pallet Looping Simulator Flashlight Simulator Salt Simulator Focus/Tunneling Simulator Camping Simulator Body Block Simulator Reporting Simulator BM Simulator Crying Simulator Rage Simulator Skill Check Simulator
1;"""It's crazy fun but plagued by the people who play the game in a really """"unfun"""" way. There's campers """"infinite"""" abusers and others with just bad manners but the pure adrenaline that I get from this game outweighs the frustration with the other parts. You will run into the some crazy glitches every now and again but I would still recommend getting this game.The developers are very receptive to the community on reddit and the steam forums here which may be both a blessing and a curse."""
1;A very fun game pretty straight forward killers kill and survivors survive.There are a few players using cheap tactics like camping on hanging survivors but you can find fun games most times.There isn't a great deal of content to justify a 15 price tag but it is still an enjoyable game.
1;The game now is so worth buying as it is now so fun. The wait time is very short and i dont need to mock my location just to find a match anymore. Which makes it great as now its better than friday the 13th. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to play a game for a long time and enjoys horror.
1;This game is simple and easy to learn but offers great replayability. This is the 4v1 game done right. It has great atmosphere and will cause nightmares when played after dark. It still has a bunch of bugs but most of them seem to be due to connectivity issues. The Devs are very active and listen to the players. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
1;very fun i enjoy playing this alot can't wait till the fix killer dodgers and the que botton for survive with friends so i can acually play with my friends without haveing to spend 20 30 mins looking for a game has a few bugs but is really worth the money would recomend this game to people
1;"""Honestly the only hiccup in this game for me is not matchmaking with THE BEST teammates. Playing as survivor or killer I have to say this is an awesome experience. I didn't get the chance to play until the free weekend and let me say """"Instant Buy"""" After about an hour of gamaplay I knew I'd found something great. I don't have a solid friend's list and so matchmaking wasn't exactly to my liing but even so I have loced every second of gameplay."""
1;Love the game. Well developed much more balanced than others I have tried playing. You can have a game with all survivors losing or one where the survivors make a fool of the killer with sometimes an even game of one or two gone. The dlc that s been released has all been good. The team has done well to fix errors and continue trying to make a good game.
1;"""Great game. r8 8/8 m8Pre edit """"Doesn't support """"Co op Multiplayer""""/a lobby system for multiplayer / Otherwise Great game 20 hours of gametime laterI've spend just over 60% of my game time on this game trying to find my friend in online lobbies.. I would rate this game VERY highly because of it's great mechanics and awesome gameplay. But this lobby system is absolutely terrible(and that's without me even mentioning the """"Failed to join a game"""" crap that occurs every friken time..)."""""""
1;This game is really good sure it has some bugs in it but what games dosen't there are two types of people in the Dead By Daylight community there are the chill/cool ones and there are the ones with a high level of sodium chloride and feel like they should win every time if you ever meet these type of ppl and you will ignore them
1;EDIT Since patch 1.4.0 the lobby issues seem to be resolved so I can now recommend this game.This is a great game! One of the most addictive and enjoyable multiplayer games I've played in years. The music / audio is outstanding and the game still gives me chills at certain moments even after 150+ hours of gameplay.
1;This game has helped me put my life back on track.In the time spent waiting for my last game I Cleaned the house Got in touch with family Went to college Got a decent job Found a wife Had 2 kids Retired in Florida DiedOnly to have the guy I'm finally matched with Queue dodgeGreat game for procrastinators 11/10
1;Good game like very good but it need some fix at bugs and with the players that camp.But sometimes you will get angry and rage quit bcs tunnel and camp bcs i found a player that camped me with 2000 hrs but what i can you you decide how to play but please dev team fix the bugs the toxic players and stop adding dlc for nothing and ban good players
1;I love this game. It's great for streaming and great to play either with friends or solo. The only thing I would change would be to be able to deny someone from taking you down off the hook. Most randoms will take you down in front of the killer for points and it makes me livid. QUIT IT. Otherwise never had any issues with the game. Oh except when the game doesn't load and returns you to the main screen and it takes your offering anyway. Rude.
1;real good game. got to make it out alive or be the killer it's fun both ways but be careful some times when you go to save pepole you get put on the hook and the guy you save will not come for you. challenging both ways. starting the genorators is challenging i love the game hope you do to
1;I LOVE this game sure the devs have stuff to fix but doesnt EVERY dev team have stuff to fix? This game at it's base it incredibly challenging both as the killer and survivor and it's incredibly rewarding to win AND lose (barring the occasional facecamping killer or infinite abusing survivor both of which are being work on by the devs).This is one game that I can play a mtch over and over and over and still have fun for hours and days.
1;UPDATE 10/16/17Game is a lot smoother now and a lot of fun.______________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW Good and fun game but it's glitchy as F**K. Constantly disconnects me and my group of friends. Half of the time we give up because we can't get a game started.
1;Game is epic Every match is fun and interesting to play Early on u have to endure salty survivors and their jukes but u get used to it laterThe game would have been much better if they add features like viewing ur recent matches like replays hence 9/10
1;The game is a lot of fun. The devs are pretty cool too and are definitely committed to fixing issues as they come up. Admittedly it's feeling a bit grindy now after all the time I've put into it but you can't say I didn't get value for money! And with how addictive it is I'll be back in a few weeks for another hundred odd hours.
1;Yes it is a fun game BUT SINCE THE GAME RELEASED FINDING A LOBBY WITH 2 OR MORE PEOPLE TAKES 40 ABOVE TRIES TO FINALLY JOIN THE GAME??? YEH I DONT THINK I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS GAME WITH THE UP COMING DLCS IF THIS ISSUE DOESNT GET FIXED. ALSO SO MANY BUGS!
1;I've really enjoyed playing Dead By Daylight. Its really fun. There are problems with balance and the Meta perks are ridiculous for both survivor and killer. But every game feels different and plays different. I just choose not to use Meta perks and use just random perks to see what I can come up with. Its a really fun game. Give it a try when its on sale for sure.
1;Even if the last patch right before the free week end was a bad idea and added some annoying bugs they released 4 hotfix within the 48 hours of the patch to fix it.To talk about the game it's really funny especially with friends for a spooky night )Totally recommend it! (and the price is pretty correct for the amount of content and replayability)
1;Even with the bugs that come with the game and some (by personal opinion) current progession system tatics that need to be changed the game itself is fun very arcade like and should give you mutiple hours of enjoyment with or without the DLC purchaces.
1;"""Dead by Bugs is pretty fun ig. not a horror game like at all. its more funny than anything. definetly worth the $20 though being that you can play it for hours and not get tired of it. if you hack dont expect to ever get your account back since the devs are anal about that stuff. overall a fun game. the devs """"did a pretty good job"""" )"""
1;I definetly reccomend this game it's alot of fun to play eventhough there are also some toxic people in it but that's always in every game so you can't really avoid toxic people. Like i said though the game is very fun to play especially with friends.
1;I really love this game ! It has a great concept and it's very easy to get addicted too. If you can by pass small glitches then you should get this game. The only problem I have is some players are very toxic I often play with friends to avoid the toxicity. Other then those minor things it's a very fun and addicting game !
1;This has always been one of my favorites. I had it on the Xbox before I made the switch to PC. Got this game because a bunch of friends play it. I can legit sit here and play for hours on end. I highly recommend this game. Its fun engaging and always has me on my seat because its a little spooky. Especially when I go against The Hag.
1;This is a game that is continually supported by the developers. They truly listen to player feedback and attempt to constantly improve the overall experience. Is every change spot on every time? No. However not every player will be satisfied with every single addition or tweak to the game. New characters and content are always being added and it is the one game that I have kept coming back to after so long.
1;Decent game. Long grind. They are finally balancing out the game and everyone is throwing a fit. I might start playing a game if they do a full balance (including DS and Selfcare). Let's just hope the devs keep going in this direction and don't pull another Freddy.
1;I personally really like the game. Many bugs fixed since I have started playing in December. Need to fix the survive with friend s lobby. Concept is incredible and they keep balancing killers/survivors. Some salty game play but good players figure out how to counter. I bought this game for 4 other ppl and we all enjoy it.
1;This is a great and fun game and my favorite thing is being the survivor with the intense music going on while running for your life!!! If you want even more fun buy the DLC's you get new killers and survivors but overall this is a really amazing game
1;Pros It's a really fun game. It allows you to search games with your friends now (Thank god) They certainly do not matchmake you with a rank 1 when all of you are rank 20 (I suppose?) Cons The matchmaking still takes quite long especially when you're a full party of 4 people searching the game (I hope the devs fix this issue soon!) The server is really laggy sometimes (So until then I suppose it's a Natural for me /
1;Product received for free. This game is being plagued by campers. 9 times outta 10 when you get hooked the killer just stands there or runs around the hook taking the fun out of it by not giving the players a chance to really do anything. something needs to be done about it cause its a great game that shouldnt be ruined by unfair players.
1;I played this game in early release for around 80 hours but got too frustrated with the bugs. I picked it up again about two weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to find queueing for survive with friends and in game bugs had been mostly fixed (at least the really glaring ones). I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes horror/survival games and doing it with friends.
1;Not a perfect game by any means. But it is one that has routinely gotten better as time has gone on and one that I always come back to.The developers have made some notable errors *cough* Freddy nerf *cough* but do seem to eventually figure out what to do if this most recent patch is any proof.Great game to play with friends great game for sacrificing Dwights to the entity.8/10
1;Currently the best Asymmetric Horror game. It still has issues relating to balance but the good news is that the devs are listening and are finally starting to right the ship The community is very divided. A lot of toxicity mostly from Survivor mains. But if you can get past rage messages in post game chat rage invites and in game tea bagging then it can be a very fun game.
1;DbD is my fovorite game on steam. that is that. I have 135 hrs on the game and i love it! the game does have things that r always ed about like jungle gyms camping and infinates but will the community really fully love any game? Dbd is amazing and the fact that the devs r working on the game to make it even better is awesome! keep doing what u do and make the game as balanced as possible! #MAKEWRAITHGREATAGAIN!
1;"""You don t like people? You wanna chase em down in Hill s have eyes Chainsaw massacre Resident Evil style? Or maybe you want to show your surviving skills?Then this game is right up your way!Flawed? Yes maybe a little with lobby waiting and no """"proper"""" matchmaking but still the gameplay makes up for it more then well if you like feeling your blood and heart throb through your chest and veins...Unless your getting hooked then it s pouring down your body..."""
1;Very fun game and a high skill ceiling. Even better with friends and just a great game all around. Do some research before you play and find a killer you would love to play or a survivor with the best starting perks you like. That's when you realize how fun this game is and learn all the charcters by the end. Fantastic game.
1;becouse its a good game and so many panic and thats so funny when you play with friends not just when you play with friends all time as a survivor as a killer is nice when you play with friends and you see your friend and hit him se says like AAAAAAA!!! and its funny but its not funny the campers
1;This game is great very fun to play. The sad thing is that there are tons of bug and for some reason the devs don't focus on the important stuff like the networking. It's very disturbing that they added a DLC character which I will not buy untill they fix the game.
1;I originally gave this game a bad review but after a few patches i realized the amount of work that the devs put in to satisfy the community and i'm happy to say i'll by playing and supporting the game thanks to the devs great work of course there are still things in the game that i wish were in the game and other things that i wish were not but the devs are definitely dedicated to well being of the game and i can respect that.
1;Excellent game very intense and the procedural generation makes the game feel new enough and different that it doesn't get stale fast. As the devs add more maps killers and survivors the game will only get better.Of course at the moment there are some bugs but in my opinion the good far outweighs the bad here. Game well worth the full price of $20.
1;i don't really have a recomadation for this game because it has broken mechanics and just buggy bad community which is also ruining the game and etc but it is super fun and very orignal have about 300+hours and sometimes it is funny i recomand it but if you can't deal with salt and stuff bugs and mechanics i wouldn't get it
1;Product received for free. So im still kinda new 20hrs or so but its a very fun game much more than I originally thought it would be. Suvivor aspect is by far my favorite but the killer side gives a neat switch up of the game I'd definately recommend to anyone who like campy horror movies or thriller survival games
1;Firstly I want to say that this is an amazing game. I have over 600 hours and It's something that I come back to day after day. I can't seem to get enough of it lmao. The game has it's obvious flaws with bugs hackers lobby issues but the gameplay is there. If you can over come those flaws then you'll love the game. I whole hearted believe this game has amazing potential with all its new content and community. Keep up the amazing game DBD! 10/10
1;As survivor Run for your life simulatorAs killer rage at survivors in end game chat Pros Kill your friendsCons really ing frustratingOverall actually a really fun game. Can be annoying as hell some of the time but generally a lot of fun. Takes time to learn how to track survivors around the map and to hide from the killer. Not an easy game to pick up right away.
1;"""Product received for free. Dead by Daylight is a very tactical game that great to play with friends or solo. It makes you take decision that would make for a wining end or a horrible dead. The question you should ask your self ones you start is """" Are you willing to risk your self for the sake of another surviver?"""" You will feel the pain of every decision you make..."""
1;"""Survivor is overpowered and they have become cocky arrogant and entitled because of it. If you go into this and do well as a killer or do 1 underhanded tactice while they do several you WILL get comments and you WILL be """"called out"""" on it. Its really funny watching survivors cry about you being better than them though. Fun game to get salty comments from survivors but really frustrating when they are obnoxious."""
1;Great game IDEA and POTENTIAL.I really think the dev's should have kept it under lock and key for at least another month (kept it in EA) before releasing it due to the unfinished feel of the game.However in saying this if you enter a game where you have 4 competent survivors and a very competent killer the game can be very entertaining and really makes your heart race.
1;the games amazing it runs great. it looks great and what ever i play as i have fun but its unfair when you use an offering and the killer disconnects so i lose it right at the start of the game. and theres also no were to report if you suspect someone of cheating other then that the games amazing.
1;I would recommend this game. Its fun playing alone or with friends. What I dislike about is the queue system and the killer being as a host. The killer gives so much lag to the survivors and its very annoying and makes you want to quit. Theres also lot of bugs needs to be fixed but still its worth buying it.
1;This is my favorite game at the moment. This game is just one of the best multiplayer horror games out there. The fanbase is a bit split on this opinion but i have to say its better than friday the 13th. Sure there are lots of bugs but those just make them better (at certain times). And there are licensed killers so if youre a fan of horror movies then this is a game for you.
1;So Dead By Daylight. Is fun really like the concept but has a lot of issues. New players really don't notice it just happy to play the game. Put a good amount of hours into it and one starts to see that killers are kinda underpowered. Still a lot of fun.
1;This game gives me arthritis when i have to spam click so i dont die when i am hooked. This game also has scum killers that hunt you down when you are hit once like i have there mothers nudes on my phone and about to post it. This game also has kids that have nothing better to do so they play killer and then leave the game instantly making me derank
1;i mean its ok its fun at some games but it gets unfair and salty and just just no.but i mean play it with friends and its pretty fun and SOME online games are also fun but one side (killer or survivors) will be unfair unless its one of THOSE games which i mean idk.
1;Pros +Many waifus (Fen Ming Nea the Huntress.... the Nurse...)+Really fun game+You feel the adrenaline when the hook is near you and there's a Myers in Evil Within 1 in the match+Nice gameplayCons +Pay to win (as killer)+Lots of campers+Myers is op (same as first point)Extra notes +Fen Ming is asian+Claudette is invisible+Dwight is always in the locker+Myers Freddy Bubba The Doctor and the Wraith are OP+Laurie es T H I C C+Ranks are reseted every 13thRecommended? yes... oh yeah
1;I had a problem with losing lots of game progress and it took awhile to get it fixed but the moderators did reconcile the problem after a few months. I still feel it is a little long for a fix but this is a great game and one of my favorite games in recent times.
1;It is very good game but it needs a chat to communicate with the survivors for example to tell them to go to repair the generators that I am in charge of saving survivors. Or something like that.I think that is the only thing that the game needs as it receives updates survivors and new murderers etc
1;All of my games have seemed fair in this generator simulator 3.0. When playing with my friends this game is especially fun but could end up monotonous with long runs of playing. However the killers usually make such a difference in a lot of games that it makes it different and enjoyable to play.
1;Ok I think its high time I gave this a thumbs up. The dev team has really stayed on top of updates and major bug fixes. the game play is fun the concept is cool. some of the major bugs were killing me but I have had a long period of just fun play. I recommend this game
1;Please do not read any reviews after 7/14/18. These reviews tend to be from salty baby survivors who doesn't know what asymetrical balance means. Dead By Daylight is an awesome game that can be tremendously fun but sometimes stressful. However DBD has been getting better with each update since 2018. The game will be played the way it should be played.
1;Sometimes it will make you sad sometimes it will make you mad. But sometimes you will flashlight save and tea bag the killer at the exit gates and everything is amazing and you thank all the gods you were born. Killers who respect the kobe or give you the hatch i will always love you!! I will never get tired of this game even with all it's t and wannabe Toxic children.
1;A great and fun game but PLEASE do not call every Killer a Camper if you don't know what you are talking about. If he is a Camper it will be the easiest round you have ever played. If you have lost then he eather is not a camper or you are really bad. The only way to lose against a camper is going afk because you could escape before the first guy is dead.
1;Game is great just needs some things fixed. Devs are working to make updates that help the game grow but they tend to ignore some of it's bigger flaws such as infinite abuse DDOS attempts and bugs that have been around since day 1. Overall a fun game.
1;If you like to have your heart race every time you play this is the game for you.Very intense gameplay innovative leveling up system amazing lore. The survivors are charming and the killers captivating. Great atmosphere and music.I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GAME! Definitely worth your money.
1;Product received for free. This game is really nice to play with friends but randoms still are good. This game pretended to be one of the best horror multiplayer games on steam. Community is good but you can find there campers and tunnelers ( Trying to kill one survivor and don't let him survive).
1;One of the most horrifying and extreme games I've ever played. All of the maps has their own difficulties and different game style and the graphic quality is amazing. I must admit that the game is hard to play but maybe the secret formula that made this game amazing was that. I highly reccomend playing online with your friends.
1;I love this game because I can kill people without regret. &gt ) JK dont call the copsBut its great fun playing as survivour too. Though if theres a camping killer just be super nice to fellow survivors try and save them as a group though you might lose its much more fun to try than to leave your team for dead.Overall I reccomend this fabulous game. And Happy Killing(Or surviving) I suppose )
1;Within the genre there is not many other games at the level of this one. Has already some time and with that some bugs are fixed and a lot of content is available (free DLCs or paid DLCs). As the price goes I think it is an okay purchase for a good time before it gets repetitive.
1;"""Enjoyable game with suspense and some skill in a tidy mix.First time playing got me real jumpy and some adrenaline.The down side is that after """"x"""" amount of hours you will not have the same jumpy and scared sensation if you do they will be rare.A really good game for anyone who likes to grind it out.The serious upside is that the games are never the same and can always suprise and test your skills."""
1;IS A REALLY GOOD GAME TO PLAY ONLINE SOLO OR WITH FRIENDS AND HEAR THEM SCREAM LIKE LITTLE GIRLS O A MUST OWN EVEN AT FULL PRICE. UPDATE 10/25/16 GAME IS OFFICIALLY BAD AZZ I KNOW THAT HALLOWEEN DLC YOU HAVE TO PAY BUT IS WORTH IT AND LOOK AT IT THIS WAY YOUR SUPPORTING A GOOD GAME FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THANKS FOR ALL THE HARD WORK DEVELOPERS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. Amazing )
1;honestly i love this game. i have about 100 hours on ps4 as well and i still come back to this game when im ready to chill out or grind a game for a night. its alot of fun with friends but you can still have fun if you are a solo as well. 10/10 would be a toxic meg again &lt 3
1;The game makes so much fun but is still buggy. The developers are working and communicating very much which is so good about the game. They listen and consider the opinions of the community. In the beginning you will have a easier time as killer than survivor. You can even play with your friends which is great. Superb game making so much fun. Try it out!
1;One of the best game i ve been playing.It is a great game where you choose to play as a survivor or a killer. As a survivor you need to team up with the other three survivors and fix five generators and then escape and even be careful so the killer doesn t attack you and hang you on the hook.As a killer you basically just obstruct the survivors from fixing the generators and escape.The graphics is good and even well optimized.
1;It is an awesome game. I am very enthusiastic to see the new content that is upcoming. I have seen a few bugs form time to time some of them good for me others bad for me and others that were just hilarious. The game is still fresh so the are quite some errors here and there but the developers are doing their best to patch them (at least I think so). And over all is really funny to play it with friends especially when you are the killer and they are your prey.
1;I find this game can be really fun depending on if you have friends to join you. Steam sould make a deal where you can buy multiple copies for cheaer and then gift them to friends so it makes you wanna buy the game. Also killers that camp can ruin the fun for this game.
1;Product received for free. I've decided after a couple of years to give more credit to this game.Community still sucks bugs are still plenty and balancing issues still exist...I don't think that will ever change however it is improving.I still play it so have to recommend.
1;Great game although many bugs. It's currently almost unplayable. It will run smooth for an hour then constant disconnects. I'll wipe a team and then disconnections lose points and can't even finish a round. It's not worth playing. Hopefully they fix the several bug issues in the future.
1;"""Do you like salt? Do you like it when a dev says they have """"done a pretty good job so far"""" while they clearly have not?Do you like asymetrical PVP where both sides can only truly win through scummy tactics at high ranks?Welcome to DbD do not enjoy your stay."""
1;Very good spook3 game and it is very fun to play with friends. I thouroghly enjoy the perk system as well as the leveling. Fun to play as killer or survivor both are incredibly interesting and have aspects that make them both worth the while. All in all gud gaem.
1;Really fun game because it requires teamwork to escape. Killer on the other hand feels almost left out when it comes to hooking the survivors. Even with the addition of Myers it makes you look around more instead of just listening for the heartbeat. Either way i would say 4 out of 5 stars.
1;Product received for free. Optimisation score 7/10.My specs Amd Ryzen 1600x 3.6ghz 16gb ram GTX 1050ti 3gb vram.Running on Ultra 100% resolution scale at 45 60fps (depends on map).I think developers made pretty good job so far.On my other computer(Amd A4 5300 8GB ram R7 360 2gb vram) on low textures 100% i get 20 35.Big thanks to devs for makeing this game!!!+ I cant complain i got game on giveaway PP
1;If you want a lobby simulator buy this game! It comes with the best lobby features! like spooky music that doesnt change! Or maybe the barely changing idle animation of your survivor! Or maybe just maybe you could get the loading game screen then you get sent to the title screen! Wow! Quality gameplay!
1;I love this game but by banning people out I think that a no only the hacker one should be ban!still see a lots of hacker around but hell yeah.. Play it ... THIS GAME IS FUN! camping is fine but it's not funif you are the killer that never find the sur you know it FUN if you doesn't get mad by hooking dying or couldn't find a sur
1;Soooo it's late at night and you know you have stuff to do tomorrow and you are on this game. You won't want to stop it's just too good. You'll always tell yourself one more game. It's only 5 minutes one more game. Time will slip away when you play this game but at least you'll enjoy every minute of it!
1;Very fun game when you first get it the fear and adrenaline was and still is one of my favorite parts of the game. I've had Dead by Daylight for a while now and though those factors have worn off over time and i play it as a competitive game now there are still be some killers that terrify me more than ever. But other than that get ready for a nice heaping spoon of salt as you progress up into the higher ranks.
1;I used to hate this game but after several months the devs managed to fix a lot of bugs and they made the interface quite well the only problem is the stupid behaviour of camping killers wich is the most annoying problem in the game since the release but hey that problem should be fixed by the ones who play themConclusion Good game but could be very frustrating some times
1;A game where you can have toxic kids and toxic adults come together into a community. Ranging from getting camped insta flashlighted moried and roasted in the endgame chat. Great to play with friends yet ironically hard to play killer against a group of friends. I love the game I may have periods of time where it makes me wanna kms but its a great game. 10/10 would play Toxic by Daylight again.Ps Nea is the true monster in the game. (I mean look at her abnormal face and hip size) monkaS monkaS
1;I like this game because of its thrilling experience as a survivor who is trying to escape a killer and playing as the crazed murderer yourself. There are a few bugs here and there but are pretty common from what I can see. Great game to play with friends or by yourself.
1;The learning curve is high. The grind for usable perks just to be competative sucks but the game is fun at its core. The game does suffer from peoples play style and how trolly they can be. You'll start to enjoy it more once you forget about rank and winning every match.
1;In its current state probably a 3 1/2 out of 5. The game itself is very enjoyable the problem is with the servers and menus. finding a game takes forever and then if anyone drops out while the match is loading you may as well call it a night 'cause its going to take all day to load. The menus are a bit glitchy and will ocationally freeze requiring a full PC restart to fix.
1;This game is pretty fun and has a really cool premise. However there are multiple things that make it unoptimized. For starters if you're brand new you may still go up against either a Killer or Survivors that should be &lt 10 in level. The 'season refreshes' make this even worse a lot of the times. Once things are done to make sense like changing unhook/disarm from the same button this game could be great. Until then it's fun to play in a group so you can all be frustrated together.
1;Let us see what's happening in this game. At the start it was great fun to play especially with friends. Enthusiasm has died out a little bit...or a lot. If I give just my personal uneducated opinion it'd be something like it's a nice game with some annoying bugs and lags but still worth the purchase if you have a couple of buds or nubs to play with.Killers are OP! Survivors are OP! The hatch is OP! Buy the game I guess.
1;I highly recommend this game since it's multiplayer it has infinite replayability. However they devs do need to recognise that their game is slightly buggy in the case that you can get hit through a pallet. Otherwise you should go pick this game up ).
1;Honstley i really enjoy this game its quite fun. I like it cause its diffrent and really no other game like this out there... It would be cool if they would add more modes such as maybe 2 killers vs 8 survivors and the survivors have to get gas to drive out of dawn to escape! Great idea i love it so far!
1;Aside the bugs/Glitches that occur this game is really fun if you have some friends Although it is annoying when the killer camps you when youre hooked. I reccomend buying this game on sale probably. But if youre sceptical and really HATE bugs then just dont bother with this.
1;Ok First things first First Game my heart has POUNDING Last one alive Got all Generators getting chased got down wiggled out (My heart was pounding even more) Got away and found a trap door in the distance Ran to it and escapedI WAS SO HAPPYFor the little time I played it was fun as hell I recommend it with people with a horror feel.
1;The game is mostly awesome but it has some major flaws. The worst flaw would be the matchmakeing. I played 2 hours already and more than 30 min I spent searching for a lobby. Another flaw would be the fact that you have no option for disableing VSync. The game runs well on my crap pc around 30 40 fps with some exceptions.Tho when you finally get into a game it is very fun. Also the price is good. I got what I payed for. (not like no man's sky)
1;Back to a thumbs up. Game entry much improved.This game is broken. Can't get into a multiplayer games but for rare instances. Sick of the bugs. I really want it to work well because it's fun to survive with friends...and murder them. Get it together guys.
1;I was a year since I played last the game was unbalanced and buggy however after going back there are very few exploits compared to before and balancing is not an issue for the most part they have added many things and fixed many things since then so this is very much a game worth getting.
1;I changed my review. I originally gave a negative review when Freddie was released. Now that he has been out awhile less people are playing him. I still believe he is overpowered but with less people playing him the game is much better. I have bought more than one friend a copy of this game. I play it all the time and have a crap load of fun.
1;This game is good fun when you play with your friends! Buy it and experience it for yourself. It's only 20 for loads of fun. Pro's Game support &gt Developer is community invested Playing with friends &gt Loads of fun! Graphics &gt Running very well on mid range GPU's Low price for what you getCon's Killers that don't know how to play can ruin a game Peer to peer
1;This game is very very amazing well made. And for the peoples that got lag or say that its not optimised go on your task manager and the search for the game in it right click on the process and the change priority and choose high priority i gain 50 fps by doing that well i went to 25 30 fps to constant 59 61!!
1;Good game but they should do more not just turn on generaters than escape they should add more costumes maps and most importantly more modes if you like a game that a killer is hunting you down while you and your friends have to turn on generaters then escape than this is a game for you i'll give it a 6/10 it's very fun but they need to add more
1;Incredibly fun game.Like seriously this game is a very good alternative to the exhausting FPS/MOBA/MMORPG masses that dominate the gaming industry.You can either tryhard as Killer or SWF to chill out a little bit without having to worry about match history hardcore ranked system and all that stuff I REALLY recommend this to anyone willing to try out new things.
1;A really good game sometimes it is very hard but I enjoy the game overall. An average games will take you 15 20 minutes. Fast leveling with the bloodweb system and daily rituals to receive extra points makes the game enjoyable for me. It is fun to play solo and with friends. 10/10
1;PIPU TU BUNDA.Dwight/10 The dev's try to balance the game but with all the bots lack of dedicated servers with no possibility to check your ping DC's constant by killers and survivors because matches are hosted by the killer himself the lack of a sense to have rank in the game (this is the only game that rank it's worth nothing) and the constant nerfs of the survivors you can only have fun with friends and laugh with them of the great variety of bugs.Sorry for my bad english I'm BR.
1;It is a fun game that I think people has split opinions on. I think the game is fun and even better with friends. This game puts you in a rush situation that gives you the sense of urgency to leave as quick as possible. Combining that with 3 other people is what makes a large amount of the game teamwork. I think it is good and fun to play especially if you like killer type games.
1;This is a fantastic game!... when it works!... March 2017 I have hardly been able to play this game with my friend (survive with friends mode) as we can NEVER find a game..... just a constant que! however when i que on my own I get a game... please fix this! otherwise you will loose a lot of players
1;"""TEN BUCKS OMG grab this game! You can play forever and not even have played a killer or even the other way around. Dont get involved with the salty 9 year olds you win some you loose some and both killers and survivors are OP. At first I hated this game cause it was challenging. After a month I loved to see how far I got """"oh $hit now I can do generators.."""" For a casual time killer piece that you can jump into on your PUBG breaks or Fortnite breaks. This is my solitare for my PC"""
1;I like this game a lot I just wish their was game chat in DBD. It would be pretty easy to do. Just do it like PUBG where depending on where your character is the mic can be heard from. And also the killer could hear what we are saying just like Friday the 13th.
1;"""I enjoyed this game. It's procedurally generated levels keeps it from becoming a """"Memorize the map"""" situation. Although there are more than a few players who care more about rank and don't make things fun the number of casual players just having a good time seems larger. Many of the bugs that plagued it's earlier releases seem to be under control. I would recommend this game."""
1;It's the asymmetric multiplayer experience of the got dang century. It's a game where it's fun to play as both the killer and the survivors the advancement/tech tree is unique and engaging and the meta is rich and ever changing. And it's actually scary! Crouching behind a box as the killer walks RIGHT PAST YOU is legitimately frightening and pulse pounding. I can't believe what they've done with this game it just keeps improving.
1;Product received for free. I like this game. Scary atmosphere exciting music when chased and cooperative style. But as a survivor I want the killer to run slower. It's like when the killer sees you the killer has about 70% to chase you down. Try to make a control that can dodge several killer attacks.
1;"""An extremely fun game if you happen to have 5 people around for a private match. Especially if everyone is on the same voice comms.Try to play single or """"Survive with friends"""" online and you get a long long line of...'NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND'"""
1;This game has so much potential. It is a great game that with a few outstanding issues that the developers have been working to address since the release of the title. The real selling point for me is that the developers are present and seem to care about improving this title.
1;Dead by Daylight may not be the most balanced game and sometimes the fun ends really early in the match but surely it has some intense moments for both killers and survivors. For me those moments make this game worth everything.It gets even better playing it with friends so much fun.9.1/11
1;Dead by Daylight is a super fun game where you can team with others (or friends) to survive. Or if your more of the bloddthirsty type you can kill all other survivors in the hopes they don't power the generators and escape. I hope the team will keep making this game as awsome as it can be!
1;It's challenging and really fun at the same time. This is the best game out of all the other games. There are perks and add ones for free so that's basically all you have to pay for is the game. If you are An F2P then you better start saving right now. When you get it have fun.
1;The game is still afflicted by inconsistent matchmaking with friends it takes way too long to connect to a killer to play but the game is an undeniably interesting asymmetric multiplayer experience. There's been a consistent stream of updates with more survivors and killers every few months. I only wish the game had a bit more polish to it. Facial animations look stiff and the hook always connects badly with the hook but it's a fun experience made even better with friends.
1;The game is exactly what I'd hoped it would be and more. Exhilirating fun as the killer and (sometimes) terrifying survival goodness from the survivors. That alone has me pleased but the customization of characters/the leveling system is fun and adds some depth and longevity to the game. It's been a bit sinc ei last played but as of then my biggest critiques would be the bugs that occur and the crazy amounts of animosity between killers and survivors that you can see post game.
1;ive played the weekend madness and my license just suspended for the game. But i like this game i wish there was a way to talk to your teammates in game but you cant nor type at all in game. whitch makes the killer more OP cause there is no comunication lol. But other than that the game is pretty good and fun. But the killer sould be slowed down a bit once he is on your your usually dead.
1;Lets get straight to what this game has taught me and did to me Pros (Goods)*I met a girl that I curently am having a realation ship with*New Update balanced it so much and well*People are Friendly*The fact that people try to rescue others is a sign of good*DLCs are not too expensiveCons (Bads)*People troll alot when they see a bloody party streamer (They Leave)*Not too many maps (Just my idea)
1;The game has gotten alot better since my last reviewTry the game out its good game but understand that the game is more about hiding and you will mostly die alot until you get used to the gameRanks reset on the 13th so around that time you may get paired with people above your skill level
1;Very good game i love it i doesnt have the best matchmaking but for a coop multiplayer horror game its simply the best if youre thinking between h1z1 and dead by daylight i would recommend this but as i was saying the matchmaking isnt best but i love it )
1;Product received for free. Welp scaryyyy at night D My gf's review This game makes me dizzy they should have a stabliser. Also the character are not very asthetically pleasing. Otherwise not bad... make my boyfriend scared and pee his pants. Funny to watch but not funny to clean....
1;This game is such a great idea but there is alot of mechanics that need to be fix like how the killer can strike you as you vault over walls. The matchmaking is also broken times you will be paired w/ a high level killer or a bot. There is a lot to be fixed but the idea of the game is great.
1;This could be a really great game to play with friends but they need to fix the survive with friends feature. The Lobby is really bad where you will have to keep constantly presing ready and searching and ready and searching for people because it keeps saying no matches found. This could go on for a long time and gets tedious. Wish I could play with my friends but its a mood killer dealing with this.
1;This game is super addicting and very fun. Yes it has it's flaws and bugs but still I can't stop playing it. I'm even running it on lower than recommended specs and it's still enjoyable. I like to think the devs are trying to fix what they can and I think it's slightly improved since it's release. I would enjoy it better on a more powerful computer. I recommend it if you're into horror games.
1;While the game has been through some rough patches and was probably rushed to release as a fully finished title this game is a lot of fun.It can be frustrating at time for sure but once you get the hang of the game mechanics and learn the fine details it becomes super addicting to play.Looking forward to more improvements to come (and hoping for no more major screw ups!)
1;I wasn't so sure about this game at first but eversince I bought it and played it with friends it was suprisingly fun. A bit addictive somewaht nervewracking and ridiculous glithces that'll loose your stiffness. One of the things that're concerning right now are the lost of rewards items launch errors or getting kicked out from the server etc. Please do look into it. Anyway overall 8/10.
1;It is a very additicing game and I still play it....I CAN'T STOP. Beware though it has a lot of minor bugs and is quite laggy if the killer is from a different region. It takes some skill so all the justin beliebers out there DON'T play this. Also #Dwightlivematter
1;Good idea medicore execution. Worth buying this game is alread fun and will be amazing once (if?) things are polished/rebalanced. If you're having trouble with the game crashing/freezing mid game try underclocking your graphics card by around 40 50 mhz and decreasing the power limit to 95%
1;First of all great game i love it. But all of my teams for the past 25 games i have played no one helped unhook. 10 of those games the killer camped because he doesn't know how to play the game. Just now the last round I played the killer had some sort of walls because he knew exactly where everyone was 1000% of the time. Also I played a few games where i distracted the killer so someone could unhook the guy and then no one came to unhook me.
1;I generally hate playing anxiety provoking games but this is one of the few that I consistently play at least every other day in my free time especially when I need to wake up before doing some studying. $20 is very reasonable. Great buy and would puchase as gifts for others.
1;this game is amazing or it would be if i could get more then a half of my games to load in. and when in a match playing without myself or a team mate d/c. as the the killer few that dont d/c before the match start i win most of the time because my pray are stuck or d/c before i get to kill them
1;Bought the game on Steam Summersale 2017 and it was WORTH IT !!The game's easy to understand but hard to master.Perks and items combination now this is the type of survival co op game i've been looking for all these time DThis game is very addictive 10/10 AWSUMM
1;I cant play it i have windows 7 i have a gtx 4000 video card and my drivers are all updated i really hope i can play this game again i love this game it is well worth my 20$ but i cant play it i need help plz.Anyone who has any tips or if one of the game desingers can help me plz write or comment back.
1;Great Horror Game. Very original concept and opened the door to a new brand of Horror games.People will be in constant flame battles about survivors or killers being OP but for an Asymmetric horror the balance is good. The game takes time to learn in the beginning but soon you'll be a pro.
1;When I just bought this game I thought that it was not worth your money but then I realized that this game is addicting and there are many interesting things in it. I do not jelly that I gave money for such an excellent game! I advise everyone to buy it.
1;Dead By Daylight is the funnest game Ive played in a long time. There is so much strategy as a survivor and even when your the killer. Every perk has a counter to it. Every person plays a role in the game especially when your playing with your friends. I highly recommend this game to anyone especially with the Free to Play Weekend coming up.
1;Really fun to play but matchmaking is terrible takes forever to find a game if one can be found at all this is really an issue that needs to be fixed could possibly be fixed by allowing matchmaking to happen between multiple countires instead of within induvidual countries that way matchmaking would be much faster (though this may create extra lag).
1;Death is not an escape but alt + F4 is.On a more serious note some bugs to fix and some balance issues but it's still playable (enough to enjoy it) have fun while playing it (don't take it too seriously...)I'd say with the bugs it's worth about 15$ so you should wait for it to be on sale before buying it.
1;This game has been getting better throughout the last year since the launch. Much better matchmaking result. Frequent game patches released by devs. Game mechanisms revisited and improved. Easier characters progress due to better reward from daily rituals. New DLC contents are quite balanced regarding gameplay. Community keeps growing and has been less salty. Killers seldom camp their victims now.I have stopped playing this game for several months and now I am back again.Rating 9/10.
1;I love this game to death. IT is really fun to play once you get to know it and never gets old on a long term level. It is scary the first couple of times you play it but then you get use to the scares which i hate (. DLC's The DLC's expetially the ones with the survivors and killers i think are totally worth the bay due to the fact yull be playing longer than the actually worth of the DLC and the dlcs are just really cool.10/10 would again
1;I really enjoy this game. If you guys watch the second trailer ( the one with the black girl in the tanktop running away) that trailer is insanely accurate to what the game is like. This game is amazing and when youre running away its very scary. The killer walks so close yet they cant always see you BUT YOU THINK THEY CAN. So you clentch your and pray you live.
1;"""started out you can destroy a hook silently for 1000 ptsnext you can destroy a hook which alerts the killer and get 500 ptsnow you can """"disable"""" a hook which still alerts the killer for 500 pts. The hook repairs itself after a few minutesfuture i suggest the devs give trapper the ability to repair destroyed traps so that sabotage will be completely useless and killers can complain more about gen rushing"""
1;Dead by daylight is a very interesting game. Ive been supporting this game since beta and i coninute to support and play this game to this day. its been interesting to see what the team has done to this game from changing mechanics adding new survivors and killers with new abilities and more. I would recommend this game to people if you just like to have to have a good time with friends and be warned there are quite a few bugs in the game.
1;Love this game! Play it almost every day it's such a fantastic concept and very well done. The game mechanics 'story' aims and such are all great. The only problem I have with this game is that it does have a lot of glitches! (and the matchmaking is stupid XD) but it's still really fun despite that. Good to play with friends and with strangers!EDIT They've fixed a lot of stuff now! The matchmaking is great and there are a few glitches now and then but nothing like it used to be!
1;I love this game it's quite nice I reccommend buying it.It's improved since it's beta and got rid of problems. It's probably still a beta to be honest.But all in all the game's improved a lot the community is just Salty Survivor and Killer mains though. Pros Fun Game Luck Tension Cons Killer DCs Salty Survivor/Killer Mains Bug Abusers/Forum CryersThat's all I have to say about this game. Pretty fun.
1;Dead by Daylight is one of the best horror multiplayer games out there! Once you learn how to play you will have loads of fun chasing or being chased. It does contain features that could be improved but the best way to resolve all these issues with the game is getting more players and more community feedback. If you enjoy being under pressure feeling adrenaline and jump scares this is the game for you! Hope you enjoy your long nights playing it! Highly recomend it!
1;I have been obsessed with this game for the past two weeks although the gameplay is a little repetitive having to do the same task over and over again but the different people you queue with make it different each time. I STRONGLY reccommend this game.
1;This game sometimes makes me want to punch the absolute crap out of my monitor while shoving my keyboard down my throat.The game is full of camping killers and idiots who constantly fail skill checks despite there being a noise right before the skill check.Also doctor don't play him or I will actually come to your house with my baseball bat wrapped with barbed wire and nails and beat you like Negan did Glenn in TWD
1;Product received for free. I think this game is great but it really needs serious updates. I think it has great potential and can go even further. Not only that it is also replayable you really never lose intrest in playing. Should deff buy if you havent already
1;Ridiculously fun and addicting. Puts you on edge at first but after a few times playing I feel oddly calm and can't seem to stop. XD Teamwork or solo you can pick either one D And with the different characters there's a few choices if you get them leveled. Highly Recommended!
1;I love this game. My son and I play it all the time. Sometimes it is extremely frustrating like when the killer is a face camper but it s still quite fun. I especially like the fact that even if you don t own the dlc for a particular killer you still get a chance to play with those killers on their maps.
1;It s a very great game even if you have over 300 hours it s still fun to play. So many Killer and survivors you can level and play how YOU like. A bad point is that the games can be so short because of how fast the gens can pop which Killer makes camp so they get a guaranteed kill and maybe some others who try to help. Another bad thing is that the community is one of the if not the most toxic one i ever saw.
1;If they can implement better system to report cheaters and hackers it would be much much better.But for a 20 dollar base games it was actually above expectation of what one can get out of it and the variety of killers and survivors characters is pretty amazing for a somewhat unknown brand and company behind it.
1;Do you like having utterly usless dull empty self preserving teammates? Then this game is for you. This game is so mind blowingly about caring about only yourself that even if you go into this as a saint you will exit molded as a self preserving So if you don't enjoy that stuff be a crazy OP killer as long as you dont get survivors who have grinded their sweat blood and tears to become a God within this game. What am I trying to get at? Great game just play with friends.
1;fantastic game sure there are a few bugs but that to be expected it is still in development and regulary recives new updates and dlcs and the devs have live streams constanly the game play is a mix of sucpence fun horror and adrenaline and the gameplay is unique and fun would recomend 100%
1;Love the game been playing 80+ hours on it. Though I find the new killer which is the doctor is severely OP. His shock at lower levels reveal's survivor's positions which is incredibly OP. Not to mention If you're anywhere near his AOE your insanity will slowly keep rising. Then there is also the displaced shaking skill checks which I think is too much considering his shock already reveals' player's positions. It seems like a copout to make everyone buy the new pack imo.
1;"""Game is the best i played but there are campers with Chainsaw like Hillbilly or Leatherface (I like Leather but i do not like when somebody is camping). I do not like Nurse cause she is teleporting by a """"floor XD"""". BEHAVIOUR should nerf Michael Myers's 1 lvl stalking (that mean they should increase his terror range). Btw. game is very best."""
1;"""It'd be such a great and amazing game if you were able to get a match. Worst matchmaking I've ever seen in a game before. Should rename this nonsense """"Dead by Matchmaking"""" or """"One Match by Daylight""""EDIT Now that we can get matches a lot faster I'm back to loving this game. It took far too long but we are on the right track."""
1;Dead By Daylight is a great game even with the community sometimes being toxic The developers really do show they enjoy what they've created by choosing to keep updating and making new killers for the game along with a map and new survivor. The games best with friends but even without them it doesn't take anything from the enjoyment of the game with four other random players you can get from online.
1;I'll be blunti have spent a lot of time in this game and it is very addictive however there are many things that need fixing although i have found myself immersed in the gameplay as both killer and survivor so for the amount of money i spent it was definitley worth it so it deserves a positive rating
1;This game has up and downs but with the continued support by the devs this has so much potential. Even at its state now it is so much fun. The grind reminds me of why I play video games. One tip is to start off with Claudette and get her Self Care perk. I would recommend you get this game although it can be a pain in the butt sometimes.
1;A really cool game. Despite what it may feel like it is actually pretty well balanced as well. It can be hard for a beginner to really get into however you can really enjoy this game for a long time thanks to relativly frequent updates and the ability to play with your friends. (And it also goes on Sale from time to time)
1;So i buy game a long time ago when infinites were normal and survivor legs were just like a tentancle D and i culd say it was happy time i spend here yea sometimes it was rage couse i was laming in this game at start so bad xD but i culd say it is worth buying it ) i spend 350h in this game and i dont regreat it
1;I can play this game for hours and not get bored. It's a fun game to play alone or with freinds. Also it allows for a lot of customization for the characters that makes each one unique. Pros Playing with freinds is fun and easy No two rounds are the same / Never gets repetative New DLCs quite frequentlyCons Sometimes the game will glitch and get stuck in the middle of a loading screenCan't really think of much cons because this game is generally a fun game to play with few glitches.
1;This game has quickly entered into the list of some of my favorite games. The gameplay between both survivors and killers is rather balanced. Even if some aspects are inbalanced you can easily find a way around it. Understandably this game isn't for everyone. But those who enjoy competetive gameplay and survival horror types where you can't fight back this very well could be the game for you.
1;The devs have recently thrown a few patches at the game and I must say that it's been very positive so far. Firstly the lobby simulator seems to be of very little issue now. There is a delay when playing with friends on Steam that could be addressed but it's a much better experience overall. The graphical changes have been great too and the whole game feels different but in a good way. Definitely recommended and good fun with friends.
1;i will say that i love this game but also will state this game has so many camping killers the second the killer has someone on the hook they won't leave and i played both sides and i dont camp or teabag but people who camp are the main reason why this game makes so many people mad so i do recommend it but beware of the camping killers and if dbd team do punish the campers then the game will be perfect but thats all i'll state and i do love the game.
1;A fun game that now has little bugs and alright matchmaking amazing to play with friends Or solo! playing a killer is great too I've sunk a lot of hours into this game but I got tired of the repetitive gameplay and the game breaking bugs when I came back to this game bugs were gone and It was fun again and I found it more stressful to play as a survivor which I liked It's a very fun game and if you have a friend to play and skype with it's amazing
1;Fun in low ranks really annoying in high ranks (as a killer main). As much as you may enjoy this game it's a competitive game and competitive players will try to win no matter what taking away the feel of the game. Either way it's a good game pretty balanced and it keeps evolving with new survivors killers and other features coming out periodically. Would recommend.
1;New Review the developers fixed alot of bugs and they are constatly adding new things now i can recommand this game DOld Review THIS GAME IS SO ING EPICThe game is beautyful but IT'S THE MOST BUGGED GAME.20 minutes of loading and the game kicks you.30 minutes for waiting players if you're the killer (without considering loading time)Until devs don't fix all those things i can't recommend this game even if i like it and i'm still playing it
1;Amazing game iffy community.Both Killer and Survivor are equally fun as long as you can forgive and forget all the campers and gen rushers. As long as you have fun and make little mistakes then you'll enjoy the game 100% of the time. The only thing bad about the game is the community so as long as you don't hit Rank 1 (joking) you'll always have fun games. Would recommend 11/10 times.
1;Really fun game when it works Which seems to be less everytime I try and play it. Long waiting time to join matches if you at all can get into one. The game ends up crashing alot on matchmaking.Edit Been some months since this last review and since i played the game. started playing again and i must say that all the mistakes and glitches has been taken care of.recommed 10/10 espcially if you play it with friends.
1;a survival game that i just can't stop playing. i'm glad i was introduced to it. the only downside to DBD is that you'll come across the occasional game changing glitch/bug. it's a bit annoying but they're still working on tweaking the game. otherwise great game. i enjoy it greatly.
1;Game itself is fun and fairly balanced. Main issues are the connectivity there are constant issues connecting and getting into matches. Seems like every other week there is a bug or exploit going on. Game could use some fixes but it hasnt stopped me from having plenty of fun with it.
1;&gt Be survivor&gt team mate got hooked at the first 2 min&gt *do erobics while on hook&gt camping killer alert&gt goes to save him anyway with other teammate&gt i let the killer see me so he can chase me&gt got rekked&gt tfw team mates abandoned me10/10
1;Every since i got this game I have been addicted. It has a nice variety of killers and a surprising amount of stretegy. I love the perk system and the extra layer it adds to the game. The only issues i really have had with it is that some killers are seriously under powered such as freddy krueger
1;Product received for free. Hello!This game is one of the most great horror games.I know it since last summer and I would recommend it to my friends but there's something I don't like sometimes in the middle of the game or when I am close to escape the game takes me out and is very annoying.So please do something about that.Thanks.
1;If you actually get to play it's a really good game but in general be prepared to wait for ages to be placed. I wish they would finally fix that issue. As it is I usually play it if I have other things to do otherwise not worth staring at the computer for half an hour before you actually get to enjoy. Too bad if it were just for the gameplay itself full points...
1;The gets from me 10/10.But sometimes every 4 5 games it crashes on a desktop. Today is 22.08.2017 and it still do this.My system Windows 10Intel Core i5 4440 3.1 GhzNvidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti 2 GbRAM DDR3 8 GbSo game is good but it can leave negative emotions because of crashes.
1;This game is fairly fun at lower ranks of the ingame ranking system not so much at higher ranks. If youre playing alone Id recommend playing for fun instead of playing seriously until you get a good grasp on how things work. If with friends be prepared for the killers not wanting to play against your groups its one on four and the killer is alone without anyone to talk to for help.That being said be nice and respectful both sides. These are real people playing along side you.
1;Extremely fun! The horror is subtle but when it's there it turns into another 80's horror movie a small amount of gore although sometimes I wish there was more. Gameplay wise the game is amazing. Visually I think the game looks great the rugged look of everything adds alot more atmosphere.
1;I bought this game almost when it came out. It was really back then glitch under map killer gets teleported outside the map waiting in que for 1h. But now they changed it so much fixed many bugs and glitches. I stopped playing this game for 8months and came back just by a feeling. It is super fun and I 100% recommened this game to anyone that wants to play a puzzel/horror and fun game.
1;I'm loving the game except when a new killer is added to the game and he is most of the time overpowered. But on the other side there are fixes/updated pretty often for balancing things and fixing bugs. I really love this game both from the killer and survivor perspective.
1;Where do I even start with this game. Dead by daylight is one of my favorite games to ever come out on steam. This game has brought me so many funny and scary moments that I will always remember. Whether you're playing with friends or by yourself this game will always be a go to for me.
1;i was thinking i beleive the clown is pretty op. either it might just be were not getting used to it or its a little crazy i had an idea that the clown should reload one or two bottles at a time. or you could recover a little faster from the intoxication. once you get gased... your getting down theres nothing you can do.
1;the game is great amazing actually i never get bored! great job! bc alot of games do get boring... but more killers would be cool like pennywise jason a werewolf of somesort or even chucky the killer doll! but overall love the game thanks! BUT we do need more maps!
1;This is the most fun I've had in a long timeIt feels like you're back in school playing Ditch 'Em but you get to slaughter your friendsThe feeling of being chased as a Survivor feels like it is straight out of a bad dreamHighly recommended wish they'd add an AI option to play offline when the lobbies are sparse
1;Product received for free. Before the 1.4 patch it was a great game and it still is. Sure it has some bugs from the patch but obviously it will be fixed just give it some time. I love this game to death so this is the reason im recommending this and like i said give it some time for them to fix their mistake.
1;Bugs. What are you all talking about? Heck yes. There are many bugs. Heck yeah 50 % of my games someone leaves or im getting deathcamped because Im a noob and falled into the killers hands. Do I recommend it? Still. Yes.Its thrilling its adventureous and its fun to play. Bugs are not too heavy on my side. It launches fine i can get into most of the games fine. Buy it if you have some friends to play this gamew ith.
1;The game features a 4v1 gameplay style that can go from being really easy to complete destruction in 1 simple mastake. Unfortunatley the game is ver limited in it abilities to be able to achieve a very please game e.g. all the perks and addons to change the game completely. In all its a good game if you dont give a sh*t but if you do you will have a bad time.
1;Great jumpscares and layouts of maps. great graphics too. it's pretty addicting when you get the good killers that dont camp on hooked survivors though. bad thing about it is the constant camping of killers. they would hook a survivor and not leave them. if they can maybe the devs should penalize the killers that do this? make them lose blood points for how long they stay near a hooked survivor? movement speed decreases? lose a pip? something to keep them from ruining the experience of the game
1;It's a great game if you don't look at it in a too competitive way. Don't expect to play the next esports game but expect a fun game where you can play a few quick matches and have a great time killing survivors or outrunning the killer.Being high ranked doesn't give you any extra's besides some achievements and your rank gets resetted every month on the 13th.
1;I have to admit that I love this game to death but the amount of malarcy both killers and survivors have to go through mainly killers has really made the game become less and less enjoyable for me. I'm still recommending this game because I believe the devs could still turn all the imbalance around and fix it. But in its current state you will need a large tolerence for annoying people and losing the game to stupid things commonly.
1;I've spent many many hours playing this game and watching it on Twitch and it's been a great time. Surviving with friends is especially fun. It's not perfectly balanced but I do think the devs are listening and it really has improved over time. Overall lots of fun.
1;#BEST GAME Very fun and challenge Co op survival game with friends. Dead By Daylight will bring you many ways to survive run hide or die from the Killers. You'll find yourself with a group of more three survivors trying to complete only one goal power up remaining generators to open the exit gates and win the round.
1;This game has a love hate relationship between people who primarily play killer or survivor. You can play with your friends as survivors or queue alone. On that note If you don't have any friends to play with or like singler player experiences playing killer is really fun.
1;This game is so much fun.Sure it can be frustrating at times with waiting forever in lobbies and toxic players but the feeling you get when you finally hook that annoying survivor who's been running around like crazy or when you successfully escape a killer chase is amazing. I only have 100 hours in this game (so far) and it's already been super interesting. Overall I have to saypretty good job so far
1;"""Really addicting game. Fun as both killer and survivor. While some aspects still need to be fixed such as depipping as survivor because a killer leaves the match it is still squarely in the more good than """"needs work"""" category. Don't give up because you don't get it at first it's a lot of fun once the inital confusion wears off!"""
1;Alright starting this game it got me HOOKED i thought everything was gonna be all DWIGHT This game GENERATED lots of fear even though the killers totally BLIND sided me! Sorry for making you BEAR being TRAPPED in this WEB of puns! (totally didnt steal this)
1;Very gud game the only thing I don't like is recently I got all my stuff reset so i don't have any of my points or levels. Fortunately I made a back up save a week earlier so i'm partially relieved because I would've lost 210 hours of me playing this game and grinding up points. Plus there is way to many bugs and glitches for this to be a released game I got stuck in pallets about 5 times and i only had this game for the 200 hours I played this.
1;This game I have gotten so addicted to it! The perks are amazing yet sometimes really unfair! What needs to be fixed is the ranking system. You get queued with a lot of skilled players in low ranks. Maybe also add 2 killers and 8 survivors! That could be a really interesting challenge! Over all amazing game! Love the concept
1;This game has a simple setup but it's execution is masterfully done it has an insane amount of replayability and the devs are very committed to keeping the game balanced and fun also the mindgames you play against or as the killer are the best part and if I'd explain why this review would be way longer. Definitely recommend this game you get a game that's easily worth 60 euros for 1/3 of that price!
1;Take the role of survivor and work together with 3 others completing objectives and evading the killer.Become the killer and ruthlessley hunt and sacrifice those pesky survivors. Dead by Daylight is an intense game of 1v4 cat and mice with a large cast of playable characters and cunning strategy.
1;I have a few hours in this game and it still scares the out of me. When everyone plays the game properly it's a very fun and enjoyable game. But with any game there are campers and trolls and that doesn't make the game as much fun as it could be but overall I absolutely love this game and can't wait to purchase DLC
1;It's a super fun game if you can get past the toxic people. There are a few bugs that should've been fixed a while ago and the one game breaking bug has been there for far too long. Unfortunately sometimes the game will totally wipe all your data and you have to start over again. This hasn't happened to me yet but if you do get it then back up your save file.
1;Great Game......Gets Updated So You'll Erm.........Never?..... Get Bored........I'm Uhhhhh...Not Good At Reviews.....Do I Even Review Bro.....Bye......Hi......Ok Whatch This....*POOF* *RUNS OUT OF THIS REVIEW PRETENDING THEY DISSAPPERED*..Bye! BadSpelling
1;best game ever play at night with no lights and headphones it will scare the crap out of you please make sure you do these things or it wont have that effect you can play it during the day too but where noise canceling headphones makes it creepy and dont what ever you do dont pop the generator because he will find you and then your hooked like a hooker lmbo
1;No not recommend. its full of bugs addictive camping killers survivors are nerfed to the ground the perks dont always work. Played the game alot I liked it when Killers did not camp when teammates went for saves.BUUUUUUT even though I did not give it a positivie review and did not recommended it I still played it. So your choice.
1;There are a few glitches that can be worked on but overall this game is super fun if you're into survival horror games. After playing for a while I don't get as many jumpscares but I still do every once in a while. It's all in good fun. No matter how many time you get triggered and rage... you still come back for more.
1;Killer covered in blood wipes his/her weapon so it doesn't get bloody. 11/10 Would wipe again.Honestly though the game is really fun. If you exclude some bugs you find here and there it's a great game to play. Definitily more fun if you have friends to play with especially if you are chasing them as the killer! )
1;Let me start off by saying I love this game BUT I hate the community. Most killers will complain about how the survivors need to be hard nerfed while survivors hate all killer mains. But if you are ever in need for a laugh go to the DbD forums. It is a well intresting place.... All in all I love this game.(P.S. There are glitches like they can be game breaking).
1;This game has it's faults but I keep coming back to it. There isn't anything like it that I've played. The dev's are well intentioned and do make changes often. My only gripe would be the community. It's outright toxic the less you have to do with other people in the community the happier you'll be.
1;EDIT Still really fun and the developers have become increasingly better at being involved with the community and providing more content updates!Great game lots of fun and there's a little bit of variety and surprise with each round. The game can get a little bit repetitive but It's a constant challenge and I love the suspense of each round!
1;This game is good but i think producer should fix more this game bug and unbalance . When i join lobby or loading game they should have a loading template. Finding player or finding game is too long. I dont want to say or complain this game but this game need a Revolution.Although the game is great but there are still a lot of things need to change And i hope producer make me proud
1;Fun and addicting game can be agitating at some points but got me addicted plus my friends. Some things are wrong with it though 1. Killer's are trolls recently because of the ranking systems 2. Lots of bugs and 3. Not an in game chat. I would recommend putting in a similar one to that of friday the 13 where it's proximity chat. But all in all I find this game to be a blast!
1;I think they did a pretty god JOB so farr..Fun game addictive...and soo ing frustrating at times but i have about 250 hours and im not even close to be bored of this game....by the way the hag sucks please rework them oh yeah and sometimes when playing as survivor the killer i play against its from ing solomon island and he has 1000 ping...if you can do something about the matchmaking too..
1;There are times in this game where my heart is pounding as much as my character's. Very well done. Love the balance. There are others but this one adds an element of surprise. You don't know who you're up against until the match starts. Unless of course you are the killer.
1;This game is qutie good. But it's going to bad because ... (just my opinion) the server is suck ! Why can't use the middle server than Killer's internet that make ping so high. but I still love this game develop still be around us do this game move on. hope keep it that way.
1;This was the ultimate Party Game for my Halloween Party. It left a lasting impression on those that have played it and wasn't easily forgotten. We still play almost each and every night on this game as a party of four. The thrills the spooks and of course the daily grind of becoming that pro survivor. Every little mistake a game changer every great skill check a blissful reward. This game is THE ULTIMATE SUVIVOR COOP.
1;Loads of fun especially with friends. The only real problem is the still buggy sometimes unfair and just overal randomly kicking you between the legs matchmaking system which doesn't seem to be a big priority for the devs (?).Other than that it's easy to get into and you can do a quick match whenever you have a couple of minutes to murder.
1;Sometimes we cant click to help friends from hook and after new patch i always dc and found many bug and this patch ranking system is too bad i find rank and i found killer rank1 but our survivors is 15 12 20 20. It's not balanced. Plz fix this for good game.
1;My favorite horror survival game its very fun but once you get expirienced it gets boring after awhile. I think the game needs to add a different gamemode like 2 killers and 8 survivors just to keep the existing members interested. But other than that a great game with occasional bugs and glitches but still fun. )
1;Product received for free. My friend gifted me this game for Halloween. Very fun game play loop for both killer and survivors. The progression tree is fairly quick to unlock perks that make each character fall into a unique niche. Have had a lot of fun playing both together and alone. sp00ky/10
1;A fun game whether you have 10 hours or 1 000. I've been playing since Beta and still get immersed to this day. This game is best played in small doses and I think as long as you don't take losses too seriously you'll have more fun. Despite matches having the same goals every one is different because you're constantly playing with/against different people! The replayability is super high and I'm still enjoying it over a year later.
1;Have poured many hours into this game at the time of writing this review and haven't regretted it. Dead by Daylight is always there for me when I need a game to play by myself or enjoy a good time with my friends. The game can be suspenseful at some times but it just makes it even more fun in my opinion. Gameplay is fun and the community can be great depending on who you talk to. Don't hesitate to pick it up you won't regret it.
1;"""As I silently loudly fix this broken generator. I turn my camera around to see if im being watched. No one in sight. I continue to fix it for 2 minutes. I start to hear heavy breathing. I turn around and 3 count em THREE metres from me is Michael """"fricking"""" Myers The Shape. I scream loudly break the generator even more he stabs me puts me on a hook. Then I bleed out and wait for a teammate to save me. 10/10 love this game so much."""
1;Honestly mimosas and the little half niglet Claudette just make my night. I think this game is a total 10/10 if you enjoy salty that enjoy face camping you and then flaming them afterwards in chat. I've had the most fun whilst getting farmed by every asian that comes past me when I get chain hooked because of the hoe. All in all would totes recommend to the common autist. Thanks and a lovely day.
1;I think Dead by Daylight is a really great game. I bought this game last year in July and I stopped playing because of face campers making the game less fun. Then I started playing it in September this year and I'm having a great time playing games that i haven't played in a while and I just love it.
1;I think this is a really nice game you can kill people or you can not be killed you gotta be smart and a good listener for both survivor and killer cuz you never know whats gonna happen when you walk around so if you like death and sacrificing and stuff this game is for you btw its brutal lol
1;The Game is fun tho many bugs both funny and dumb can get kinda boring sometimes but u kinda come back after some time and of course amazing characters I really recomend playing this game but it will be more fun if u have other people to play it whit u then i recomend to let them try the game and maybe they will buy it too see you in the game&lt 3!!!
1;This is a fun game it's in active development and new updates have been ongoing on a reasonable schedule which keeps it pretty fresh. I really hope they end up adding different game modes at some point might be fun to link together maps and adding more killers/survivors or even turning the tables and giving the survivors an opportunity to fight back? I don't know but I've got plenty of hours into this game and plenty more to put in before it's all said and done I'm sure.
1;90% of your games will either be up against total noobs who have no idea what they are doing or you will be against some one who has all the ultra rare perks and has 1000 hours plus matchmaking is so unbalenced it's unreal. but it is good fun playing as killer or surviver so i think its worth 15.
1;I think this game is cool you should buy it even if you have a potato computer. I have to decrease the resolution and the graphics but it's worth it. Only buy if you're not alone because this game is too hard alone. The game is kinda scary at first but you'll get used to it. Old Man
1;Graphics 67/100Framerate for middle end pcs 46/100 (could use more graphic options to raise framerates)Community 56/100Gameplay 75/100Balance of killer to survivor ratio 39/100 (survivors have a bit too much power over the killer)________________________________________________________________________________Overall 76/100________________________________________________________________________________Good Game________________________________________________________________________________
1;This game is pretty simple 4 survivors try to get generators going to escape the level before a killer sacrifices them on hooks. Rinse and repeat that for every level. That being said it's pretty fun to play. If you were to play it a lot it would probably get repetitive. I think this game could hang around for a while if the developers continue to push out updates and DLCs. Time will tell. I purchased it when it was on sale for $10 and at that price it's worth it.
1;Although I have my salt momments they go away and this game makes quite a fun experience.It might have toxic players but you are not forced to read their hate.It requires a lot of strategy and lately it has received many fixes and additions which greatly improved it if you were to compare it to 1 year ago.I am very happy of what is it has become and there is no reason not to play it if you saw it liked it and you see it on a sale.(also if your PC can handle it too D) 10/10 piece in my library.
1;It's not outlast 2 but the nurses breathing is strange....If you want to enjoy this game play it as a survivor with 3 friends of yours.You will destroy the poor killer )))This game needs good hardware.If you have a 300$ laptop don't bother in any way.
1;I love almost everything in this. Well balanced scary and nerve racking. Only the bad things in here are the people who camp. They are extremely annoying but with some good teammates its still doable. With friends its even more fun and on the plus side you can take adventage via a voice over. DLC are fun good balanced and are very varieted from each other.Would love to see some more emotes (for taunting killers P)
1;This game is ing amazing but let me tell you why.The game is FILLED with bugs and even if they are being worked on (the devs DO care) it seems that for every bug fixed 2 come out. Sometimes is a little glitch sometimes is game breaking but in the end EVEN with all of that the game is super addictive super fun spoopy and best played with friends. I absolutely ADORE it.
1;Really good game and great fun to play it wil friends ! But for me I can only play half of it because my internet is a bit so I can't play killer ever. Really hope they change how the peer to peer matchmaking works so that it chooses the person with the most stable connection and not the killer only also the random loss of progress is a fantastic way to off your player base!(edit Killer works now so good game D)
1;Fun with one or more friends. If you're alone...it can be fun but mostly it's not.Badly optimalized bugged lobbies...which sometimes can be REALLY annoying. So if you can't stand this it's not the best game for you.The killer can scare the sh*t out of you. It has a good atmoshpere sometimes you feel totally helpless...it's part of the game DIf this game is on sale give it a try )
1;I ain't gonna let no level rank 1 camp me and mess my rank up.No but actually this game is very good on the aspect of making you drop some down your hole the killers are cool and the survivors....well lemme tell you 'bout..................................................................................................................................................................................FENG MIN
1;&gt Killer starts playing seriously. It's actually pretty skilled.&gt Killer hooks the first survivor.&gt Survivor suddenly disconnects.&gt The rest of us start pointing at killer and spamming duck button.&gt Killer becomes friendly. Lets us get XP and gets for himself as well.&gt We are now best friends.10/10 would practice social reintegration again.
1;This game is awesome but it was buggy.NOW I'm changing my review as per November 2017. Bcoz the developer really care about the game and fix several bugs already. Thank you DEV!THIS GMAE IS A MUST PLAY it is the 2nd best HORROR multiplayer game in the history of gaming the 1st one is DECEIT!
1;This game has definitly higs and lows but overall its a fun/frustrating game to play. I main survivor but play killer from time to time and trust me when I say some of the killers need nerfs/buffs/etc. but theres nothing you can do about it until its recognized by devs so complaining isn't going to solve anything.Good Game.Worth the money.Especially fun with friends. Practice your killer skill because the SWF groups can be a bit tricky.WORTH IT!
1;i dont know why u guys split the countries into there own regions?? cant you make it so people in new zealand search for players in australia and newzealand automatically? because there are very few players in newzealand i have to change my download region through steam in order to actually play the game
1;there is only one thing i can say and that is the doctor he is literally my hard counter im a big baby when it comes to scary games dead by daylight was tolerable more adrenaline pumping and anxiety giver than scary and then my first seconds into playing against the doctor made me hate him and loathe him with a passion with the doctor as the killer i have to play with one hand covering my face good game doe i just hate the doctor for being good at what he does
1;there is only one word i have to say about this game. yes. since i got this game 5 months ago i loved it from the start. tho some bugs and broken killers/perks have been added into the game overall the game has progreessed. is it perfectly balanced no. is it next to bug free no. is it fun yes and that is all you need to know.
1;Dead By Daylight has fun addicting gameplay with a nice leveling up system for your characters. Perks add variety to your abilities and each game is unique depending on your choices. This game got me back into multiplayer after giving up on shooters. I can happily play this game from my couch. Highly recommended game that is a great value.
1;For people looking to buy DbD for the sale do it. It's a great game and the negative reviews shown here are mainly residual salt and the game has improved a lot both with bugs and balance and general polished ness so dont take the top reviews here as definite. Its a lot better now and was before.
1;This game is extremely fun to play with friends. Although there are times where it is glitchy when trying to start a game together and you have to create a lobby together every singe time it is definately a better expierence with friends. Now that that's said some of the DLC Killers are a bit overpowered but the more that you play against them the more you learn how to avoid and escape them. It is all part of the expierence. It is a fun game and worth the money.

1;Great game not finding any reason to stop playing replayability is good although if this isn't your type of game then you won't find much replayability. Haven't got very far into the game perks/progression wise only 1 character to lvl 50 nearly 2 with 83 hours (although i may have been afk for a few hours idk).Overall a good 4v1 horror survival game(if your into to those things) and i will hopefully play for a lot longer then what I have. Also screw you campers why do you do what you do?
1;No skin on my bottom lip from nervous biting as survivor. When killer if I lean in closer to my screen I can catch survivors faster. 11/10 would accept as gift from friend once if not twice more. UPDATE Over a year later the additional killers and improvements to progression have kept me truly addicted.
1;Didn't think i was going to like this game at first. Started getting it to it because my friends were playing and I loved it. It is just really enjoyable surviving with friends or when no one is on you can just go on a murder spree on strangers. Overall I do not think it is overtly unbalanced. There is always an opportunity to win against anyone.
1;The game was very fun well done graphics are on point their are some glitches but only one major problem with the game that most need fixing. I lost alll of my progression after about 1 2 months of playing because of a steam file saving issue. Dead By Daylight needs to look in on that issue majorly. I am currently not playing the game because of this issue but hope that it won't happen to anyone else.
1;I got friday the 13th on my ps4 and it was alot of fun. But it got repetitive after a while so i got this game. its so much fun you dont even know. its a bit repetitive but what game isnt? So for 20 dollars i would most definitely get it if youre into slasher games. XOXO Arealbot .
1;Been enjoying each single minute of my playtime in this game. Though the game to times are a bit buggy/laggy it's still entaining. I would recommend playing with atleast a friend or if you're up to the challange try teaming with random people which at the same times makes the game harder since you never can predict your teammates or the killers next move.
1;"""Used to be called """"Waiting Simulator 2016"""" but now I enjoy it. The only part that is a bit frustrating is at the beinging of each month when everyone goes back to level 20 so you have people who are really at level 1 playing against players who are truly 20's. Game is fun and the developers are always adding new features and hunting bugs. I'd suggest getting the game and waiting for holidays to purchase the DLCs."""
1;Far far FAR too glitchy and buggy for a decent recommendation at this point.The gameplay itself has only a few bugs exploitable match ending AND inconsequential.The menu has too many bugs for me. The main being IT WILL CRASH.Over the past two nights I've played it's taken (both playthroughs)FIVE RESTARTS of the game just to find a match.They need to fix this immediately. They have since fixed this game. It's a lot smoother and more balanced. This pleases me.
1;Waiting for Lobby Simulator 2k16.Don't get it you spend 20 minutes searching for a 10 minute game.EDIT As of October/November 2017 the matchmaking System has been greatly improved and as far as I can tell there are no problems finding a lobby and playing. I have played extensively in the past days and found a game in mere seconds. Updating the Review to now recommend the game.
1;Pros and Cons Pros Fun game lots of fun when actually playing as both the killer and survivor tons of replay value. Level up system is interesting and varied and the perks help enough to see the difference but not so much you can't play without them.EDIT Servers fixed! love this game!
1;This game I have killed 700 hours and it still has me drawn in to this day it has a level of skill and levelling that is different and interesting but in no way revolutionary. This game has the constant repeating game which I like while others may not find it amusing. I recommend this game 100% and hope to see this game grow into the incredible game it s becoming.
1;If you're a horror flick fan and always wanted to be a brutal murderer (or run from your life against one) this game is for you. With each new DLC Killer release (some even free) adds on a totally new insane layer to the game. Also Bill got left for dead so now he's in this game!
1;I think this game has a lot of thought in it and a lot of effort put in it but this irritates me a little how ot says its co op but if you and one of your friends want to play this game you have to do a private game insted of inviting them to a lobby then eithere doing a private game or moving to a quick join so you can be in a game with one of your friends and 3 other random people
1;I would like to say that the DEVs are wonderful. They listen to the players. There's no such thing as a perfect game and I admire the dedication that they put on this game. I sincerely would like to thank the hard work and effort they put into this game. I gladly recommend this game now before with the bugs NO. But now... YES!
1;fun game with friends you can bait them as you are getting pursued by the killer so that you can escape leading to your friends getting hunted leading to you hearing them just swearing at you as they get dragged into the basement by the killer... which makes you save them for the free points and continue the cycle.
1;Despite some longer wait times that can happen with online multiplayer games DBD is extremely easy to pick up fun and exciting to play and even more fun when you start mastering each character's abilities. This game is truly addiciting and gives you a rush of adrenaline that only a good horror movie can provide.
1;"""The classic """"You need the DLCs to have the full experience""""Besides that it's a good game not much to say just that the system matching is total almost every rank 20 get's to playhh with a killer with rank 10 or better wich doesn't sffect me and shouldn't affect anyone after you get used to the game."""
1;"""Really fun game to play with friends!! It's okay by yourself if you're playing killer. My only issues are the matching system and that you need a good computer to play well. Also you don't get bloodpoints in """"Kill Your Friends""""... still highly recommend!!"""
1;There are still bugs but to me the game is fun to play even with different play style such as gen rushing camping pallet hopping and so fourth. Sure you will get ****** off in this game it happens. The killers only want to hug you and keep you there forever.
1;There's quite a bit of free content that comes with the game and continual updates rebalances and new content is added regularly. There is a large fanbase and plenty of people to play with. It is definitely frustrating at times for both sides but I've had a lot of fun playing the game.
1;Dead By Daylight is fun game where u kill the people you call friends or randoms you play as one of the stabby people and kill the 4 people who want to leaveas the survivors you have to repair power devices and open the exit door as the stabber you have to hit the suvivors and hang them on fish hooksit is fun game
1;This game is fantastic and very fun. This is the best game I have ever bought for $60. After a major update along with a string of smaller updates DBD has become close to bug free and is now very playable. New content like maps and charecters for free is appreciated. The devs have now allowed you to play with your friends and strangers in a way that actually works so major plus there. I would st rongly reccomend this game.
1;Easily one of the most addicting games to play.Highly recommend this.Playing as the survivor is very challenging at first (IMO) then you learn some tricks from playing killer.My favorite killer so far would have to be the nurse.I dont own any of the other dlc.Although I am thinking about getting some for the killers.Hag seems a bit much tho too campy.
1;Edit Fixed! )Very buggy lobby. I can't play as killer with my friend and 1/10 times the game crashes in the lobby. Despite these issues my friend and I both experience they have released a number of DLC. Why create DLC when you can polish your game? I wouldn't support developers like this and I wouldn't recommend this game.
1;Dbd is a great game After you deal with the few people that taunt and facecamp you get to the real gameplay. The game has so many interesting gameplay features that have not been seen before. Dead by Daylight is a great game that I would proudly recommend
1;This has to be the best $20.00 game I have ever played. It is pretty balanced whether you play suvivors or killer and the devs actually listen to the community. There is still some work to be done on the game but they are going in the write direction with every patch. Keep it up!
1;Honestly one of the best Multiplayer Horror games ive ever played.with the contstant growth and expanding interest in this game the develepors are working hard for the best performance for the player.they listen carefully to what the players have to say and adapt their game if needed.the gameplay gets better as the game progeresses. been here since the BETA and have seen a lot of positive changes bugfixes and expansions.overall id rate this game a 9/10 !! thehook
1;its a nice game somtimes laggy but if you love the game like i do then this is the best game you can schoose you just need a good internet if youwanna play killer when i bought it i had some problems but i just redownloaded the game so thats al the problems but the game itself is AWESOME!!!!!
1;My absolute FAVORITE game EVER. I'm addicted to it. I recommend it to any true horror fan.Also don't be a killer main or a survivor main. Learn to play and appreciate BOTH sides. I play both killer/survivor 50/50 and I get much more enjoyment out of this game now.10/10.
1;very very very goood game the only issue i have is i always get the infinite loop of loading and im very fortunate to actually get into a game. The devs really need to step up their game theres too many bugs i really wanna play all the time but find it absolutely ridiculously hard even trying to get into one.... INFINITE LOADING neeeds to be fixed!
1;Fanatstic game regularly updated by the devs. My only complaint is the huge chunk of the community who insist on abusing each other post game win or lose. If you're going to be one of those people buy something else. If you are a fully functioning human who can play a game and have fun without getting salty then dead by daylight is well worth playing.
1;EDIT I had told myself that I would change my review of the game once they patched some of the bugs in this game and they have!Originally I did not recommend this game due to the myriad of bugs that actively worked against you. Thankfully the DEVs stepped in and fixed them!
1;I played this game with some friends and hot damn it was fun!Dont be in it for the win but for the thrill.Its absolutely nervewracking and its nice to finally find a game that has some challenge to it!And its rly nice that you can save your earned blood points so u can use it on any victim or killer to upgrade em!All in all i would recommend this game! (y) D
1;This game is extremely fun to play even more so with friends. Some players are more annoying than others but if you don't get toxic players then the game is highly recommended by me. The game is also kind of competitive so if you don't like that then the game may not be for you.
1;Bought this game on sale when I felt like trying something new..And I have to say I am very impressed. This isn t a 20 hours in and I couldn t be more bored sort of game.The first week of playing was a heart pumping thrill ride!! Second week of playing was time to get serious and start hitting my strapsThird week in and I am not slowing..When your hands are shaking from fear/excitement/coffee.. You know your onto a good thing!
1;Why do I bother reporting CNTV was bady blocking which you specifically get reported for and yet he is still online. YOu guys need to focus on that more or say to all your fans that you let griefers go through the game freely. This is a good game just please fix this.
1;This game is the the future of survival horror the wait times and constant re readying up has made me defecate in my pants countless times. The real fear of being in a lobby looking for a couple people for over an hour has turned me into a hardened veteran of the game. The bloodpoint system is cool too.
1;Cons Laggy Servers (no ping screen) waiting time (1Minute 2hours) Bugs (Stuck in a Tree lobby problems etc.) Fix all that and its a nice game. Update Ping Screen is now in the GameWaiting Time drastically decreased to 1 5 MinutesSom Bugs still thereNow it's a nice game )
1;This is fun in its self the comunity is like LoL toxic but its still very fun to play for hours on end. If you can look past one side either Surviors or Killers being OP for weeks then definately get this game if you are easily triggered by what people say or do then dont pick it up.
1;I love DBD great concept and the devs can do a lot more if they listen to community. Bugs don't the game up as much as people say what ruins the game is camper killers.(Devs NEED to fix bug that doesn't let you win after you escape through door instead it leaves you to walk around out of bounds in a never ending game unless you get escape hatch or killer kills you. Happened to me last night and weak killer didn't even let me get hatch after I rekt him. )
1;Game is fun definitelly recommend for a group of friends who want to play together. Its still kinda unbalanced in different aspects. There are issues like bugs camping toxicity crashes... But overall its a unique game give it say 1 2 years and all of the issues should be fixed(maybe not the toxic ppl tho )
1;Dead by daylight is a very fun game with a lot of things happening everywhere so this game is for people that have good reaction and think smartly. I think that this game has a very good age barrier and has very good quality settings and Dead by daylight is super fun but even more fun with friends you can play multiplayer both with randoms and friends. You can also rank up your characters and use four different abilities there is over 20 abilities you can choose from.
1;sure its still a good game even tho theres many bugs n more. i still can handle n fine iwth it. it just...toxic community. i dont really like those ppl who just randomly called someone noob. well respect pls? theyre probably new or just not play da game for a long time. this all just make me remember of those ing kids from cod or cs who never shut their mouth n keep troll/insult people randomly
1;Very active player base and a huge variety of killers. It is a game that can induce massive amounts of salt but the majority of the player base takes it on the chin. It's constantly being balanced and updated as well. There is a lot of love poored into it from the devs and it's definitely worth the full price of admission.
1;Soooooo much fun to be had in this game. Play with our without friends you will enjoy your time surviving and escaping the killer or taking on the role of the ruthless antagonists your self. Does not get old especially due to the incentive given to the players through all the perks items and add ons that can be acquired.
1;The game without DLC's is medium ballanced but the DLC Killer are P2W.Look at the pig. It can't be heared like the ghost plus has a short sprint boost and traps which are more powerful than traps from the trapper. All these abilities together in one killer! WTF?And it has a lot of bugs but you can have fun with this game.So I can recommend it but only to buy while a sale. It's not worth for more.
1;Really good game but there is some issues that needs to fix . first thing is too many campers and this games need system like banning campers and let other players play normal . there are also too many bugs and thankfully they being fixed . Game is very funny and i'm really enjoying it &lt 3 Maybe there will be too many updates in ther future thats makes game more interesting .
1;Dead by Daylight is a fun online multiplayer 4v1 horror game where you must survive for your life by repairing generators or kill the survivors to please the Entity with your sacrifices. You can play with your friends and try to survive the trial together (or not) and makes the game much more enjoyable for casual players.
1;If you like to mine salt you will love this game. Play as killer and every game the survivors will be salty regardless of if they win or lose. The games community can be pretty toxic but its worth dealing with for this game. After 100+ hours I still scream everytime i turn my camera around and see Mike Myers staring at me.
1;Great game I absolutely love it. However it is not for everyone. If you are ok with dying over and over and over again you will be fine. You will get mad quite often at first because you aren't used to the game. Control scheme is the same as most games so you won't have that as a learning curve. 3rd person survivors and 1st person killer makes for a new style I haven't seen in many games. And lots of cat and mouse ant OH GOD A BEAR TRAP!
1;This game is awesome! In the beginning its not so good but when you learn how to actually flalight blind and save people from the killer it starts to get intrested one thing really cool is that you can moonwalk me personally I can do it but only for about 5 7 seconds don't get discouraged.
1;this is one of my favorite games but i have a few gliches to report1. there is an odd glich with pallets if you pull one down at the right time the killer will get stuck 2. there is a glich where when the game ends sometimes your cursor is invisible and its very hard to find the exit button3. as the trapper (it may happen with others) when you start the game your camera doesnt circle you sometimes and when that happens and the game starts when you walk you can see your head bob up and down
1;Great looking game with horror but not to much and teamwork but not to much either this game is amazing graphics whise and gameplay wise and i also like the characters back stories and unique traits because it adds favortism and connections between you and your survivors it would be cool if they made a 2 v 8 match making where there are 2 killers 8 survivors and a lot of generators and chest will be in the map. it will add numbers and replay value to the game!
1;If you love running around mindlessly being chased by a killer and expecting a lot of bugs then this is the game for you! Just kidding... it's pretty fun if you don't come across campers and just BM killers/survivors in general... and also if you enjoy a cold slippery and pointy metal thing being shoved into your upper part all the time then this mIGHT just fit you perfectly c Happy surviving/hunting
1;This is to recommend the serious attitude of the studio towards Chinese players and the fun of the game itself. But this human onslaught will seriously affect the gameplay experience of the survivors. I understand the purpose of the horror game but asymmetrical games need to be balanced in some sense.
1;If you want the fear that comes with running/hiding for your vitual life from a living breathing blood hungry muderer you have found the right game. If you seek the thrill of hunting down your weak coweredly prey then by all means join in on the hunt. This is by far the best multyplayer game ever.
1;The game itself is alot of fun in a slasher film kind of way. sometimes when I play survivor I find my heart pounding like a drum. It can take some time to get into it at first but I personaly love it. The only major flaw I have with it is it's kinda hard to connect as a survivor for me but I can always get a game as a killer.
1;simply put the best 15 i have ever spent!Recent patches balance the game ever so slightly moreStill an issue with certain killers not being able to stop gen rush But overall fun expierence only adivce to any new players close the chat as it CAN be toxic
1;Dead By Daylight is one of the awesome online survival game i had ever played. I recommend this game to all those people who likes to play horror or survival games. Once you purchase this game believe me you will be happy as ever for any game. I will support Dead By Daylight Forever.
1;100% my favourite game the wide variety of maps survivors and killers means this game doesnt get old as long as you dont mind a lot of salt like even more than csgo. If you don t mind grinding in games buy this because it s so worth it it can occasionally be buggy but more often than not it s hilarious. Relatively easy to run as well.
1;It isnt a solid 1vs4 game. But it is a very fun and good 1vs4 game.Much Much MUCH better then evolve.If you are looking for a game that you both can play with friends (it is very fun with friends) and solo. And like a little horror. This is for you.ps. there are some small issues/bugs but the developers are moderately updating the game and soliving the issues )
1;I have sank enough time into this game to say I have thoroughly enjoyed this game.Throughout the updates and patches it really has improved the experience overall.For what its worth I do believe somethings need to be balanced a tad better but its great to survive with friends!
1;I would recommend if all of the bug get fix and....pls have a new type for the searching game When I plaing with my freind who's rank 5 and I'm 18 its took around 30 min to find that freakin lag room....so pls fix this one first and you'll have a lot of fun for this game.
1;Super fun game that you can't play without pulling your hair out unless you have five people or wanna play solo. There's no lobbying system. It will literally take you an average of maybe fifteen minutes to get in the same game which is all for nought if the players don't connect. Buy it when it's playable.Edit It works now. Buy it.
1;Previously I had complained that the various bugs made the game unplayable. As of 1.03 there are still bugs but they seem far less common or egregious than they were before. The game is now fun to play it's far from perfect but I can now feel comfortable giving it a good review.
1;Honestly I get really scared of horror games but let me tell you THIS GAME IS ADDICTING to play. I played for two whole weeks and it's really fun. There are some bugs and glitches but not a whole lot. The only downfall is the players rather than the game the game is prewtty good but the community is kind of toxic by toxic I meant facecampers/normal campers. The physics in the game are super well done.
1;I haven't been able to get into a match sense the update. When I join a lobby and the game starts to the load screen I lag out? i've tried a couple time's and it just seems not to work..Even though I'm having problems I still recommend the game..even if everyone is still an .
1;Don't listen to any negative reviews on this game. If you read them you can tell that they are salty or haven't played enough to even know what they're doing Please give this game a chance you won't regret it. It is simple but very addicting and so much fun.
1;The Only game i play more then DbD is Counterstrike i love this game the hate the trolls and mostly the salt in so many games )Balancing can be better survivors just too op if right played. The Killer looks like a barbie dolls in so many games.But in the end and overall good game and definitly worth a buy for 20 or lower price!
1;"""I used to love this game. The style and design intrigued me and it was so addicting to play. However the game no longer will start it would always say """"launch error"""". Anyway I highly reccomend this game if my issue has happend to anybody else I am sorry for that but once again this game is phenominal."""
1;I absolutely love this game. Even though I really suck at being a survivor I enjoy being the killer. I love the new direction they are taking this with actual killers and survivors. Now if they could add Ghostface from Scream and Sidney Prescott that would be great. Until then keep up the great work.
1;The game is overall fun but comes with its share of bugs and glitches as well as the ability for some maps to have spots where the killer can never catch the survivor. a side note to this is that the devs are looking into this stuff a lot and are preping patches and fixes since the end of E3.
1;I do like the game it is only really fun with friends. Too many trollsThe graphics are alright the sounds are decent the gameplay is nice and all of the features work well together. but problem is you will have wait for so long to find a lobby so i hope they will fix it soon. other than that Game is great never get bored )
1;h1 How to play Dead by Daylight /h1 1. Wait for 6 hours to get into a match2. Use perks that you will never have time to use3. run away from the killer because he found you in the first 3 seconds4. die because all the killers are overpowered the nurse is a motherFu... 5. rage because your teamates dont save you6. get no points because you died7. switch to killer8. be epic because its immposible to lose as killer9. ???10. Profit
1;This game is endless fun and it scares me from to time But it would be AWESOME if they would fix the matchmaking lobbies from making you wait a long time to find a lobby and some bugs in the game but since they added a new killer it looks that the devolpers do want to make this game more enjoyable so hopefully they will hear our cries and try to make us more happier but other than that the game is pretty dam fun and is worth my money!
1;I like this game because you can feel like the prei or the predator you can feel the fear that maybe you can get killed or you can fell the trill of the hunt as a killer maybe som patch are up and everything but devs are very responsive they try their best to keep balance or atleas they are trying and they put alot of attention to they public you can check reddit if you want they read all about us and apply suggestion etc. give it a try
1;If you except the pallet vaccum changes the camper killers face camping killers the toxic survivors (me) and getting hit and the killer not even touching you... its a great game... I have 300+ hours and Id say its one of the most addictive games Ive had until they removed the pallet vaccum D
1;The game is amazing I'm perfectly content with it being a party game for me and my 4 other friends. Bought it yesterday and we played it all day. Fun game wish you could play with friends in the matchmaking system but other than that the game is amazing.
1;There is one objective for 4 of the 5 players....SURVIVE. This game is a blast! Definitely worth the money 17 dollars. I was hiding in a basement the killer looked at my locker then went to the one accross the room. I was able to escape but man was my heart racing. This game is so much fun. It reminds me of the fun I had in the original left 4 dead
1;"""Developer1 now for the final ingredient """"a pinch of salt""""Developer2 .......thats not a pinch of salt SteveDeveloper1 im sure it'll still be fineDeveloper2 that was a full cup of salt Steve im pretty sure you just ruined it.Developer1 lets just continue with it.Developer2 yeak ok."""
1;This can get so addicting as I am a huge fan of the horror genre in general but I'm sure people of all tastes will come to like it. Even if you are not such a fan of serious or scary games it can be hilarious if you let it be. Dancing in front of the killer to distract them from a friend can be terrifying or a big joke depending on the player. I definitely recommend this game to all.
1;After over 300 hours on xbox and pc combined I can say that I love this game. The graphics and gameplay are amazing and the backstory is left vague giving it a real horror feeling to the game. their is so much variety between matches (excluding red ranks) and it is always a thrilling experience. The only downside to this amazing game is the toxic community so if u can handle that and love horror then this is for you.
1;&gt Plays as a toxic Laurie&gt Has max level DS&gt Killer downs me and picks me up&gt Perfectly lands my DS skill check&gt TBag the now stunned killer&gt Killer disconnects10/10 best game on internet.get italso if you want a teammate just add me i'm happy to play )
1;I first played this game for about 20 hours when it came out. Only really played killer and loved it very much. Then about that time PUBG and some other games got super popular with my friends and I took a break from this game. Decided to come back and 280+ hours later I love the hell out of this game. It's really fun chasing people around and killing them. Also playing mind games with survivors is so great.
1;This game is tons of fun and me and alot of my friends love it.That being said this game would be better if their were some changes such asmore game modes (one gets kinda boring after a while)easier ranking system (its a horrable system tbh)and more killers is a personal prefrence im not gonna talk about a matchmaking system with friends since thats being added into the game )
1;Well can't deny the salt in this game but despite that it's so fun with friends every match is like a movie. For example a killing getting your friends and you are faced with bitter options like leaving your friend behind and running for your life or trying to save him and risk getting caught as well. really fun and updates are decent bugs are funny dunno why ppl complain about them too much. totally recommend this.
1;Love the game well and truly.But god damn when you join a lobbdy and load into the game and either the host leaves straight away or too many players leave so the game ends.... YOU SHOULD NOT LOSE OFFERINGS OR LOSE SURVIVOR RANKS FOR THIS. Like seriously wtf? Please fix.
1;The whole game is amazing &lt 3 buuuut ... there is more turning on and off the game than playing. Every fu*king time i play one game there is no chance to play a second one witchout crashing.This game have a big potential and it have a lot of updated but not the once that they need.PEACE &amp LOVE
1;The lobby isn't working properly sometimes I'm teleporting due to bad connection or so. However I like this game it helped me to overcome fear of being chased. The community is quite good not that salty and rude as in the other games but there are also exceptions (unfortunatelly). Also HIGHLY ADDICTIVE game.
1;This game is really great and I would recommend it highly! The Devs are constantly working on it and improving it so hurray Devs!!!I won't lie the lack of dedicated servers sucks because I am at the mercy of not only the killer's internet but how far away from me they are. There are still bugs in it but they are being worked on. Anyone who claims the Devs don't listen or care probably just doesn't like some of the changes that were made or are not being patient for one specific fix.
1;This game is great! Its fun to play alone but when you start playing it with friends the only time you will play this game is when your friends are online because playing Dead By Daylight with friends is one of the BEST experiences you will have playing a video game. However there are a lot of bugs that I would literally suck off the devs to fix. But other than that this game is fricking great and I 100% recommend if you are looking for a fun game to play with some pals.
1;This game is insanely fun to play. Playing the game with friends or without is fun and addicting. Good heart workout. You will always feel like you are gonna have a heart attack. Enjoy the game. It is worth every penny. Have fun and Sweet Nightmares. 9/10 rating.
1;"""Dude You Should Make a Villian of Chucky And For Survivor Andy...I can just imagin a faded voice """"Hi I'm Chucky Wanna Play?""""Or Have a Clown from the movie """"Stephan King Called It Classical"""" And also instead of forest In Underdead Malls w/Elevators"""
1;This game was great until new updates doesn't let me queue with any of my friends. Even with a 2 man group queue takes over 10+ minutes. I played alone enough to where playing with my friends were preferred due to being bored. I been trying to play with my friends since the new year started )
1;This game is very fun to play I thought the overly simple premise wouldn't hold up for multiple play throughs. I was very wrong. You will get owned the first few times you play either as a survivor or killer but once you get a few games under you its a real blast.
1;I REALLY love Dead By Daylight but the problem i'm having is..I have a MAC. I used to have a windows but since i got my MAC I haven't been able to play Dead By Daylight. So If Steam could possibly make it possible for MAC people to play Dead By Daylight on a Mac please do so . Thank you &lt 3
1;Stupid anti cheat check is too slow (takes 2 minutes in average some times 10 minutes+)and has 1/3 chance to fail (I didn't do any cheat to the game).Today(Dec 14) I've spend 1 hour on loading &amp restarting again and again without a single successful game.Except that it's a good game.
1;Dead By Daylight is esentially a jacked up version of tag. More specifically it's a jacked up version of cat and mouse.With that said the main thing I want to focus on is that if you go in to have fun. You will always have fun. This game is mecahnically super sound. they have a great amount of content for the price. Most important though is that you will walk away from the game with stories and experiences especially if you play with friends. 100% DBD is worth a try &amp worth a buy.
1;Product received for free. This game is 2 years old but still gets updates I really like this game.Fun alone but its funnier when you're 2 or more. It's easier to communicate and win.This game will trigger your weakpoints and make you scream like a little girl.And yes you will get extremely triggerd on some of these killers.But after all great game.
1;This game is so much fun obviously it gets repetitive after awhile but because the developers actually seem to care about their games it gets updated in a reasonable amount of time so there's always something new to make the game more interesting. The way the developers made the story line of the game is so fascinating I've never seen anything quite like it!
1;One of the greatest games out there I have played. There are 4 Survivors and 1 Killer where survivors try to escape by activating generators and opening the exit gates while the killer hooks survivors and sacrifices them to the Entity. I love this concept in this game plus the DLCs and characters you can play as survivor and killer. I would recommend this game if anyone is interested in a game like this a 4v1 multiplayer horror survival horror and co op.
1;Very fun to play whether you are a ruthless killer or a cowardly survivor. Work with your friends or don't to survive the trial. As a killer kill your friends to appease The Entity. I have yet to queue up with actual friends but it is still very fun to play with complete strangers. Heck sometimes a friendship develops because of a mutual understanding throughout a trial.
1;Player is irritated by another players.But it has been enjoy for me since I play for 100 hours.this game seems simple game because of seeing twitcasting.Further killer simply chases survivers at this game.However all killer is numerous addon(add power to killer) and ability.For example shot walp chainsaw seeing or and so on.this ability change how to chase so We am not bored.Let's play this game.(caution) there are numerous whip for this game's charactaristic.
1;I saw this game come in go in the puiblic spotlight for many months until I recently decided to purchase on a friends recommendation. I was honestly impressed from the get go. The amount of thrill in escaping a killer or finally opening that exit door is unmatched in most other games.
1;Dead By Daylight is a really good game. I reccomend it to people who love horror games. If any of the creators read this comment i would really like it if ( and this is just an idea) if GhostFace could get implemented into the game. He can teleport to lockers as one of his abilities. Again this is just an idea
1;Worth buying and playing. The community is ok to nice also the best thing in this game is that your skill is in the center ( sometimes luck counts a little bit too) You can play whenever you want and with who and how you want. If you are not a that gets triggered fast for every single thing then this game will just suit you.
1;Out of 10 stars I would give this about 8. The match making system seriously needs an over haul where your rank determans the group you get put with. Would love to see more outfits for the characters also. Other than that the game is quite fun playing solo or co op with many chalanges that keep you on your feet. All in all i would recomend the game.r
1;such an interesting game asymetrical 1vs 4 u chose to be a killer hunt for survivor or be a survivor to survive the trial... on the first glance people will judge u for playing this type of game esspecialy if u play as killer... but later they will undertand.....ps dont lose heart just becouse the game had some toxic player just play to increse your lvl get some bloodpoint and level up
1;This is one of my favorite game this game can be fun and scary at the same time i love this game this game got a great comunity a lot of bugs but bugs that makes the game a perfect game in my opinion this game is great to play with frends and sometimes solo very fun game
1;This game is fun to play as both killer and survivor. If you play killer be prepared for everyone to call you camper whether you actually are or not. If you play survivor you will probably do fine because the more expirenced players will keep the killer in a loop while you hold m1 on a generator for a minute.
1;Hated it solo loved it with atleast 2 friends then it finally became really enjoyable. Except when you're always the one spawning next to the killer/dying first.Match queueing simulator.It would be a lot more fun if it wasn't always laggy as thanks to P2P.If I didn't have to search 25 times to get into one match.If I didn't get kicked out of a lobby everytime I found a match.
1;A very fun and tense game. It feels great to skillfully dodge the killer on a survivor and help your teammates while decimating an entire group of helpless people is amazingly fun on the killer's side.It does have a few balance issues but the developers attempt to patch weekly and fix bugs in a semi timely manner as well as have weekly streams about what they're doing.
1;"""I've changed my review to recommending the game because it seems even though there's still the problem of having to press the """"search for lobby"""" button multiple times instead of pressing it once and waiting overall it's much easier to find lobbies now and swf is not complete garbo. Although balancing is not the greatest and there's still plenty of bugs to go around overall it's still a very fun gaming experience. Nice work with hotfixes devs."""
1;it's very fun and can get addicting the more you play just note that there can be many frustrating moments such as salty killer/survivor very good players or mabey even survivors blocking your escape. just focus on the good parts of the game and do your best in the fog )
1;This game is a FANTASTIC fun multiplayer game I would defiantly recommend to anyone that loves horror movies like me this game does great on all of its designs on killer and maps and over all it's just a great game that deserves a lot of props for the overall amazingness of this game.
1;Overall its a Brilllent game lots of stuff to unlock different characters to play different killers to play loads of perks to mess around with new content added every 3 months on average.Like most games thou it does have its fair share of toxic players toxic killers camping killers tunneling killers trolls and cheaters.But dont let that stop you getting the game you dont game them that often and it really is fun to play.
1;Ik my avatar is cancer but here is my review. This game is fun afEspecially when its the pig or any of the characters you have to buy theres also stuff you can get like toolboxes and med kits to help you survive the only thing I wish they added was more stuff to hide in like under beds and if they added where you can lock doors and I wish they added crawlspaces so you can crawl under houses.
1;Dead by Daylight is such a unique game you can experience the game from both the chaser (killer) or the chased (survivor) POV. Quite a simple concept but requires team play strategy (sort of) and luck. Being a multiplayer game you can play with friends (and even kill your friends!)One thing though I do recommend starting as a survivor. Once you understand the game mechanics then try playing the killer You will definitely suffer as a novice killer!
1;So this game is fun. But has a couple of bugs that still need to be fixed. They aren't that game ruining though and if you have played Evolve this game is better and is also the opposite version of it. 4 Survivors vs 1 killer. Both sides are very unique in perks and abilities. 9/10 IGN
1;Was about to delete from my library but then the Curtain Call Mid chapter update came out and made killer challenging to play against. As a survivor main I find this awesome. I hated winning every time.There are still some smaller balance issues but overall this game is insanely amazing and addicting now. Salty survivor mains spamming negative reviews are just toxic sore losers. Actually take criticism and improve yourself ya big dummies. Stop dwelling in the past and move on to become better!
1;When you want to hunt or escape something need excitginf experience many way to play the game outstanding characters and costumes. Dead by Daylight can meke you feel like that. Sometimes you can run run run hide hide hide help help help your friend. Each day you have any mood. Sometimes you want ot kill someone torture or pretend survivor. Support your any mood.Try it. Escape or Kill'em all.
1;This game does a great job of making you feel your role when you play (scared and nervous as a Survivor the need to murder Survivors as a Killer). Of course you'll get those Survivors who have no fear because they are monsters themselves p Definitely recommend if your looking for a thrilling gameplay experience. Note This game is a ton more fun with friends when playing as Survivors than going as a lone Survivor with strangers (although still fun not AS fun).
1;Do you like to sit still and have a staring contest? Well THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.This game includes the following features you'll love Facecamping Pallet looping T bagging flashlight blinds Tunneling Bodyblocking Sandbagging Lag switching Bad Matchmaking Buggy hitboxes and anything that is related to bugs Bad Game coding getting stuck at something Hackers Farmers AFK killers Salty Survivors/Killers AND MANY MORESoon to come )
1;from when i first started playing killers were good and survivors were in a good spot. Now the tables have turned and it feels like killers are agitating and really limited to what they can do as you get from ranks 12 and below you start to really see the struggles of the killer. being a killer as of this review is by far the worse mistake anyone can do.
1;This game is freakin awesome! I had pre ordered the game funny enough the game released on my birthday! It's an awesome game it really gets tense this is a true horror game. The updates on this game are so dope every time the game is having a update it's becoming even better!
1;I rate this game 10/10 best game everPROS Best dlc price! great game the devs update the game like every week and idkCONS i know facecamper right? i really want a co op killer but survivers get 5 Gens 6Still af game bae//my price that i would like// //13$//
1;an overall fun game challlenging to to win either if you are the killer or the survivor. the only issue i am having is while a match is loading after the offerings and items have been equipped you will lose them if you take too long to load into the game and been kicked to the main menu.
1;+ I really like the game! Its really cool! The thing I hate about the game is that there isn't enough people playing and its really really hard to find a room The killers always camps and watches you die and your teammates cant save you!The game needs a lot of fixing...The new update for halloween made it really fun!
1;Hi!It s being a lont time since I last played DbD but I have tried to get in again since a few weeks and the game doesnt launch. Everytime it charges but then it says Launch Error and only a Exit button.I have tried to redownload the game 2 times but it just doesnt works. May someone help me please?Thank you very much. Reyix
1;Probably best to buy on sale. Good solid game which a few debately illogical mechanics however can be very fun with friends or solo play for either role. Consistent updates and events alongside a reasonably sized dedicated fanbase. Queues are rarely long. Overall 8/10 Dwights
1;Really great game all though i've had some issuses in the past with my lobbies never loading up (i've waiting for up to an hour before with no one entering). Hardcore pallet looping survivors is a very fustrating issue that sometimes really makes me never want to play killer. Camping killers is really fustrating when playing survivor as well. but all in all when you get some decent people playing together its a pretty great game.
1;Dead by daylight is an amazing game that I love to play. I currently have almost 300 hours in the game but the game also refuses to let me play 90% of the time Ive been sent back to the campfire Ive been playing ready up simulator and now I am playing Cheater detected simulator. I cant seem to find a game as surivor or killer and I have restarted steam multiple times. Its a great game when you can actually play it.
1;Honestly the only bad thing about this game is with certain players. Those that too tryharding to hoard points themselves that either playing selfish as a survivor or guarding the hooked player until that player dies. New balancing is done periodically so the problem is getting less.
1;I don't know what's worse the fact that swedish methheads with a ladyboner for flashlights bully me every waking second of my matches or the fact that I've started hanging my pizza deliveryboys from meathooks in my basement. In all seriousness the one thing this game has taught me of value those in the closet deserve to die.
1;This game has a TON of bugs and ping. But luckily the devs often fix it and deveop new contents. So if you don't like the game with a lot of bugs and ping don't buy it. But if you don't mind that point you shouldn't miss this game cause everything else is good.
1;Welp.. I got this game 5 days ago... Since then I have not slept due to the terror and have logged 65hrs in the game /Do not buy this game if you like being able to sleep. I can't stop playing!Do buy this game if you enjoy being hunted chased and scared sh.tless while you run for your life and try to escape!!

NO REBINDING FOR KEYSThis stays negative till they """"add"""" this """"feature"""" X)Edit 29.05.2018 okok its save now"""
1;"""I love the concept of the game but sadly you can only play survivor at the moment because the game is extremely unbalanced so killers wont have any chance against a good survivor team. Thats not how a horror game is supposed to be. """"This is outrageous it's unfair!"""""""
1;Awesome game. Currently have little over 200 hours into the game and I recommend it to players that love a good jumpscare if you play as survivor and taking time to master your killer or survivor. Once you get good at the game you will learn it is very easy. There are sometimes bugs and rage moments but if you are relaxed and try to have fun this game will be so much fun for you.
1;Ignoring those bugs this game s a good game.I prefer playing survivor in this game playing with friends and having fun. Killer is quite hard to get rank up and also hard to open up a game lobby since too much player in killer nowThe rule and system of the game is quite interesting atmosphere is really scary. Good game overall!
1;I honestly really like this gameit's dumb frustrating and the players can be pretty toxic but at its core it's a fun multiplayer experience that captures the essence of the horror movies it seeks to replicate (most of the time). It's a unique game and I think it's worth a play.
1;Totally worth it. It's not perfect. It has a lot of flaws but this game has come so far and will only go further. The devs are actively making this game better and coming out with new content all with their community in mind. I highly recommend this game.
1;A really suprising game! I had or have so much fun with it. The only problem I have is that sometimes they have difficulties with balancing the game for both sites. But nvm a great game D!! I am waisting hours on it but it was totally worth it so far...
1;Dead by Daylight has a great concept and is executed well. The only problem with the game is the balance changes that occur after every update due to an unbalanced perk or an unfair advantage on one side or the other. It has gone through so many changes since the beginning some for better and some for worse. It is a good game currently but I personally prefer early patches of the game.
1;A great game with a lot of fun intentions.... The community definitly tries its damnist to ruin it out of 8 games about 5 of them will have the survivors feeding with the killer and when you don't play along they just off you. Its really cool when your teamates decide to get you off the hook right infront of the killer just so they can down you 2 more times. I love the game but people are making me dislike the feeding system reaaaaaly hard right now.
1;The first steps of the learning curve are the hardest after learning the basics its quite easy to polish your weak points and learn new moves.8/10 Pros lot of theorycrafting and skill to developcons i dont like some killers mechanics&amp stats like freddy / the pig you have to google info about all the killer's perks in order to dont give easy kills noob killers arent punished enough for campingSomething you have to use before playing your first gamehttp //www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/
1;Ever since I got this game it's been my favorite. This game is awsome in its own ways. The Devs are always updating and adding new things. It's really addictive and I guess in a sense somewhat scary.Pros AddictiveFunMultiplayerCan play both Survivor and KillerCons It's unblanaced in a waySome survivor perks are just too stupid and overpowerdSurvive with friends is really hard to play against if they know what they're doingOut of a 1 10I would give it a solid 6 7
1;great game! i love playing it as both the killer and the survivor but with that said the level of toxicity and salt in the community is insane. If you have a thick skin and a no to give attitude you are good to go but if words hurt or you suffer from low self esteem stay far far away lol
1;Can you make changes to the queue where you can't queue with the killer as a friend. It really just kills the game when your suriviors helps the killers to kill you. I am getting a lot of these game where my teammates just puts panels down of no reason and also they lead the killers to others. They also unhook us right in front of the killer this just really kills the game. But this game is pretty good just need to fix some stuff to become a great game.
1;Game is extremely fun once you get into it It takes bullying to a entire new level because now you can blind a killer with a flashlight and he will never get you! BUT DON'T WORRY They can place bear traps and use a chainsaw to mow you down so you better bring those long life battieres and Low Amp Filaments.
1;I watched a couple Twitch streams and this game looked exciting and scary. Once you start playing with friends it's incredibly funny and scary. You have no idea how many times you'll get startled or scream especially being hunted by certain killers. It's very entertaining but playing solo queue isn't as good.
1;I don't write reviews often but I felt this game really deserves one as it blows me away by how immersed I can get while playing it. Everytime I am actually on edge trying to stay fully alert when I play as a survivor and have even screamed at one instance where one of the killers completely took me by surprise. First and only game to ever make me have a reaction like that an instant favorite just at how into the game one can get.Forget 10/10 just buy it already
1;It's a pretty fun game overall. The grind to get characters up to par is a bit tedious and annoying as you cannot go up in ranks as a solo player without ranked up perks (which require ranked up characters. Playing killer and survivor are equally fun. Survivors have a better chance of escaping if you don't play the only two really good killers
1;Tried it on the free weekend. Within 5 hours of gameplay I went ahead and bought it (on sale 9.99). Both sides are challenging and fun. Its better when you are playing with friends that you can talk with. If you don't join as a group you will be in a match with randoms and no way to communicate with them. Overall its definately worth the $10 I have abandoned many other more expensive games before I will this one.
1;Good and bad. The gameplay is fun the graphics are excellent and the sounds are great but the community is absolute cancer. If you play you'll be killed cheaply survivors will escape cheaply and you'll be insulted for being too good or bad (or just 'cause).
1;Pretty damn broken game. Still I love dis game. The devs started to make the killers stronger and survivors weaker. The pallet vacuum has disappeared they will nerf ds selfcare etc. They are buffing killers so I might change from survivor main. Still very fun to play and as always being toxic.
1;The game might be a little twisted from the killers point of view but if you don't like to slash people's guts out of there body then just don't play killer! I have almost 200 hours now but half of those hours are afk hours but the 100 hours I have actually played i've enjoyed! So if you're looking to get this game I hoped I helped &gt
1;I absolutely love this game. Don't think of it as a competitive game and it'll be great fun. Starting and learning the game can be a little rough but the developers are constantly working on it adding new things and are so involved in the community. New killer (The Pig) is so well done very cool concept and lots of fun to play as and against.
1;$20 for over 800 hours of fun (at the time of writing this I m sitting around 820). Keep in mind this game is actually quite competitive a lot more competitive than one might think but the high skill ceiling for both killer and survivor make it a game you can constantly work toward and grind out.
1;Highly recommend this game. Why? SUPER fun Cant get enough of it And is awesome playing with friends. Although you can't join your friends in a public lobby im sure they will be fixing that. If you like games they get your heart racing then this is the game. Just a heads up if you buy this game you will get super frustrated playing the killer But when you snag a survivor and hang them on that damn hook. You will feel like the most accomplished person on the planet. 10/10
1;The game in itself is a super fun party game it has good mechanics and bad mechanics the devs seem to be caring somewhat about the community but the community is pretty 2 sided and salty at eachother everything has gotten alot better recently but it will never be a good competetive game its more of a Jackbox at this point.
1;I've played this game for quite a while now and I can finally say that its going in a good direction. Many new maps many new killers and frequent changes to perks. I can finally say that if I lost this game for whatever reason... I would buy it again.
1;I am a very experienced player in Dead By Daylight and all I can say about this game is that it's a good game but i left the game for a time a very long time and i came back and stated that not many things changed they added new dlc and new map etc they fixed a lot of bugs but there are still more so i'll give a 7 / 10 for this game because of the bugs and there can be more optimization in this game.7 / 10 )And the last update made a sound bug when u move camera )
1;I find this game to be extremely fun and enjoyable. It isn't really scary (unless you play against Michael Myers) but it can be challenging and difficult. It is also even more fun if you play with friends. I constantly tell my friends to pick up the game all the time!
1;Just good fun a game that does not t its customer base just good blood thirsty killing fun DEVs are cosntantly fixing little bugs and keeping ontop of any exploits love playing both killer and survivour. Would definitley recommend it and this is coming from a bloke who plays games like Dayz WoWs and WoT not my usual tittle but damn im enjoying it. 10/10
1;It is a great game. really fun but not ment for weak minded people.The toixic unreal hatred from survivors is a part of the game it seems.The survivors will use their toxicity just as much winning or losing.I dont play survivor myself its way to easy to win as a survivor thats why i play Killer.Its a real challenge to try win as a killer and im realy enjoying it even if i lose.
1;Very enjoyable game into which I've sunk many hours. It has its flaws and its occasional bugs but on the whole I'd say it's well worth the money. DLCs are usually good and reasonably priced. If you want an assymetrical PVP game and you enjoyed Evolve or the L4D series then there's a good chance you'll enjoy this.
1;If you get hooked and see someone hiding behind you its already too late you are now just another victim another name to be added to that persons farm list The only way to pip now is to farm your farmer and turn him into the victim .Also when you have farmed the ever living out of him you must now fulfil your destiny and farm the rest of the survivors The entity demands it.
1;Great leveling up (permanent reward system perks n sutff) system. Keeps you on the edge of your seat with consistent horror elements. Nice graphics and pretty smooth gameplay. Lots of stuff to choose from to customize how you want to play and the game is always improving even if slowly.
1;This game has quite a few bugs and a few can just destroy your match and immersion but it gets more and more killers survivors and items each year. I will definitely continue to play and get the DLC content for a while as it is a fun game with a clear difference between hardcore and casual on both sides of the coin and the developers are trying to make the game better with their streams and fixes for either over or underpowered killers and perks. I would recommend at least the base game.
1;Love this game. Only about 150 hours but it is one of my favorite games to play to date.This game is still kinda buggy even though there's updates often. It's more of hide and seek at this point with the killer because some items are unbalanced but they seem to be getting ont track to fix that. Hopefully more positive updates to come.
1;Its not done still has a ways to go but is fun besides the bugs &amp people constantly leaving lobbies making the match making times incredibly long sometimes.. Just needs more skins for survivors &amp killers ways to talk to teammates ingame party system &amp bug fixes and this game would be ideal. 7/10 for now
1;Short review (6 17 2016 Might expand later) + Fun cat and mouse gameplay+ Interesting teamwork/solo balance gameplay+ Different killers/perks/tools/procedural level elements to mix things up Several minor release bugs (Certainly soon to be patched) Many players blowing up my generators lol. PSeriously though very fun game with randoms or friends and minor issues that will certainly be patched up soon enough. )
1;I really like this game just wish the mechanics were better. Joining the game at a later stage makes you feel like everybody else is too over powered to have a fighting chance. Overall I'd recommend it but feel it needs a little work specially with the lobby system as if you are playing with friends you have create a lobby after each game. i.e. Create lobby play one game then you have to create a lobby again to play another round seems a bit bonkers to me.
1;This game is bugged as . randomly kicks you from the game. lots of lag. getting in to a game takes forever have to hit the ready button every 5 seconds and there is no reconnect becasue the game is hosted on the hunter computer (hence the large amounts of lag). you cant turn the music off in the game menu (super anoying).... this needs alot of work to make it run smooth. do not buy intill they fix this so this changed a couple months ago its a pretty good game now.
1;The game needs better matchmaking.. I just started the game when I play as a killer the survivors are way higer leveled than me and have great perks.. When I try a survivor guess what it's the same for the killer.. I thought this game was supposed to do match making based off level or something.. Other than that its a great game.
1;"""A game where you can experience bugs like no other. From flying to space spawning on top of a house is where its at. The developers are incredibly autistic and boardline braindead with the game. Fun to play with friends. """"I think we've done a pretty good job so far"""" A Dead By Daylight Developer"""
1;Dead by Daylight is a good survival horror game. I like this game because this game contain different types of maps survivors and killers especially licensed map killer and survivor. I will recommend this game to all those people who likes to play survival horror games.
1;I don't know if it is only me but sometimes when i play as survivor and press find a lobby it would just be stuck on waiting.I get off and on the game just to play 1 round.Can you please fix this problem because other then that it is a great and really fun to play!
1;At its core it's a 5 player horror survival game where 4 players take on the role of survivors and 1 player take on the role of a killer. The survivors' objective is to activate 5 generators located throughout a map and make their escape. The killers objective is well to kill the survivors.
1;Before patch 1.5.1 &gt Don't buy it you will die waiting for a match... I never played an online match only with friends. Was 30min waiting for a match with 2 friends then we quit the game. Next hour we tried again but this time with a full team 3 friends with me same thing after half a hour we quit the game.Fix &gt changing server to uk londonNOW patch 1.8 it's PERFECT a few bugs but very playable!
1;This is pretty cool game for those who are like horrors and want to know how to be victim.Would be good to add a bit more abilities to do something. Not just launch the engines and totems and suitcases.Would be good to have some another opportunities.
1;Product received for free. This game is so amazing! I love it every match that I play i discover a new way to win rescue people escape alive save people make fast generators be great in the skill check new killers new survivors new peeeeeeeeeeerks and others things )) i realy love this game! oh yeaaaaaaah! it is so crazy and creepy this game is 10/10
1;i reccommend this game for its gameplay and quality of gameplay are very well done and presented to players easily.Multiple play styles are possibly (even if higher rank gameplay doesnt show it).Only real negatives have to be that the report system has no affect on its players.Final thoughts are that this game is definitely not a bad pick me up and try game.
1;"""Great multiplayer co op survival game but community has """"little"""" toxicity. Game has few issues and bugs.Some perks are so powerful that some people climb ranks just because of the perk not by being good.And when skill and those perks combine it's just disgustingly overpowered.But you know I'm HOOKED."""
1;This game is amazing! you can play with friends or you can play with random people. You can be the killer or be the one desperatly trying to survive! It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time! you can build your character and play different characers. You have several maps to play which is awesome! And the killer selection is to die for lol IF you have not played this game you are depriving yourself of a endless fun end of your seat experience. Get it now!
1;Dead by Daylight is honestly a really good game the only issue that I have with the game is its community. You will usually encounter some form of toxicity no matter what you play. If you have thick skin and laugh at people who rage at you then this game is for you!
1;Product received for free. Great game no game is the same because of the different killers and survivors! I would recommend this game to everyone who likes coop survival or to be a killer!Its a strategy game but you need some skills some perks and some balls to be a bait for the killer!Feedback Maybe add a voice chat for survivors and some games are lagged out by the terrible network of the host (the killer).
1;This game is alot of fun till you shut it down come back later and you have lost like hours of game play or any point gains you have made. With this as a issue that has over 4 days happened to me twice now. I cannot as a gamer recommend something that pisses me off so badly when it occurs.
1;This game is amazing! I love playing as both killer and survivor but I must say I find it even more fun to play with friends as a survivor. The community is mostly made up of good sportsman like people. You may run into the occasional griefing teamate or camping/tunneling killer but they are few and far between. I appreciate how the devs listen to the conserns of their community/fanbase. This game is some of the most fun I've had on a multiplayer only game and I can't stop playing D
1;The game may not be very balanced but I enjoy it a lot. I am a killer main(unfortunately because the game is survivor sided currently) and even though I always get flamed by survivor that I kill and threatened with a ban from them I just take all the salt in and I have no problems. It does have moments when you feel horrible because you have no ruin and survivors gen rush you but the game is addicting nevertheless.I'd give it 8/10.
1;Product received for free. GREAT if you are okay with everyone calling you a cheater or camper ( even if you put down a trap or bait as pig) after each match because people are SO salty in this game. BUT it is very fun and i enjoy it very much. great gameplay as survivor and being a killer is just satisfying. and to the people that hate me in game..... lol stop being mad.
1;Matchmaking and Balance have come a long way since '16I can recommend this game for people who want to get jump scaredalso if you are into constanly feeling worry and terror this'll be funBe advised these feelings only last about 100 hoursafter which you discover the games mechanicsthen you become a time managing wizard and ruin some poor kids day
1;One of the most fun games I've ever played. In total on this account and my other account I have 700 hours.It can be frustrating to play killer versus high ranked survivors but I find the challenge a part of the fun. When you purchase the game prepare to get your ss handed to you much like in your first MOBA. But you will have fun you will learn and you will git gud.
1;I have loved this game since it came out and played countless hours and when I can't play I watch streamers on twitch. Despite some bugs and imbalances here and there this game is full of thrills and the devs are constantly updating it. The DLC's and new maps are fun and fresh. While some games I stop playing over time I always find myself back on DBD &lt 3
1;Dwight is life please dont harm any dwight you see. If the entity wants something sacrifice that claudette look she is hiding in her natural habitat tall grass. Or look that Ace is running around the pallets go loop around and around to play the classic run around in circle all the time that brings you the pure happiness.
1;I love gameplay except when being hooked camped but the gameplay itself not problem Most of my hours in this game is waiting for game to load up if you can somehow fix that you are golden now dont be a and were cool you ll know when you are in the action of a move in this game believe me you ll know.
1;Dead By Daylight is well an interesting game... The devs are constantly releasing rushed updates that fix minot bugs but add even more major bugs. The matchmaking can be a complete mess but usually is pretty good. I would recommend this game but prepare for a lot of toxicity and salt. It's still fun tho )
1;After some initial doubts I have found this game to be quiet addicting. The game has a great atmosphere and never fails to give me adrenaline rushs while playing as survivor. The only negative things about this game are the sometimes long matchmaking times and this one bug where you get stuck in a tree and can't move at all.
1;While it may seem repetitive at first after getting the hang of DbD it keeps me entertained for hours on end. There's always a different way to play based on the perks available and playing it with friends is the most fun thing for me. My one wish is that some day there will be a single player mode. D
1;Hmm.. no need to talk about graphics and gameplay things..They are just great...everyone knows that...it will be even better with dedicated servers..What i want to say is that this game needs emotes for killers and the ability to chat with everyone in the game while in lobby..Everyone will know the feeling that u've been called a noob when u're just trying to focus on daily rituals...it's annoying
1;Highly suggested game this is super fun and would be better with more people it would be sad if this game died but their is still a lot of people who play it look up how many people play this game I think its better with friends cause you have no communacation what so ever in the middle of the game so me and my friends use discord
1;There are no words to describe this game. Well maybe a few Toxic Hillarious Chaotic and A blast to play with or without friends. High praises and I cannot believe how much the recent dlc's have been improving compared to some of the older ones.11/7 Highly Reccomend
1;This game may be really annoying and at times with all the bugs and the peer to peer connectionThe toxic survivors and killers and so onBut this game can be really fun especially with friendsMost matches are different from the last match even if you get a camper or somethingGame is amazing despite the flaws of it
1;I went into this game expecting not to like it. I thought it would be full of toxic people who sabatoage others and make it unenjoyable. I was very wrong. It's built so you really do need to play together to win. It lets you play as survivor or killer or both. There are tactics to learn tricks to discover and it gets your adrenaline going. No internal chat/voice while playing helps and doesnt kill the ambiance with toxic douches. Better than expected and has quickly become one of my fav games.
1;Really fun game to play with friends. When I bought it a year ago I didn't play it much. I had 10 hours in a year on the game. But now I have 110 hours in a month. Then I didn't play it with friends and now it's really fun with them. Sometimes there's toxic community but not that much. U can meet there a lot of new friends if u have not got any to play with.
1;Prepare your butt for the GREATEST SUFFERING that this world has known! Playing this astonishing game you will face an amazing community. You are welcomed in this residence of toxicity which contains lots of fun for every taste pallet looping gens rushing camping tunneling teammates getting you farmed AND MORE! bugs. These badasses are made to make you cry tears of blood. hours of your miserable life unnoticeably disappeared )10/10! This game literally makes me wet. Just play it!
1;Although it has it's fair ammount of glitches the game is fun to play especially with friends. The biggest downfall for the game has to be the toxic community surrounding it which really isn't a fault of the game. Would recommend especially if it were on sale.
1;This game is loads of fun to play. Both killer and survivor. As a survivor main I get plenty of thrills when getting chased. The game is even better with friends! If you want you can hop into a private match with friends and screw around. Or you could go into a game as survivors and play together. Overall if you're a thrill seeker like me or want a game to have fun with friends this is a great game to play.
1;Apart from its toxic community the pallet looping the non existant stealth game and under and overpowered perks as well as items and add ons its quite good.Don't take this game seriously and you'll have a blat take it seriously and you're going to rage every game.
1;"""I absolutely love this game. It has flaws it can be frustrating but it always leaves you with hope. If you get killed who cares? Start another session! If you can't kill anyone play another game! The developers are actually active and constantly improving and I love them for that. I am horrible at this game and keep coming back for more. So if you're the killer and see """"dweezler"""" is a survivor just be easy on me... P.S. Just play with MissLucyX on Twitch."""
1;Game is pretty good. Fun for quite awhile but can get annoying at rank 1 killer/survivor cause people will use lame shit to win. Lots of different stuff to use to change up gameplay but too much DLC and a on of stuff for new players to unlock. if you dont buy DLC pretty hard to get perks some of which are the best for killers. Survivors main perks you kinda have from default characters.
1;Product received for free. great game better than when it started i remember the double pallet loops that used to exist and i do miss them however i believe it benefits many people that it is removed and believe that the devs are doing the greta job really fun game.
1;How to win as survivor Step 1 Get 3 other people to play with you.Step 2 All be Dwight and use murky reagents or darkest moonlightStep 3 Join a GameStep 4 Immediately upon starting the trial all go into the basement lockers.Step 5 Get found by killer and mercilessly killed.Step 6 See that the killer was Rank 1. GG(Updated 12/8/2018) Good luck if you're new
1;I was scared and a little disappointed at first. I gave this a second chance and I am completely hooked. Get it? Its not without balance issues occasional bugs and salty survivors. However its a blast to play and very rewarding for the time I have put in. I love this game
1;A very Fun horror experience for both the Killer and Survivor. For Killer it's the fun and Thrill of the Hunt that makes them fun. For the Survivor it's the Resilience and the will to survive that makes playing them fun. The game is still a little buggy with it's vaults and pallets (and hit detection) but otherwise it really is a fun experience.
1;This is still one of the best asymmetrical horror games that I have played so far. The game has its fair share of bugs here and there but nothing serious. It never gets boring and has an amazing replayability value.Edit Still pretty amazing with all the new killers that keep getting added even though I have stopped playing.
1;Other than the sweaty killers facecamping and tunneling its pretty fun. eat me if you're one of those people btw. It's really fun with friends and even solo play don't expect to win every game though and the learning curve takes a while. Progression system is great and mildly rewarding. In my opinion though it needs rewards for getting to new rank levels. 9/10 would recommend.
1;I've just transfered to pc from ps4 (been playing since 2017 on the ps4) the free week made me do it. PC is much more smoother an overall better experience. And I even grabbed the deal which includes Dead by Daylight &amp The Saw DLC! For just 12 a great deal! This game is great would recommend! One of the few games that make me stick around.
1;I'm sorry did you want to try this game?Connection errorConnection errorConnection errorHaven't gotten a chance to even play on this free weekend.Past that free weekend tho this game has been great fun and I hope all the bugs I hear ppl complaining about are fixed before I run into them.. )
1;"""Did you ever play games of Hide and Seek at night?Do you like Horror movies?Ever wanted to kill a group of defenceless campers?Well this game takes all of those things and (boy I hate this phrase) """"puts you in the drivers seat.""""I suppose I should have asked """"Have you ever wanted to be a defenceless camper sacrifiesd my a maniac to dark Gods?"""" but that sounds bad.Play it. It's fun."""
1;This game is fun but there has a nasty bug that ruin your effort. The game itself has bad progress save system. I lost my save file after the last patch. Everythings gone bloodpoint levels perks all gone. Not just me but happen to a lot of other players too.Edit. The bug has been fix. Status effect some perks has changed to make game balance. I'm feel like the game is polished now and the price drop too. If you looking for a game to play with ye mateys I recommended this game.
1;My review Gameplay 3.5/5 It's good Graphic 4.5/5 It's good Story 2.5/5 because It's not excite Music 3.5/5 I agree this soundtrack it's horror like i'm stuck in ForrestSocial in Game 1/5 because it's not okay it's have toxic player leaver player (I hate it)I give this game 3/5because have a new bug and cheater and toxic playerBut when New Killer Have Come it's fun
1;Product received for free. All around fun and addicting game to play. But i've just recently encountered people in the higher ranks (1 2 3) that can on your pc. I killed a higher rank survivor and my pc instantly blue screened. Every time it restarted it blue screened again and again. Please find these people DBD and get rid of them. This almost costed me a whole new motherboard.
1;A fantasic game used to rage a lot but later learned to just have fun. Learn to accept the bugs and have fun with them killer or survivor. If you dont learn to do such things you will never have fun and just quit. I understand that killer is frustrating but aim for improving and not 4 kills each match will do more good than you think. Dont be afraid to say what annoys you but if everything annoys you then look for another game. If you like team based horror survivor games totally recommend DBD.
1;Best Horor multiplayer game I ever play. It is better than Friday the 13 . I want to see jason in dead by daylight is for me very powerful killer and I want to fix the Freedy Krugger. You must buy this game because is so fun to play with friends. Rate 10/10
1;I personally like this game but then I played this game for 75 hours so what do I really know.Tho I enjoy this game I recommend you try this game once or twice or atleast see some gameplay/reviews. I had a free trial when dbd was on sale and I really enjoyed it and made my mind about nuying the game (of course I was interested in the game way before it was on free trial).I recommend this game but it might not be for everyone (I mean don't we all have our preferences).
1;This game is addictive. With headphones you become fully immersed for a night of jump scares. The game provides you with a variety of surviors and killers which makes every game different from the last. The developers are always adding items charatcters and mechanics to keep the game fresh. Payed full price and don't regret it at all.
1;i love this game. in most horror games it's singleplayer and even when there is multiplayer in a horror game it's mostly only coop and the killer is just an AI but in this game you can be the killer or the survivor if ur survivor someone else is the killer so you have to play against real people i would really recomend this game if you like horror games it definetly is worth the money(or you buy it on a sale like i did)
1;Although it still requires a lot of work to patch Bugs and Hacks there is still a lot of potential behind this game even after the amount of years it's been out.The developers also work hard to continue working and improving upon the games features and faults and haven't given up.The game isn't perfect and it's nowhere near it either but still a hell of a lot of fun to play with Friends.
1;Very fun game on both sides killer and survivor The rounds are pretty short most of the time There is no in game communication so you don't need to put up with the salty community before the game ends Sure you still face balancing issues and sometimes pretty long queue times for matchmaking. However the developers still listen to the community and show this game some love. Most other studios would release a sequel game so thumbs up for that.
1;I love getting pallet looped gen rush getting stunned getting blinded while picking up a survivor scratch marks disappearing for some reason even though i just saw where the survivor ran entity displeased trying to get to rank 1 killer for 10 hours only to fail because i keep getting matched with god like survivors decisive strikeWould recommend this game for everyone &lt 3
1;Awesome game tho the matchmaking need improvements.Also would be nice to have more relevant stuff from the movies like the original Freddy's song with the creepy girls voice just for the survivor to hear. Would be very nice also if leatherface do the dance macabre with his special power. Same hitting points but if you look he is actually doing his iconic dance.
1;This game may induce the saltiest of people to become so full of rage that they take it out on innocents may have made me so mad that I HAVE to get off a game but I cannot deny the hard work the Devs put in. They face so much crap from the very community that both praise and despise the game try their hardest to get things right and appease the community it's hard not to love them. The game itself always has enough draw to keep me coming back especially when friends are playing.
1;It may be never bug free but the devs are always working on them. Its the best horror game currently available and features some well known characters from horror movies. The community is mostly nice and often fun. Totally worth its money. I has some great events too which make me wanna come back to this game again and again.
1;Hide and go seek + freeze tag. Most of the community are good people. It's difficult to understand how to win when you first start. Keep playing until you get the hang of it. Great to play with friends.Edit Still one of the most enjoyable games I own (as of Nov 2018). The team is constantly making this game better. Totally enjoy it.
1;Has had it's ups and downs for me but when you starting playing absolutely EVERY noise scares you and it's a really cool experience even more so with friends! You get to introduce people to the game and let them be the scared ones and you can all laugh and have a great time. Even when you've played for a long time you will still get the jump scares and that rush when you're being chased. I love it.
1;A really fun game that requires a lot of teamwork.Obviously a lot more fun to play with your friends but also great to play by yourself to try and get better at the game.Some things need more work though like the lobbies being P2P and you being dependant on the internet connection of the killer. Also the anti cheat system needs some more.Great game to play try and get it while on sale.
1;The game is good but after 100 hours of play you understand that in it as in any other community game is not so ordinary (toxic). Comterative is not interesting as they usually all go to the discord and break the gameplay for this they are camped and then in the chat we see complaints about maniacs. But the game takes the atmosphere and I hope that the game will be engaged in the right direction.
1;The start of the game can be a bit challenging for new players and progression is pretty slow until you've put a decent chunk of time into the game. Lag is pretty common and can ruin games. Players with a lot of time invested can be pretty toxic.Even with these problems it's still a fun game. The learning curve is steep but once you've gotten the hang of it it's a lot of fun.Playing with friends highly recommended especially for newer people.
1;I would recommend this game specially if you get it on sale. The game itself is fairly simple and easy to understand but hard to master. It pitches 4 survivors against 1 killer in a randomly picked map. Survivors try to escape and the killer does what a killer does. Pros Ability to outplay other people is fun and encouraging.Many hours of play for relative little moneyUpdated regularly.Cons Lack of a proper Ranking systemSlightly lacking polish on non gamebreaking issues.
1;hello everyone i have a question. i resently upgraded my computer and i love playing this game but have not been able to play this game eversense i can run anyonther game no problem but this one will not run over 15fps i have a radion rx 560 and it utilises 100% of my gpu for some reason is there anything that i can do to make this game work because i have the right sestyem requirements to run it but somthings wrong and i realy want to play the game agin.
1;Very fun to play with your friends! u also can chop chop ur frens without feeling guilty and being hated !!The scary atmosphere the thriller and the thriump feeling when u are the only one survived at the end of the game are the B E S T!Very happy to purchased this game i never regreted it one second!!!
1;It's a great game especially if your into survival horror. I wish there was a way to stop the killers from camping that's really the only problem. Thankfully not many people do it. You also get new chapters every 3 months as well as cosmetics worth it!
1;It can be highly addicting and there will inevitably be some good rounds that make you push for more sadly the community is rather toxic and childish. Either side will basically flame or insult the other for no reason except to either or brag depending if they felt they did well or if they feel they got unfairly taken out. Basically play for yourself or play with some buddies there will be salt hopefully it doesnt bother you much and ruin the experience.
1;"""a fun and good game to play with friends it have some isues along the gaming course but i think the devs will rezolv them in due time ) well keep it up boys and girls P and uhmm maybe you bring some new killers to the game """" there are a loot of kilers in the horror movie's you can think of """" xD"""
1;When I bought this game over a year ago I dropped it after a few hours of playing. It just didn't feel right.Well after a friend made me play it again I realized that it really got better. I can't quite nail down what changed but I really love this game now. As long as you can handle salt in certain situations give this game a shot. Especially great when surviving with friends!
1;hate the matchmaking system and killer finding a lobby can take up to 30 mins (my exp) when season resets all the pros and noobs mix so its a bit unfair and alot of ppl like to Tbag toxic stuff etc but its fun playing the game either killer or survivor
1;This game has taken over my life and ruined many relationships of mine. i come home from my 12 hour job and just come home to ignore my girlfriend so i can play. This game will boil your blood and make you want to throw your pc out the window. no matter how times my blood gets boiled i cant stop playing. i have bags under my eyes from how much i play this and still this game boils your blood to the max.
1;This game may be a little buggy at times (Getting Better) but in my opinion those don't matter because the pros of this game are way more abundant than the cons. Lastly I rate this game a 8.5/10.Pros Great concept not pay to win in a sense overall good graphics a lot of options from clothes items and characters and much more!Cons A bit laggy depending on where the host is compared to you and a little buggy here and there.
1;Been keeping this game on my watchlist and well it delivered.I had pre ordered the game 2 months (risky i know) prior to it's release with a great amount of hype for the game but i was also worrying if it'd be what i'd expected or not.Turns out it was better than i expected.Definitely worth your money!
1;How to have fun in Dead By Daylight1 Relax it's only a game.2 If you can't relax because your fellow survivors are inept at surviving go Killer to shiv them.3 If you can't relax because survivors are being toxic and teabagging or looping you then go survivor to let of some steam.4 Repeat 'till you give up due to frustration 5 Jump back on tomorrow 'cause it's fun and addictive and you like the thrill of the hunt.6 Eventually vow to never play again.7 Play again8 Start steps 1 7 all over again.
1;After I spent 400 hours in this game with all the bugs and this toxic community I can just recommend this game it's awesome especially with friends but you're gonna rage sometimes. I don't really play Dbd anymore but I'm glad to see this game is still alive and even grows further. I have a lot of good memories with this game and I even met new people and made friends. I'm sure one day I will look at this game feeling nostalgia.
1;THIS GAME IS AWESOME. I highly recommend this game. If you're playing as survivor Just sacrifice help each other. If you're playing as Killer Learn strategy Chasing Hanging. Don't let your ego controls you this game not about win or lose. MAKING SCORE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.Don't be emotional this is just a game. Just enjoy it. Cheers D
1;You'll both love and hate this game its filled with BS that can make it stressful but it also has so many good things to keep you engaged if I had to recommend some of the DLCs i'd say get the halloween chapter leatherface and either curtain call or of flesh and mud the others arent really that necesary unless you want to play as the killers or survivors of each or need a specific perk from them.p.d. be prepared for salt in extreme quantities
1;One of the best games to play with your friends one of the worst to play by yourself. The overwhelming majority of the playerbase is mentally challenged toxic af overtly selfish arrogant stubborn straight up delusional. Easily the worst community out of any game I've ever played. Also the amount of bugs this game has is overwhelming at times. Addicting af so that's why I'm still playing.
1;"""""""Dead By Daylight"""" is definitely one of the best games I've ever played but it'll never be better than the Zelda games 3 At first I had some lagg problems then I figured out that if you change the graphic settings to low then the game works much more lagg free and the graphic settings difference isn't that big of a deal. It's also thrilling like EVERY time I play it I get jump scared and startled."""
1;Product received for free. This game is one of my favorites and will more than likely always will be (until it ends up dying in the future). Although it can get repetitive it's one of those games where if you like it you'll stick around with it. It's important to understand that you will be terrible at the game at first but after some practice you will gradually get better and increase in rank. Community can get toxic at times but you just gotta lift your chin and not give af. Best of luck!
1;Very beautiful game but every time there is an update it becomes harder. I think the developers trying to satisfy the killer only to play the game and don't think about survivors. Also there are no mods like other games. other games change a little bit every period and they add more things. For example create a mod in kill your friend that let 5 survivors join the game but change the number of perks and gens. Or try 2 killers and 6 8 survivors xD of course this an example.
1;this game is super fun from runing for your life to mowing down people with a chain saw. but it has problems that the game has really hinders it its hard for new people to get into to game. hard loops can really put a dent in you fun. and trying to win agents a SWF group is like pulling off a finger nail.I give the game a 8.5/10 if the devs fis the problems with the game that will be a 9.5/102018 05 21
1;Pretty fun with a good group of freinds but i think adding more new and unique content could help a bit. Having one gamemode can make the game a little stale from time to time. If you have a reliable group of friends to get this with then def pick it up but if not maybe just wait until it goes on sale then snatch it.
1;Once you learn how to play the game and get some good friends to play with this game is really fun. I have been playing this game non stop for weeks and am not even close to bored. I highly reccomend this game and for the current price it is a major steal.
1;This game is very fun to play with friends. Dead by Daylight is plagued with some balance issues (it's an asymetrical PvP game after all) but the developers are constantly updating the game with new content and balancing. I'd recommend it.But please for the sake of your team watch the tutorials.
1;"""Everything about this game is solid except for the """"strategies"""" in this game are very questionable. Having the Devs comfirm camping and slugging a validative strategy is comeplete BS. Just having a normal day then 5 games in a row where you get face camped of slugged. Its fun but until that happens its not. But then you learn how to be toxic and all is fine."""
1;Great game. Feels heavily unbalanced when you first start playing but becomes a true addiction after you get a handle on things. This is not a game you can learn by watching videos and streams. The more experience you get the better you will become. Absolutely engaging and enjoyable gameplay. Especially when you go it alone and try to be a solo survivor. Makes the game what it really is meant to be a horror film experience.
1;While far from perfect this game is really addictive for fans of slasher movies as it gives a good immersion and some really tense and stressfull play sessions. I howerver must warn that the learning curve is steep and whatever side you will choose your opponent will be merciless.
1;A really fun game. Either play as a nigh unstoppable killer or team up with other player to try survive. People say that the game is fairly killer sided at the moment but in a game where teh killer is suppose to be powerful I feel like it is more balanced than it has been since the game started.
1;Great game very active devs who have really brought in some amazing improvements since they bought the rights to the game.There is a constant stream of new content including new skins maps and characters which keep things fresh and interesting.There are regular news updates keeping the community posted on game developments.Balance is getting better and better too moving away from where it was over the last year with a total bias towards the survivor.Strongly reccomend.
1;It's like a love and hate relationship D the game is fun especially as SWF 3 but then again some Bugs make you hate the game for a moment or if you get camped even tho the killer dont get any emblem points for it anymore i recommend it anyways tho since its alot of fun
1;I've been playing this game now for around 30 hours and I have to say it's a great game! I've always been a fan of horror movies etc so this is the perfect game. Sometimes the lobby is kinda messed up but I don't really care. I have a lot of fun playing it as survivor with friends and I guess I'll play it a lot more!!EDIT after some more hours I also started playing as killer! it's actually pretty funny when you get the hang of it! sadly you often have to wait 10 15min to find a lobby...
1;Sneaking around evading killers repairing generators with other survivors to escape... Sure there may be a lot of toxicity in the community and it's not glitch free but there's something about this game that brings me back constantly. The developers while not perfect are always adding new content and doing a pretty decent job updating the game.
1;You should definitely get this game. It literally took me less than three days to completely understand all the perks and grasp the concept of this game and it took me a long time to master it but it was definitely a balanced and fun experience that they have provided for new players. Get it no regrets.
1;Dead by Daylight is a very addictive classic horror game where 4 players have to try to scape from a killer who's also a player. You can upgrade your player and make it better with new skills to avoid being captured or helping the others. For me is a very good game to play with friends. A lot of fun guaranteed!!I definely love this game
1;Amazing game the grapichs are pretty good and the community is awesome.There might be some toxic killers that face camp but you and your friends will defidentally find something out.Its very fun to play by yourself. But Playing with friends are even better!
1;This game is good but if you like killer gameplay don't bother if you have a bad connection. People will just go crazy in end game chat. All in all this game still needs lot of stuff rewards for ranking seasons dedicated servers (announced for 2019 we'll change review then).If you're a hardcore slasher movies fan this is your graal.

1;For me who has put over 450 hours into this game I can thouroughly say I have enjoyed it and can highly recommend it. This game is fun and exciting and will get your blood pumping whether you are getting chased by the killer performing a risky rescue or are the last survivor standing. Highly recommended. DEdit Still playing this game loving all the new DLC's they keep making for this game! Pretty good job so far keep up the good work! c
1;I really believe the dlc prices need ajustment. 7 dollars for a character and a map local is dumb. i can expect 3 to 5 dollars but 20 for one is getting ourtragous. and now that new killers are coming its making it more of an advantage toward the new killers and not the survivors
1;Absolutely love this game it's a great game and I enjoy it but after you play it for around 1 3 months you start to feel bored and sick of playing it you will find that its the same thing on and on and on because theres only 2 gamemodes. the devs should add more gamemodes. But overall its a very cool game.
1;Dead By Daylight is one of those kind of games that you hate and keep saying i wont play this again but you still come back for more of it.Its a fun game to play with freinds in (SWF) Survive with friends og in (KLF) Kill Your FriendsYou can get a lot of hours well spent in DBD
1;This game is great and has loads of maps and characters. if you like games that you can choose this game is for you it is a horror and i love horror games you have to fix 4 gens and the killer kills 4 survivors. I hope you have fun in the game and i really enjoyed it.
1;"""MAN. This game be ing scary as ing addicting as hell but these ing killers are annoying as Get me on the hook aight? BUT DON'T ING MAKE ANNOYING SOUNDS WHEN CATCHING ME JUST FOR A QUICK """"In your face!"""" Moment. Good game. 10/10. Though I'd prefer cocaine."""
1;Watch as your faith in humanity disolves. Your a good killer? We'll troll you! You want to play a decent game? Nah man I'll facecamp you till you die! Trying to be a recpectable killer? Dude were just guna use infinites troll and call you a camper after! 10/10 would rage again.
1;Really fun game to play as you carry your fat es off hooks or play alone and murder fools in dark forests. Constant patches and fixes improve the game not to mention the content updates with dank skins for survivors and killers. Totally recommend this game.
1;Intense fun and addictingGreat game Toxic community annoying devMaking a lobby as a killer almost takes an hour and sometimes get bullied by the survivor with flashlight and suchjoining lobby as a survivor kinda sucks sometime since i always get a lobby with 800+ ping and lagswitcherAnd Pretty good job so far
1;I have pretty much grown older with this game.You can either take this game as fun or as frustrating you can t say the others do it. I had fun a lot more times than i was frustrated. Although developers may not be the most beloved bunch they keep trying to make the game fun for everyone. And i hope it keeps on being amazing even in the future
1;This game is pretty good fun on both sides but not always. I usually always play the killer and most of the time it's easy and fun but for me being a survivor is hard maybe because I'm at being one or the game is unbalanced but overall this game is pretty good and a few DLCs are worth buying.
1;Right now it s to buggy Worst of all there is no matchmakin/queueing &amp if you find sth the killer leaves...game has potential but is not worth 20 buck at the moment /_________________Update 22.11.18 Still has some bugs but it is a fun game to playcon to unluck full content you need to buy the dlcs in general toxic community
1;Really good game. The only thing I have to say is that there are currenlty some notification bugs. When you are Killer the game is not showing you what gen was completed &amp not being able to see where the doors are. This only happens in some games usually every 4 5 games in. Other than that the game is really good. The community not so much. Many Entitled Survivors &amp Killers not a lot of people get along but there are some games where you do.
1;Great game.Nice graphics cool concept haunting music and a lot of fun with friends. Playing alone is rather boring as survivor but as killer one has a lot of fun. The price is fair. Would prefer better support and service for reports and maybe a feedback.
1;Been playing this game for about 2 years the updates in the last year and the devs buying the rights from the publishers have really made this game a lot more fun an enjoyable. 4v1 asymmetric horror gameplay has never been as enjoyable. Definitely recommend especially if you like Horror!
1;I got this game from my son for Christmas. Had no idea i would be addicted in a day . The game is action packed makes me scream leaves me wanting to play more after each round. It may be repeating over and over the same actions but it so fun to see the out come of each match. would highly recomend this game.
1;After gettin' rank 1 i have done my biggest achievement in the game... so i am no longer playing it until new matchmaking system comes out cuse it tase so long to get in actual game. Overall the game is cool and lovely but some people like ochido and toxic stuff make community wasted BTW toxicness doesn't work with me (i become even more toxic if someone being toxic in my lobby so...).
1;Dead by Daylight is a game that captured and ensared me the moment I got through my first game. It's a unique beautiful and well thought of game that honestly has a pretty bad reputation.This game as a lot of potential to become amazing and I can't wait to see where it goes.
1;Aside from having a community where a decent chunk of players will find anything to harass you about the game in itself is greatm and the developers (from my casual gamer eyes at least) are doing well in getting new content out and trying to balance it as well as possible. Highly recommended as I've yet to play a game like it the atmosphere the tidbits of lore and the mix of original and well known characters are a few of it's great aspects.
1;You're a fan of horror? You like mindgames? You like salt? Here's THE game you need my friend! Play agaisnt a bunch of people or with a bunch of people to ruin another person's day. No but seriously this game is really cool play well and is pretty addictive when you begin to really try your best.
1;Two of us left I am injured Using the bond perk notice that the other teammate is hiding in a closet by the hatch Teammate is waiting for me to die so he can escape Spam the enter closet button hoping killer sees Killer knocks me out Killer opens closet and takes guy out Killer hangs guy on hook Guy dies I start spinning in circles on the floor Killer picks me up Killer carries me to hatch I escaped
1;Is is balanced? Heck no! Are people generally stupid enough on the opposing team for you to win anyway? Yeah. Is winnign against brain dead noobs fun? Kinda. If you don't feel bad about bullying the very dullest knives in the drawer this is the game for you.
1;Honetly this game is great. It really is especially if you're a fan of horror movies or creepypastas. Playing as survivor has this certain thrill of running away from something you truly fear (unless its freddy krueger ironically) and playing as the killer grants you the satisfaction of hunting. The game is constantly adding new characters and maps and the community can be a fun toxic happy place for horrorcore fans.
1;I really love this game!... but i'm so that people are take me of the hook in front of the killer and farm points that way! seriously. you can't do about it... at lest make it so you can choose to get ''take off'' or not. hold shift or something like when you dont want to get healed! its not that hard!because this is t! developer! i played you game some much... please make this for me!
1;(Pretty good job so far)In all seriousness this game does have it's flaws but the flaws are pretty much a part of the charm of this game and the game is great fun. Had some of the most fun times just playing this even when fighting with friends in matches.
1;Does all the gens hooks saves everyone opens up gates heals people destroys totems teamates hide in a closet you get downed you get put on a hook your teamates leave you and say thx for carry &lt 3tbh this game is but I still like itps. PLAY WITH FRIENDS (but i dont have any so)
1;Regardless of the hate DBD gets its honestly a great game. Don't let the reviews change your mind if you're thinking of buying it. It's an asymmetrical horror if you feel the game is unbalanced IT ISThe devs do an awesome job at listening to and including the community and they are constantly putting new content into this game and trying to iron out imperfections.
1;Great game with unique 1v4 mechanic. If you are a beginner and playing as survivor dont be dissappointent if you are getting killed or dont make it out alive in your first few rounds. It takes awhile to get familiar with the whole game setup like in every PvP game. In case you are struggling against the killers i recommend to play 2 or 3 rounds AS killer to recognize what the killerpart is able to do so and especially what hurts him.So dont be mad just hit that play again!
1;+ Satisfying level progression. Some fun gameplay elements (chases jukes). Really fun with friends. Toxic Community. Questionable gameplay mechanics (camping crutch perks). Devs that keeps changing their ideas for this game.At this price this game is worth it.
1;It's awesome that players can play either as a survivor or as a killer. Made my heart beat faster nicely with the soundtrack too. The fact that i'm running from a killer that isn't NPC is much more exciting and vice versa. Though the game does increase the saltiness of a person. Be it a random or yourself i recommend preparing some popcorns when playing this. )
1;I absolutly love this game. It is great for playing with friends but also gives the same experience while playing alone also. Everybody can have there own experience thorugh the wide variety of characters to choose from and show style with the many customizations provided.
1;"""Playing survivor is really fun if you have at least one friend to play with while killer allows for a kind of """"single player"""" experience. There's no dedicated servers which means you won't have to deal with outages but also comes with the issue of connecting to some asshound in central Turkmenistan decided the play killer and you don't notice your ping of 3 million until the game starts.I would happily frick 3 of the killers you figure out which ones"""
1;Fixed the matchmaking and the issues with the dropped off from the lobby.The ping of the room/server can also be viewed from the lobby. Hope thay fix more network connection issues and create a dedicated server for players. Game is slowly improving Good Job Starbreeze Studios!
1;"""Different experience as survivor / killer.You get the occasional player being salty because you don't play the """"way you're supposed to """" which usually means not giving them every advantage as survivor if you're killer or making the killer chase you for too long. But it's fun especially with friends."""
1;Pros Can easily play a ton of hours Every match plays a bit differently Good varietry of killers Lots of perks to customize your playstyleCons Higher ranks have long queues Players can be toxic sometimes Devs are either slow or dont care to fix many core gameplay issues Overall worth it since the game is constantly updated devs like to communicate with the players about their progress on the game
1;I like this game too mutch but the only think I dont like are the killers who are campers... campers are very needless and they give a lot tryhard ' ' (but how we know in all games there are these things).So its fine (for me) I have fun inthe same way and with friends its better 3
1;"""Challenging game for starters prepare to invest time. The learning curve can be quite high. More fun with friends via voice com. Can be frustrating at times for solo players due to obvious advantages in survival with friends. Advise play both killer and survivor it will help your ability to play """"good"""" a lot."""
1;Great game. One of my most played ones. Did have serious issues with it crashing constantly on me (to do with the game engine they use) but after reinstalling my graphics card drivers from scratch and then fiddling with some settings on it I seem to have mailed the problem (I hated that it looked like I was Dcing when the game was crashing on me)
1;updated review ) after playing a fair few more hours on this game i have to say i love to play it i often play solo in groups with random survs but have played with friends both are fun you do need to put hours into the game to get better and unlock perks playing killer is also alot of fun when it comes to dwights XD they deffo love lockers just make sure you keep a eye out for the hiding claudettes x great game loads of fun
1;In this game you can Run in circles Be considered toxic for doing objective Feel like you are in an abusive relationship Stare in the beautiful eyes of Bubba for what feels like eternity Lose some additional hope as your teammates spend their time crouching from locker to locker Mindgame yourself beacuse you have 200 IQ Run in circles a little bit more
1;This game is funny only if u play killer or at lower ranks (between 20 and 10). Survivors are really crappy due to multiple nerfs and unfixed bugs. Tunneling and camping are real issues which make the game really unfun for survivor.But i recommand it since they added Michael Myers &lt 3
1;Even though this game can be a bit buggy at times I can tell the developers try their hardest with this game and trying to keep their community always interested in this game with new content this being one of my first games of these types I really enjoy playing this game for the most part.
1;Dead by Daylight has come a long way since its release. New killers and survivors continue to be added with more on the roadmap ahead. Game balance continues to be dialed in and tweaked generally for the better. The early days were far from balanced and I'm glad I gave the game another shot. There are still some trolly try hards and survive with friends still provides a distinct advantage but its still enjoyable more often than not.
1;so far i love this game i dont have too many hours but i got enough but as of right now i cant even get past the loading screen at the very beginning all it says and stays saying installation complete and stays that way no matter what i do. Please do need a patch or somethign to be able to keep playing. Love the game do play
1;Fun game. The toxic is abit boring but if you have played CoD or LoL you are bulletproof. The toxic as many complains about can't be compaired haha. So far im having a blast. SWF is really fun (getting camped or tunneled is annoying) but otherwise I recommend this game!
1;I absolutely love this game. It is so much fun and with all of the random people playing it adds a nice element of suprise. It is even more fun to play as a group of friends and troll the killer or even to kill your friends. The onlyt warning I have is to not take the game seriously. Too many people do this especially at high ranks. This just leads to saltiness and an unenjoyable game. Otherwise I highly recomend this game to anyone.
1;This is a very fun game but it can be very frustrating when toxic people are in your game. the community is quite good. the game is still developping and growing of course there some bugs but they are still working on those things. I really recommand this game its easy to play but can be very hard to master!
1;The Devs have finally taken steps toward balancing the game properly. The game always has some new game breaking bug whenever a major update releases but you stay anyway. This game is an abusive relationship that you just can't bring yourself to leave.
1;Whether you love getting camped looped around or just love horror games this game is just for you. Terrible community facecampers tunnelers never ending loops and others.But! The game itself is a masterpiece. Never played a more exiting one.Buy. This.
1;A really addictive game! Developers make new content every season and they work really hard to balance the game and hear out the community.The down side is this community can be down right toxic. But I met a lot of friends here that I'm happy to keep. There is still some bugs and stuff but that's what gives content to montages on YT and they are great! Recommend you to watch them too.8.5/10
1;Gonna play killer? Hope you're ready to be tea bagged at every window and blinded everytime you pick someone up then flamed for camping even though you never hooked someone. Not your style? Try survivor! An exciting round of the killer finding you within 3 femtoseconds and hooking you to face camp you until dead while your team runs in circles doing jack 10/10 would recomend.
1;i for real thought this game was going to be big but after they added the new killer i wanna kms cuz that b fast asf so please nerf before i do it and add guns to the game cuz survivors need at least something to defend with with a lot of love carlos &lt 3
1;Dead by Daylight is a cancers pile of 85% of the time you get some russain streaming tryhard who slugs camps tunnels and just in general is really sweaty can't even have fun. Playing as killer is way more fun cause you can be the nice guy or if you like being a you can do that too i guess. anyway overall great game don't waste your money on it go play with your wiener instead oh it also suck sweaty testicels
1;Love the game. Even with the toxic community unbalanced killers/survivors perks and bugs. Love the fact that Developers listen to their Community and do their best to balance the game. A lot of players complain about this but keep in mid that it requires a lot to fix some issues and even more with balancing both sides. Still like i mentioned I LOVE THE GAME!
1;Final review.This game is a good experience for those with friends that enjoy competitive games. It is good solo but less so. Highly recommend getting a friend or more to play this with unless you plan to painfully learn to play killer. Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Replayability 8/10
1;really fun game would definitely recommend it it can be tilting to play sometimes but the concept is outstanding there is some glitches but its not tthat bad the upgrade system is so unique and the perks are also great. there is also constant updates and events so it almost never gets old. tho its a bit annoying that you need to buy dlc's to get some of the killers and survivors but its not a must to have all the dlc's.
1;Product received for free. Very fun game as long as the killer plays fair and teamates actually help you and work together. Sometimes killers camp and or use lag switch and it can be very annoying and teamates sometimes dont care about saving you as long as they escape but overall the game is really fun has cool perks and characters featuring some licensed killers like Michael myers and freddy Kruger and possibly more in the future. I love this game and met some really good friends on here.
1;This game has come a long way. It still has its bugs a flaws here and there but the devs have really stepped their game up with this dlc and the balancing. I can say without a doubt that this game is a lot better than it used to be. Im excited to see what comes in the future and how they move the game forward.
1;I think it has alot of bugs and glitches that are pretty annoying to play with.There are also a very nice system with perks bloodpoints offerings items and add ons that is very unique.i would happily reccomend this to anyone who has any sort of patience because this is a game where you grind (ALOT)
1;After 400 hours of playing this game i still find joy in it whether I play it alone of with friends. Not to mention the fact that the developers of this game are still pumping out content and probably will continue to do so Makes this game a worthwhile investment.This review is mainly written out of perspective of a survivor player I do not play killer at all so I can't testify for the enjoyment of playing that role
1;I got this game a while ago and it's really great to see how it has grown.To be honest a few years ago it started getting boring. However that is not to say that happens now. The devs are doing a great job at making the game fun and enjoyable for everyone and with new killers and survivors every couple of months the game stays fresh and exciting.I would very much recommend this to people.
1;Great game plenty of variety in playstyles and perks which keep the game fresh and interesting. Although the community at times can be annoying and the servers laggy the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Just make sure not to take toxic words to heart and keep in mind that at the end of the day it really is just a game and you have plenty of fun!
1;This is my favourite game ive ever played i started playing during when it first came out on xbox.but i first saw it the week it came out and instantly loved it watched for 2 years wanting it finally got it and i loved it!best game i have ever played there are bugs and game mechanics that need to be fixed but i think its sill amazing.
1;i absolutely love Dead by Daylight... its fun to play with freinds or randoms but there is 1 thing that ive been wondering if anyones had the same problem... sometimes when I try to enter a lobby as a survivor it will jusk keep the loading... you cant exit out of the game or cancel finding a lobby. If so please comment if you've heard or seen anything about this glitch.
1;Product received for free. As someone who isnt a big lover of horror games this is a pleasent surprise!Super simple in terms of game play...Fix generators dont die escape!Gives you a nice little adrenaline boost when you're opening a gate too.Would recommend D
1;"""If you like horror type games but were curious about how both sides of the coin were this game might be for you. Super fun for solo play as the killer or 4 player group play as survivors. Both sides require quick thinking and it constantly keeps you on your toes. The only slight downside is that survivors can all be grouped up in """"survive with friends"""". For new killers it can be hard to fight against people who are able to talk with one another(there is no voice chat in game)."""
1;Dead by Daylight is a fun game and all but the amount of bugs and imbalances in the game sometimes ruins the DBD Experience... Not to mention that they dont have dedicated servers until 2019. But despite of all that its still fun I recommend you get it...
1;As a killer this games great just faceroll your way to victory fun but a little too easymode for me. Great if your a psychopath / sociopath irl?As a survivor however hard mode sets in and things start getting fun the cooperative aspects of this role are great espescially if you enjoy helping or rescuing others from iminent death.
1;Dead by Daylight is best survivor horror game and i like this game so much because of great graphics awesome sound effects and different types of killers survivors and maps. Anyone who wants to play survival horror game you can go for Dead by Daylight.
1;It is really funny but at the same time sometimes really frustrating when you can't escape from a killer. Some killers really aren't funny to play against or even the people behind the characters are sometimes really just toxic.Overall I love it thou and love playing it.
1;It's a pretty decent game with friends you can have some great moments yeah its frustrating to master but thats what makes it fun theres no rush to be good and i think its a great game with friends alone may be more tough but in the end its worth its money
1;Common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl) a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater where it is the main mineral constituent the open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz.) of solids per liter a salinity of 3.5%. Salt is essential for animal life and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes.
1;One of the best games I have ever played.The best part of it is you can either be the popular kid and play with your friends mess around or you can slaughter everyone as a killer and still have fun.This game balances the fun when your lonely or when you are social.
1;Pretty good job so far. Kappa. In all seriousness this game is fun. Despite it's bugs none of them are gamebreaking and its stupid funny 90% of the time especially with the current bug of sliding around almost t posing after throwing a pallet. Def more fun with someone though.
1;first of all the game music is awesome. i give 2 thumbs up for the music.game mechanic and gameplay somehow is fun both the survivor and killer with the simplicity of GUI and gameplay mechanic.lack of multiplayer playability and often need to close the game by force maybe will be solved on early 2019 by dedicated server.its worthed the price.
1;A game where you can sate your daily horror needs and test your resolve to toxicity. If you are a fan of horror games and want to become immune to toxicity then this game is for you. The devs did a pretty good job so far after all.EDIT Also as a con you WILL be bullied for trying out new things. Train with your sanity and saltiness under control and prepare yourselves for players who have admirable skills but despicable attitudes.
1;Lobby jumping simulator 2016 10/10EDIT The game now has the option to play with friends as survivor but is so unbalanced that is annoying to play... You enter the lobby with all your lvl 10 friends and the killer is lvl 50 with all rare perks. Unfair br&gt EDIT The game is more playable now but some random crashes still occurEDIT This is the only game I ever seen that have 2 lobbies before the game these devs doesn't know what they are doing
1;I knew this game from watching 2Bro. Entertainment's Dead by Daylight gameplays and they got me hooked. I'm glad that dedicated servers are coming up soon this year because the matching system isn't really good now. People disconnecting left and right from high ping or sudden lagness in game really ruins the match. Overall this game is most fun when surviving with friends but it's also fun surviving with randoms (provided they are not toxic).
1;Love this game Literally play it everyday and just fun and unique in my opinion. For sure check out videos of it / twitch and see if you like it! But i can say for myself i've gotten multiply people into the game! Plus it always goes on sale for $10 and totally is worth it!
1;it is a nice game but players are tryhards 90% being camped or friends who ignores you so the game not worth playing bcz of the players themselfs but if you want to play with your friends it will be so fun (bcz if u teamwork u can somehow deal with it)so if you have friends who will play with you then this game is so goodotherwise don't u will be facing tryhards and no teamwork team ( there is no voice chat )have a nice day
1;good game I love playing it.the gameplay is awesome and a very pleasant game in general. The game is fun to play and simple so you'll get the hang of it in a while. There is a bunch of characters to choose from and when you think the character starts to be a high level you can just start a new one. )
1;Figured it was time to review after all the free weekend reviews. The game is AMAZING. Both killer and survivor have a steep learning curve. If you can't handle winning every game this isn't for you. I say that as a survivor main who has reached rank 1 and I do not win every time by any means A LOT of losing happened along the way. I can see how it isn't for everyone try it and see for yourself.
1;THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC AND I AM VERY EXCITED FOR NEW THINGS TO COME KILLERS MAPS AND SURVIVERS 10000000000000% RECOMMENDED BROOOO THIS IS SUCH A GREAT GAME FELL DONE DEVS WELLDONE.. ANYWAYs THANKS FOR READING I BET NO ONES GONNA READ THIS BUT WHO CARES OK BYEEE!!! ... BUY THE FREAKIN GAME!!!!! (WHISPERED)
1;"""Fantasic game! I have around 150 hrs atm and I see many more coming soon! It's fun solo or with friends. Community can be slightly toxic and there are hidden """"rules"""" that if you break you may get flamed in chat. Play to have fun and you're guaranteed to have it!Dedicated servers are announced for Summer 2019 so It's be even better then."""
1;Its a fun game to play with friends the graphics are great and the game is intense. It might be a bit hard in the beggining but once you learn some tricks and get the right perks the game can be extremely funny with a lot of fails or awsome momments. I have had this game for a long time and can easily say it is only getting better with more dlc and way fewer bugs than it used to have.
1;"""Incredibly fun game to play whether you like chasing and hunting down survivors or you live by the code of """"No man gets left behind"""". Great game for teamwork and strategy each killer with their various perks implements new and different survivor strategies that change how you play and approach each round. Dwight's my main him and his sexy trackies and socks. Damn.11/10 would always play again.Some would say it's a pretty good job so far! D"""
1;I was hesistant to get this game at first because I couldn't quite understand what makes it so popular. Tried it for the first time on a free weekend and instantly fell in love. The game really captures the essence of being a hopeless survivor (when playing alone) or a brutal killer. Each killer has variety and a unique identity that defines them. Overall this game is engaging and addicting even if the community can be toxic at times.
1;it's really good to play with friends and this game make you feel adrenalin all time ) ... look at the killers .. love it but the cons .. camping killers can ruin the experience and some teammates can farm of you while leaving you stranded to die ... erww .. nothing is perfect )
1;Dead by Daylight is not a game about a killer hunting survivors. It is a zoo keeper sim. You can play an angry zoo keeper or one of 4 monkeys trying to destroy all the zoo equipment. The protagonists of the game are the killers. The horrible antagonists are the survivors.Rules of the zoo Use DS or abuse a lightsabre and the zoo keeper will stay at your monkey cage to make sure you dont escape the zoo.
1;This game is considered a horror game but not because the game is scary...It's because the community is so f***ing toxic its horrendous.Still its addictive and its fun and I wouldn't change it for anything....Game is super tilted towards killers tho. Survivors have it rough.
1;Yes Yes Yes.Dbd is an awesome game. Yet there are so many things wrong with it. Dbd is like the sexy hot girlfriend who you love to but everything else in the relationship drives you bat crazy. Weird analogy but if you've taken the time to really stick your fingers into Dbd you'll understand what i mean.Great party game with friends Or a great way to blow off some steam playing as a killer.
1;Has good and bad parts but mostly good. The problems lie in the player base and can only be fixed with better people playing. If you are a person who gets mad at games easily then this is not a game for you. If you are a person looking for a fun hide and seek game then I whole heartedly recomend it.
1;Product received for free. People say its a budget Friday the 13th it isnt its very adrenaline boosting and there are no jumpscares for jumpy and scaredy people like me. There is a heartbeat when the killer is near you but only rarely can you not hear it you hear music when the killer is near you and will NOT get jumpscared. Playing as a killer is really fun and overall I think this game is worth it
1;The community is toxic but the game is very addictive. Play as your favourite killer or survivor! There is even famous killers like Michael Myers Freddy Krueger and the pig from saw. New characters and outfits are released quite often. I LOVE THIS GAME JUST BUY IT!!!
1;"""This game is physically frustrating. The amount of RNG and just BS that happens in this game is absurd.You see the mechanics and you can feel a progression of play but it being left as a """"party game"""" such as mario party with random unfun elements makes the game very """"toxic.""""Still I continue to come back to this game for the Killers they have and the chases and games that are good. It is a lot of fun to play but you do definitely need to take a break or your hair will fall out."""
1;DbD is one of the best gaming surprises I've ever had. Not because I didn't know about the game but because I've been dismissing it for the past 2 years thinking it wasn't for me.After playing the Free weekend for almost 30 hours I immediatly got the Halloween ed. and Leatherface.Now I'm obsessed with a game I never thought I would enjoy.
1;I dont'like when we have to pay for the extra DLC content where these guys have an upper hand and we all F**king die.I was about to buy this game as i really liked the game in the free weakend. But when I saw this DLC should be paid instead of working ur way up. I turned down Good Bye.Updated But I still Like this game its being refined now
1;Really fun game. though there's one thing I'd like to add. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends this one's for you just beware of the toxicity of some of the people in the game. The community can get a little toxic but the majority of them are nice fun people.
1;so i have had this game for over a year now (700 hours at time of review) and honestly the game is far from perfect but i love this game they add new characters alot and while some of the community is toxic its overall a fun time. there are some scummy players for sure but honestly thats with any game thats online so nothing new here. killer is really fun when you start but after a while it becomes running in circle simulator which you will understand after playing for a bit. 7/10 for sure
1;This is a really fun game to play with friends or by yourself i still get scared when the heart rate increases knowing that the killer is lurking waiting for me. I think most people who enjoy horror games or movies will enjoy this watch some gameplay videos first to see if it's the kind of game for you.
1;I LOVE dead by daylight. It is a fun game to salt around in or be serious. Yes there are bugs yes there are salty and toxic players yes there is terrible customer service. But you know what? That's what makes the dead by daylight community so special. But if you can't tolerate it then uninstall and complain in the reviews see how much I care about your problems.
1;good game but If Devs see (doubt it) I would like to say a few things Firstly the Pig either needs a buff or to be removed and to others if versing The nightmare (Freddy kruger) dont try to escape as he is o.p and needs a nerf because there is no way to escape him other than brute force teaming him.
1;Fairly new to the game but enjoying it immensly. Diverse roster of killers keeps the game fresh and the leveling isn't too harsh making perk unlocks not too grind like. There are a lot of characters within both Survivors and Killers to level so still plenty of work to put into the game though.
1;this game is like drinking glass. yeah it hurts like hell and why the hell would you eat glass like youre the grinch? HOWEVER call me and my friends the grinch because we come back to this game every single day for more tilt. i hope it continues to add juicy content because thats whats keeping players around. (
1;The Game is really entertaining &amp addictive even the game is repetitive and low on mechanics!Anyway I wish the DEVS add more spice to the game like finding parts changing the view of survivor game modes and Survivor have a unique skills/traits balancing of the game and etc...The Game has a lot of Potentials D but lack of gameplay contents!
1;Pretty good job my br&gt You do all gensThe killer is on you the whole game while teammates crouching in cornersThe doors are open and they just wait in the gates for the killer while you're on a hookToxic people.. But I'm still playing it.. Why? helpmeDoing gens you?
1;So this game is far from perfect but that does not ruin it at all. There is something just so fun about this game no matter if you play survivor or killer. The dev's have the communities intrest in mind with each patch even if it really does not seem like it....ever. Plus with how often it drops new killers/survivors the game never gets the chance to get stale. Ramblings aside I would say this game is a solid 7/10 with the true potential to be a 10.
1;"""If you have never played this game Do Not Start. This game will change you and the way you see your fellow men. I've seen bugs in this game no one should ever have to witness. The dumbest and most toxic community I've ever seen and debs who """"did a pretty good job"""" in you've never touched this game stay away for the rest of us. 4/5 gotta love the devil if it loves you back."""
1;I highly recommend this game but like with every other game there are problems. Personally I would love to see a voice chat the survivors can join in to talk and player hit boxes need to be improved. The game has gotten worse as it has progressed but it isnt aweful and I still love to play it. I would also like to see more emotes for survivors and maybe some for killers too. Over all this game is pretty good and definetly has a lot of potential.
1;Finally hit my 100 hr it is a good game.However this type of game may not suit for anyone it take time to know about the game and most importantly you need to have great temper management.Anyways it is worth for a try if there are sales throw you tap on it and have a taste!Enjoy the game and be nice to others! D
1;EDIT They have done so much to rebalance this game. There are still a few issues I feel like here should be one or two more pallets but now when I play as The Pig or The Trapper it's not completely useless. Killer gameplay is less frustrating and survivor gameplay makes me sweat on occasion.Good job devs!
1;pretty nice game and the most important thing worths it's money.Really worth.THe single problem i met is that the FPS in High quality are meh and on ultra high i have like 10 fps but on medium 90.So the devs should better optimize it.But it is a really nice game to play
1;Basically it is a cat and mouse gameI personally like the learn curve also this game allows u to level up pretty quickly since the 2.0.0 update.also its not pay2win since u can also play ur way thru most of the non copyrighted chars thru the shards nowa dbd survivor
1;"""This game is great but the community is as worse as LoL/csgo/overwatch community...I recommend you to put your """"Comment Permissions"""" Friends only because you will get tons of toxic comments to your profile when you out smart other players in this game. You can check my profile for examples.You can only talk to others at the end of the game or at the game lobby. (not with the killer though)4/5TL DR great game &gt 4/5 but put your profile private"""
1;I played Advance Wars religiously for many many years and have been waiting for something to scratch that itch for so very long now.Wargroove delivers everything I wanted so well along with so many extras like functional online play and the awesome campaign creator. (really looking forward to what the community can make)If you ever liked Fire Emblem Advance wars or anything they inspired you need this game.Here's hoping to religiously playing Wargroove for just as long!
1;I love Wallpaper Engine. It is very addicting. I especially love the aquarium and the camel on the desert and the barbarian on the desert at night... and many others. The music and dance wallpapers are fun to watch but too distracting for working. There are marvelous creative wonders that show what the future of computer entertainment holds. The basically unlimited expression across cultures provides hope for the future.
1;This is a very good application for basically nothing just 4 dollars and with that you can get a huge selection of wallpapers thanks to the steam workshop. Also I have always found wallpapers that move to be the coolest so I mean this is 100% worth it. I need to add this first of all with the purchase wallpapers that you can get I would suggest not getting those because when I purchased it it wouldn't let me use the wallpaper so I just wouldn't get those but other then that I would get this app

1;At the time of posting this review my game time was/is 666 hrs. That says alot not just in the short time that I have owned the game but the fact that I have basically sold my soul to the devil to play this game as much as I have and I have no regrets doing so.The mods complete this game there are so many and so many good ones the community is awesome too.10/10 would sacrafice a feminist vegan to see this game in first person/3D/VR.
1;When i saw it i thought ewww this game doesn't look good but oh i was wrong. Im addicted to this game. I Now can't stop playing &amp thinking of what to do in this game. Mods make the game even more better and exicting to play very pleased! 15 Well Spent.
1;Factorio has been one of my favorite games of all time since I bought it and it only cost me a couple hundred hours and most of my soul. Beware while playing as time does not work the way its supposed to while this game is running. I typically play for about an hour and then quit only to discover it's actually been almost two days and I'm really friggin hungry.100/10 would addict again
1;Finally a game that works perfectly on a Mac when advertised. I love this game. My brother and I have been playing this for awhile and we've been making a huge factory on our LAN server. This game is great to play with friends and fun to experiment withI've died 3 times all from my own trains. 10/10 would die again
1;This is probably my favorite game. And I mean it's up there with Halo 3 and Portal. If you don't want to buy this game because it's early access trust me it's better than many full releases. Besides what are you gonna buy besides this game? Tuition or a house or food? This'll do.
1;I admire the developers for creating a work of art. I love playing this game and am proud to be part of its community. I can imagine where the developers and the community will take this but I definately can't wait to see it. Please become part of the journey and if you are already bring your frineds along as well.10/10 For those two of you who understand binary but also for the other 8.
1;I kinda wish this game was built by a machine and that the end goal was to build a machine that would build Factorio so that I would be teaching a machine to build itself while designing machines that could build themselves so that the machine could build itself by making machines that can build themselves.8/8 would make game play itself again
1;MP don't even try without broadband connection also don't a lag compensation which causes more lag than it tires to hideotherwise an open sandbox. if you don't mind buildung spending your first 2 hours in the game exactly the same way in every map you start.there is a serious lag of end game goals but you can spend so many hours in optimizing your production chain that you get your bang for your buck as long as you like optimizing production chains.

1;Factorio is a game that once you get into it youll never want to stop playing. youll spend hours on a creation just to tear it down because you thoght of a way to make it more efficient. the main perpose of the game is to do work makeing something that will do work for you. I dont have much more to say than to just get it you wont be disapointed.
1;What do I think of Factorio?Let me tell you what I think of Factorio...right after I adust this belt. Oh no I am running low on iron ore. Dang it how come my power is so low? Where are my lasers? Oh great my plastic isn't being manufactured. What is going on with my oil production?(4 hours later)...what was the question again?
1;A fantastic game with endless potential due to the modded community gives a certain replayability. The playtime for the main game is insane over 24 hours to launch the rocket and then you can conitnue to create crazier and crazier factories. A wonderfully satisfying experience if you enjoy creating everything from nothing this is the game for you.
1;"""Even at 400+ hours I have only """"beat"""" the game once (by launching a rocket into space). Most of that time has been spent in the vanilla game and yet I still feel like I have so much left to learn.Every time I start a new playthrough I learn some new techniques discover something new or come up with a new challenge to try.There is just so much to this amazing game.BUY NOW!"""
1;Playing Factorio is kind of like studying with your friends for an upcoming exam.You quickly realise how many of you should probably be on a disability spectrum and that one other dude is so next level he's probably the reincarnate of Socrates or something. Factorio is the Rick and Morty of video games.
1;Sooo... Factorio....Think of this game as... if Minecrafts Tekkit or Feed the Beast or Tech Mod Packs had a baby with OpenTTD.Now put that baby on Steroids. You'll probably get something like Factorio.Just don't be alarmed if you don't realize your alarm went off...If that doesn't tell you enough i don't know what would to be honest.
1;I love this game I bought it at the Factorio website before it was even on Steam and it was amazing even then. You start with a drill a furnace and a little bit of iron. You turn those things into a base wich can be attacked by aliens. You have to survive all the while working on refining your automatic crafting your furnaces your turrets and most importantly working towards a missile silo to launch a satellite into space. Lots of fun and multiplayable.
1;"""Played this for several dozen hours presteam just through less legal means. Using the excuse """"Oh I'll just buy it once it comes to steam"""". So once I saw it was released on steam (and climbing the most popular tab) I decided to keep my promise. I'm glad I can finally show my support."""
1;You wanna know why people some people cant give this a review?Cause its just going to waste their time on not building their factoriesThis has game has taught me alot about handling situations that seem too overwhelming. just gotta take it slow. breathe in. and then cry when someone else (aliens) comes over and gives you more tasks to worry about.
1;The game is fun and refreshing (comp mode that is I don't care for casual) but it needs A LOT of work. NWI has been putting out frequent and promising updates but I'm still far from satisfied. Far from e sports ready but still has a whackload of potential. Give this game a shot and if you're more patient than I am then you'll definitely be pleased.
1;a really good game if you dislike it off the bat then be persistent and you will most likely begin enjoying it. if you have no luck playing pvp like me play against bots or play coop for some time this will help you get used to the unique playstyle of the game. i digress THE GAME IS FARKING GOOD.
1;Best game ever!!! The Devs actually listen to the comminity unlike AAA titles. NWI has made some great games with Sandstorm actually being a good sequal to the orignal insurgency. They did a really good keeping the feel of the original insurgency running on source engine and keeping that same feel on the new Unreal 4 engine. Game runs great looks gret and the competitive scene is very friendly. I would highly reccomend this game!
1;Fantastic game if you've got a newer to newish cpu runs way better than it does than the stuttery mess on console. Be warned this game is very cpu intensive so if you've just been skimming by with a quadcore from 6 years ago you're going to have some issues.
1;Won't have much to say beyond what most detailed reviews have already said. But it is worth mentioning that while the connectivity issues can be frustrating the rest of the game is incredibly fun if you have even a tiny interest in playing Monster Hunter World please give it a shot.
1;Playing on my laptop i7 6700HQ 8GB RAM NVidia 950M GTX installed on SSD. Works absolutely fine loads very fast graphics is at low but fps is at stable 60. I understand people are having issues with Denuvo and hopefully they will be fixed for them fast. I had no issues so far.As for the gameplay I have already put a lot of hours on PS4 planning to put just as much on PC. The game is very fun both in solo and co op and offers different playstyles with all the different weapons.
1;The game is good now connection issues are non existing so ignore those reviews. This game has plenty improvements over the other entries nature has traps monsters don't (always) team up against you and the specialized tools are great. The new monsters are super fun to fight music is amazing and the overal atmosphere is great!9/10. Needs more layered armor.
1;Having problems getting it to have controller support? Try this Click Steam in the top corner of your Steam App Click Settings Controller General Controller Settings Enable Xbox Playstation or Switch ControllerThis solved the controller problem for me! )
1;Two of my friends and I spent 200 hours looking for our friend Don. We inquired with every monster in the New World for Don's location. Some were more stubborn than others lethal even.The pieces came together. We found Don. Hardest hunt ever.Where's Don/10.
1;Do I recommend it? Yes. Is it perfect? Far from it. But it still scratched my third person slash em up RPG itch.Biggest positives Presentation combat movement mechanics map design are all fantasticBiggest negatives Poor optimization / performance spotty matchmaking and barely functional multiplayer servers (probably launch issues but nonetheless) some fights get very tedious
1;It's a pretty great jump into modern systems. While it does have less content than the most recent old gen game this is understandable since they're building resources back up from the ground. I spent at least an hour in the training grounds just playing with all of the new weapon mechanics. They managed to add something new to each one and there is a tremendous amount of quality of life improvement across the board.
1;To anyone reading this who likes what they have seen but is on the fence about getting the game due to the mixed reviews the few MINOR issues this game does have are so inconsequential compared to everything this game gets right its truly puzzling to me that someone could be so off put that it could cause them to not play what is truly a great video game experience.
1;Wtf how is it even possible that I've not been playing right from the start?To be fair this is my first MH and I was pretty overwhelmed at the beginning. But between the early confusion and now one thing hasnt changed the game has such a powerful suction force. Great 9/10
1;Dont get discouraged by the mixed ratings. most of the errors disconnections and bugs on release was patched recently. there's still few minor fixes left but the game is still progressing as long as there is patches the game will get better and better. 10/10 excited for future updates and releases &lt 3
1;Network issues and missing content aside this game is phenominal. I adore it and just want more content and monsters and G rank to fill the voids in my heart that MH4U so easily filled.Also there's an Ultrawide mod now that works flawlessly even if the HUD is a bit offset )
1;i loved it on the PSP and i love it even more on PC+cool armor/weapons+loot drops from monsters you kill+awesome storyline with epic cutscenes+interesting monster mechanics+tight controls and variance with weapons+great QoL improvements to make the game friendlier to new people+nice updates bringing it up to par with console performance is so so multiplayer is buggy at times
1;Amazing game. Gameplay is great although I hate The Handler side character extremely annoying. Also the multiplayer net connection bug is still a major issue. Althought this will hopefully get patched soon so don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews
1;The multiplayer connection issues were pretty annoying in the first week but I've noticed they've been a little better the past few days. All in all I've had a blast with this game so far. Looking forward to the content that's been released on console to make its way to the PC version.
1;Short and simple this is my first Monster Hunter game and I am having a blast. Yeah it has a few performance and connection problems but it's amazingly addicting and that fun experience outshadows the minor inconveniences! I don't seem to have performance issues like lots of other people plus my friends and I are all able to play together without disconnecting so it's a thumbs up from me!
1;Highly recommendedDont look at the old reviews as there were server issue when it first came out on steam. They have made progress fixing and the server are way better now while they are currently still looking into the issue and fixing it.Awesome combat systemMultiple weaponaryGood endgame contentMultiple events weeklyMonster slayingHave quite a learning curveStill awaiting upcoming update contents
1;Pretty good. Tons of stuff to do. Going co op or multiplayer isn't a must until you reach Behemoth. Even then some players are able to take him down solo. If you do wanna go co op or multiplayer just join a server with a lot of people or fire that SOS flare. People are quite friendly and are more than willing to help ( here in Asia anyway)
1;This is my 2nd time buying it and even with the current state of affairs (8/17/18) I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's got tight combat a satisfying grind and could be the gateway drug you need into the franchise. The current issues with the port are being addressed by Capcom so I hope the influx of rage reviews isn't hurting the game.10/10 80 hours in the first week in.
1;"""Best Monster Hunter game series! I love the new features on game. Updates Event Quest new Monsters and more Take note This game is still unstable don't buy this game if youre having a """"P O T A T O"""" PC specs..upgrade your hardwares before you buy this game for better Hunting Experience!"""
1;So far I enjoyed playing this game. It's challenging fun and really worth my time. I love the graphics the gameplay system and character personalization as well. Although there are still many problems that need to be fixed especially the connection for co op multiplayers you can enjoy this game as solo player. I hope that the connection problem will soon be fixed as I want to play this game with my friends without being disconnected every 10 minutes or so.
1;Put some time it what does it do well? Performs well for me Only conectivity issues occured when alt tab'ing Well rounded game experience Enough value at price pointWhat does it not do well K/B mouse controls Lack of true binding system many pc players are used too Clunky keyboard radial menu When I want the game closed...close the f'n game don't care where I am Did I say K/B mouse?Overall I enjoyed the game but easy to see why some may not be able to overlook the poor port issues
1;My very first MH game have to say that so far it's a favorite! Currently I have had zero performance issues with this title. My current setup i5 3.4gGTX980ti16GB DDR3Win 10 64bitI can't recommend this game enough if you're just looking for fun. The multiplayer is a little clunky with the menu setup but its operable and functions fine. Almost 90 hours played in my first week and I hope to keep at this game for some time to come.8/10
1;Product received for free. In the reviews i saw here are stupid this is a very good game just hard. If you play it by your self and defeat all monsters then you'r a god but otherwise you always need a team luckuly there for is SOS. Yes the game has glitches but they can always be fixed un like Assassin's creed... In this game you find out what grinding really is and if you dont like it then get a friend and do it with him so it be more exiting! Final verdict buy the god damm game!!!
1;I was expecting review to be like Overwhelming positive.......But still a Good game!!I have played on PS4 and end it up getting on a PC as well!! )It's really fun and amazing game! Mostly I'm playing as solo. I hope they fix the online part though.Happy Hunting!!
1;7/10would be 10/10 capcom needs to fix the settings and controls for pc imo. I get random frame drops and crashes and online dc. No ultra wide support as well. Capcom needs to fix these problems and the game would be a top notch title for any game library.
1;Good game great gameplay works as intended despite a few minimal flaws. I can play with my friends most of the time. Went into this series since the PS2 era and I'm happy this gets ported to PC. Most recent patch made multiplayer better I haven't DC once since then.Like Monster Hunter in general? Don't miss this out!
1;This game is everything I ever wanted. Im a pretty casual gamer but I can't get enough. Trust me that does not mean it is not diffcult. Maybe not like Freedom Unite difficult...but I fail an average of 5 times per hunt and I still return. it's that yummy. As an animator and modeler I am constantly impressed by the work that went into this. Japanese games are typically no short of sexy.
1;Long story short. Low lvl players get lookt down on.High lvl players look like god. ____________________________________________________________________Make sure you get some friends who play it so that you wont need to solo it!The game is really slow if your alone. trust me im lvl 80 and i only have 2 3 friends i play with. The game is hard but really fun with friends. so i strogly recommend you to get it IF you have friends____________________________________________________________________

1;My childhood game much anticipated for the online version since 8 years and now it is finally here. Thanks Capcom you are awesome.Game runs smoothly and everything is working without an issue using xbox one controller and detected immediately. Don't know what these negative reviews are all about but if you like this type of game go for it. Game of the year.
1;A number of QoL improvements over previous titles make this game easily accessible to newcomers but a large amount of depth and semi hidden mechanics make sure that it's not too simple for the advanced player. A grinding system that has properly satisfying rewards does wonders to keep one playing and a huge variety of playstyles in the 14 weapon classes ensures you're likely to find something suiting for you. If you've never played Monster Hunter it's for sure a good time to start.
1;Its Monster Hunter. Its on PC. What more do you s want?Really though any of the (minor) problems that occoured during the launch are all fixed up now and everything seems to run smoothley for me. Its a great game with hours of content and is constantly getting updates.
1;This game is honestly fantastic... Yeah it is having it's network issues but no point in freaking out I'm sure they're working on it. And anyone complaining about this hogging up their entire CPU are probably trying to run it on the highest setting. Turn everything down and it's fine. I'm hitting max 65% CPU usage on an I5 8600k and running 60 FPS easy...
1;Great game to play with friends. Specifically now after they have fixed the online issues. I don't get disconnected anymore at all. I'm happy with my purchase and looking forward for future content. I'd gladly buy expansions for this game if we ever get any since I already played the game more than a 100 hours without getting bored.By the way this is the first monster hunter game that I have ever played.
1;I understand and respect people's issues with the connectivity problems but anecdotally speaking it seems the issues are being ironed out. I haven't dropped my connection to a party in the last week or so.The game is fantastic and will only get better.
1;I mostly play solo due to me being lonely and bad at soicalising so ive never encountered the 50382 MW1 error code however the rest of the game is amazing to me ive only played one over entry to this series which was MH3U and i found it amazing so i was happy to get a MH coming to pc. i thibk this game is amazing however i do find a few frame drops and the lack of optomization disapionting but those are the only issues i have amazing game if you have the pc for it.
1;I recommend this game mainly because i have played every release that was in the united states buying multiple different consoles specifically for this game and with it now being on pc it takes a large burden off me. Also to be frank how can a game where you hunt giant dinomonsters with giant weapons not be simply badass?
1;you basically kill things to get stuff so you can kill things to get stuff... faster.the reviews on the pc version are mixed probably due to the connectivity issues during the first few weeks of release. as a ps4 immigrant i would encourage first time players to stay on for the upcoming content it will be worth it.
1;A great grind that focuses heavily on combat and environment.Not much of a story but that's not the focus of this game.Track big monster kill big monster skin big monster make bad weapons and armor repeat.If you like variety there are plenty of different weapons each with a unique playstyleDefinitely good dollar/per hour valueI mean I liked it enough to buy it twice if that says anything.If only we would get the street fighter events...
1;Wow I'm really not sure why the game is being reviewed so badly on steam.There are a few glaring issues (TAA makes the game as blurry as a unfocused camera for **some** people (first switch to fxaa or turn off antialiasing) multiplayer connections can be a bit spotty) but the game itself is fine.Realize before you buy Monster Hunter combat is and always has been very methodical. If you attack chances are you will watch the full attack animation before you do anything else.
1;'People can't find settings menu and rather complain instead' simulator 2018Yet the game is awesome + runs smooth on 1070/4790k almost all maxed up &lt 3Although you can't really play online because 'A communication error occurred'Also pls can I remove bloom or make it lower at least? _ Yaaay!...
1;A great beginner friendly entry into the Monster Hunter franchise. Great sense of progression in that you actually feel like you are a better player rather than just a noob with better weapons. Will keep you busy for hours has occasional updates with new monsters/events and reduces several of the obtuse gathering headaches of previous MH games.For fans of the older games it may be worth a look at the negative reviews to see if the game's changes are your cup of tea.
1;Monster Hunter World is a bit easy game compare to console game line such as MHGENX and its previous versions.There's only 2 outcome while playing this game. Either you get bored or get addicted and spend 10+ hours a day.Only down side on this game is disconnection when connecting to other Online sessions. Other than that it's worth the time!
1;my first MH game ever and i am very satisfied with the gameplaypro's story darksoul like (less crazy) too many to make amazingly fun with co op fluid movement Con's server still ed up (hope they'll fix it soon) frame drop when there's a multiple eletric element weapon
1;As a newcomer to the series I have nothing but praise. A very good game. Easy to grasp hard to master. It's just the right mix of Diablo/Borderlands (the loot mechanics) and a Hack 'n Slash. The port itself is OK. It's a basic Japanese to PC port. So some things are a bit off but there's nothing alarming. It runs and functions above average.
1;everyone that has a negative review on this game have lost their minds. the game is great. yes there are connectivitiy issues but what do you expect from a company that has rarely put out pc games. they're at least trying. other than that the game is fun to play. i highly recommend the game do not listen to the negative reviews. give it some time for capcom to work out the kinnks and it will be even better. it's the first week.
1;well its a fun game.. played the 1st one.. and thought its gone forever .. now it show up again D ....best game ever XDStill fun as ever beLearn movement set Farm for stuff to make u more powerfull..and some funny moment with the Random Player..Patience is the key don't Rush 3
1;It's Monster Hunter. Either you like the series or you don't.If you're new to Monster Hunter you'll need to look into some in depth gameplay videos lest you end up like many others complaining about legitamate features/mechanics as if they were issues.
1;Only problem is work/kids/life get in the way!Awesome controls epic fights and amazing graphicsEdit 48 hour mark. Issues still stand wish I could find more hours in the day. Tells you something when you wish certain monsters would leave your buddy (barroth) alone. He just wants to roll around in the mud and be free.First timer to Monster Hunter and likely now a lifer.
1;This game isn't something where you go and slaughter everything you see. If you honestly think that's what the game's about you are in for a surprise.2 3 hours in is tutorial w/ forced cutscene to get you immersive with Monsta Hunta. I'm running with ai7 77kGTX 1060Also for the love of god don't call this a dark souls clone you uncultured swine. This series been around since the Playstation Classic. Edit Hey Capcom remove Denuvo DRM from MH World
1;THX CAPCOM my time in life lost for your game Thank for give me a new experience from gamei don't care graphic or space PC I play for Adventure &amp for FUN 100/10 FROM ME NOICE GAMEAre YOU READY Become to HUNTER !?Let's get it SOLO STYLE Wait for next event
1;Most of the negative reviews are regarding the bad port. Well the port is indeed bad but if you have a decent specs you shouldn't have problems and it's written the minimum specs. So it's a useless hate... the game is wonderful and runs perfectly fine.
1;I don't understand the 55% postive reviews this game is golden its well optimized controls great sounds great looks gorgeous and has hundreds to thousands of hours of content I don't see this many negative reviews for dark souls cause of the M&amp K controls so what gives? its a yes for me capcom!PS It's still good
1;I have to say that monster hunter language translation is sloppy at best. Fluent monster hunterese speakers such as myself actively struggle at times to make out what the characters in this game are saying despite the setting. Pronunciation is all over the place and grammar wasn't even an afterthought. I seriously hope that capcom can fix this in the future so me and other Monster Hunters can enjoy the game in a way meaningful to us.
1;A pure masterpiece.Have over 450 hours on Monster Hunter TRI for the WII. Planning to squeeze out of this baby at least twice as much.Thank you for this great great game Capcom. Easily one of my most favorite games of all times.Never in my life i enjoyed a grindfest as much i enjoy it with this game.Buy it. You won't regret it.
1;Another monster hunter. Another ten out of ten. This one is definitley the newest and most innovative improving on everything from previous titles. Some people seemed to have given the game bad reviews because it didn't run well. I had no such problems.The game is amazing. Worth seventy bucks for preorder deluxe version. This may be my faovrite monster hunter yet. 10/10.
1;The most accessible Monster Hunter game to date allowing beginners a chance to jump into this awesome franchise. If you play this and like it but wish there was more either get a 3DS or a Switch and play some other games in the series. They are harder have more content and the knowledge obtained from here can mostly be taken into other games to makes getting into them easier.
1;yeah ive been waiting many years for this to become a reality and im just happy its here fun fact MHW on started devlopment on pc when the game was released on console and it was their first pc release in their devlopment history if your curious about more MHW fact head over to did you know gaming to find out moreEDIT server issues are fixed 9.5/10
1;My friend and I have only gotten into the Monster Hunter series in the last few years but my god is it a phenomenal franchise. I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to go from a DS to a PC Monster Hunter game. I appreciate people have had issues with the game but my friend and I haven't had any. The gameplay graphics and just overall enjoyment of this game for us is top notch. I couldn't reccommend the game enough.
1;37.7 hours and not a single disconnect on my end most the people complaining about disconnects are probably at college or on wifi. Don't let those deter you from this wonderful game if you have good enough internet or hell single player experience is great too.
1;I have played over 100 hours on my sister's ps4. I bought the pc release without hesitation for the content of the game. As foe today the dev didnt update the game yet and the netcode are terrible. Disconnecting etc ... plzz dev show the pc port some love..
1;Great game! Very much enjoying it even after I've hit endgame for a while now. I never really had issues since the beginning neither with the optimization (i7 4790 with GTX 780 playing at 40 60 fps) or with the servers. There is the occasional net issue but it's usually resolved by me resetting my net.
1;People are complaining about thing that we knew for a long time won't be in the game. Game is great and works perfectly if you meet the minimal requirements. We don't have any confirmation about denuvo doing anything but people still complain yes it's far from perfect but stop being sheep and have your own opinion.Still great.
1;The new Nvidia drivers still cause the game to run only on cpu I'm using a i5 4460 intel cpu and a gtx 1050 ti. The older driver 2 patches before the new RTX nvidia driver works fine but I would obviously love to use the new nvidia drivers with the game working instead of keeping the old drivers
1;i5 6600k Overclocked to 4.0Nvidia 970 Stock16gb RAM60 FPS on Medium High Settings with some frame drops during intense fights with tons of particle effects which is expected400+ hours later between PS4 and PC (Yes I double dipped) and this game is still addicting as ever. Sure it had its hiccups at launch with connection issues but that has been fixed for most with the latest update. Gorgeous game with amazing gameplay and 100s of hours to immerse yourself into the New World.
1;Played it on xbox it is a great game and it runs smoothly on my computer. I'm going to enjoy it to the max! I understand that people have complaints about this game but it's quite good. I haven't had one big issue. Only one little issue and that is when I lose connectivity to others online but other than that the game runs smoothly and has continued to keep me entertained )
1;after playing it for a while here is my review its a pretty fun game if you got friends to play with graphicly its oke here and there some weird bugs but overall pretty good gameplay wise at first the game can be pretty disoriantating with with its controlls fast and intens... pretty good addition to your collection but wait for a sale
1;Capcom did a good job imo fixing bugs that were introduced with the beginning of the game. They communicated multiple times they were working on things (connectivity) and even put out smaller patches that helped reduce the issue before they were able to completely fix it.
1;One of the most fun game I have played! The story is not that interesting but the gameplay is what is excellent in this game. Some people have fps issues and other issues that Capcom trys to fix and releases updates quickly when it comes big issues that effects almost everyone. It is a full game when it was released but there is updates that add new monsters and other additions that the game doesn't need but is a very nice addition.
1;Game is awesome runs way better than console. Load times are quick. Multiplayer has been fixed. They threw out content fast. Highly recommend playing. Great addition to the seriez been plaging since freedom unite and I really dont have any complaints besides them taking out oils for sns lol
1;Yes there are some connectivity issues. Yes the port has some optimization issues. It's still worth full price. This game is a masterpiece. Once you've gotten used to the flow of combat and familiarized yourself with the progression loop it's incredibly fun. This game is somewhat of an acquired taste but once you've acquired it nothing else will do. Fixes are on the way but the port's sufficient for now.
1;Well this is my FIRST monster hunter game...Kudos to the amaizng graphic There are so much to explore craft and things to do .This game is amazing dont let the negative reviews stop you from buying this game . Solo feels way better then mutiplayer .The server might have some disconnect issue.Those people whom gave the game a bad review are filthy casual. If there are network error then play solo .This game is similar to dark souls so try to git gud or GET TF OUT .10/10
1;Great game. Epic fight. Solid game play system. recommended.However online session lag of player interaction. Gathering hub is so empty. 200hrs in game but no interaction from multiplayer session. Just slaying monster and disband. It would be better if online session is more lively.
1;Super fun game so far. Many people complaining about kb+m controls but I used them for about 4 hours at the beginning before I switched over to controller and they werent unplayable or anything. Would reccommend having a controller though its a little smoother and easier overall it feels. Game looks really nice too + theres lots of content.
1;i5 6500GTX 970I don't have a crazy PC but after almost 10 hours Stable at 50 60 FPS with medium graphics which are still BEAUTIFUL Not a single crash/bug Controller supported without any issue (I'm even using my Switch Pro Controller) Amazing game. The MH every fan wanted.
1;trying to dowload this game was a series of misfortunate events such as reaching the quota limit for my internet mid download and having to go to my relatives to continue the download and even sleeping over at their place just to game but I can say it was totally worth . this game is incredible and just soo fun I can't stop
1;The latest and greatest addition to the Monster Hunter series. I have been playing these games since 2009 and I can say without a doubt that Monster Hunter is one of my favorite games of all time and this installment is no exception. I also managed to get my skeptical friends to play and they absolutely love it. Whether this is your first Monster Hunter or your a long time veteran there is something for everyone to love about this game.
1;Few crashes since updating drivers and turning graphics settings from Highest down to High and setting frame cap to no limit! (Restarting seemed to fix the crash on launch issue)Definitely the best Monster Hunter experience to date! Can't talk need to play more Monster Hunter!
1;I am immensely enjoying this so far. The only problem I have is the Radial menu and the occasional DC from multiplayer sessions. I have not experienced any issues besides the DCing which is not as bad as it seems. It gets annoying when doing long sessions but its not every match.I would recommend this as this issue will hopefully be resolved eventually.
1;Game looks good and runs fine. Been playing with friends online its pretty fun.I wish it was harder like it was on PSP. I feel like its a little to easy. Could be because i've played the other games and understand what to do. Hopefully a mod or a hard mode will come out. That would be my only complaint.
1;i played this francise back when psp was a thing and i enjoy it so much. and then i got this news about the game goin to pc. so hell yeaa i'll buy it even though it's a rough start with connection and multiplayer issues but now it's enjoyable. if you want solo hunt go... go then need help just fire sos. this game is the most newcomer friendly imho so it's a good start if you want to jump right into the franchise.MORE MONSTERS PLZ!!Happy Hunting!!
1;Love this game so far! Been playing the monster hunter series for a long time and I'm loving being able to play on PC! Little rough around the edges on the first week but I'm happy with the game so far. Would 100% recomend to anyone that likes boss battle type games!
1;The games amazing really fun to play with friends and solo. There's the occasional disconnect from friend sessions but can be easily rejoined. Alot of negative reviews for small things that you would expect from a game thats been out for 3 days. Alot of this stuff will be ironed out eventually just give it time. The gameplay is outstanding with alot of fun elements and doesn't feel to grindy if you want to get a specific item set or weapon.420/10 IGN
1;From playing a lot of the other games in my past and playing this one I can say that the new combos and interesting mechanics are what make this game different. I completely enjoy everthing about it including the graphics. Highly recommend this game for anyone looking to play an rpg with friends or solo.
1;Product received for free. Best port game of 2018?What to say...........Feels Great Runs Great Looks Great has events can be easy but can be hard variety on weapons and team combinations play with randoms or friends etc.One thing i really enjoyed was the fact that we play(hunt) with teams of 4 but you can create a lobby up with 16 friends from there joining and playing different monsters and team combinations and be able to help a lot of players.
1;Its a game about grinding for getting mats for upgrade ur gear but the fact is that grinding in this game is really a great thing. It has some connection issues that can be frustrating but it s definitely a solid game for having casual game times. It has lot of action the history is good and it has a lot of weapons with diferent combos. It is somehow similar to Dark Souls in the way you fight with the creatures but its not as dark as DS.
1;Tons of exploration. Really enjoying the game in spite of early headaches getting the settings just right. Outside of the monster hunts the game can be quite chill I really like running around the map and seeing what I can do. Oh and fishing minigame is life.
1;Yes there are kludgy bits that stem from this being a console port.But you should still buy it.Monster Hunter is the greatest boss fighting video game franchise of all time and while the learning curve can be steep the payoff and feedback from killing monsters and turning their parts into specialized gear for killing other monsters is an incredibly addicting loop and I've been enthralled since MH Tri hit NA on the Wii.
1;Game is great and runs great on high resolution textures even on my 6 year old Sapphire Radeon HD 7970.If you're experiencing high fps drops I recommend putting your GPU in the oven like I did. 195 degrees centigrade for 9 minutes. I oven baked it after it stopped working and now it performs better than it originally did.
1;I was on the fence about getting this game. But my buddy convinced and I had a blast the main story was great even though I was trying to blast through it quickly so I could start hunting with my friend. (He could help me with main story quests after I had watched the cinematics which is kind of annoying.) None the less it is a blast to play and hopfully we get alot more monsters to hunt soon haha!
1;"""Played since 4U and have experienced connection issues since then. IMO Capcom has improved MH's connectivity issues but it still needs to have a major update for connections and 'solo"""" play lobby. Overall the gameplay is great. Lots of new things such as a much more nature filled terrain new armor system SOS calls etc. Still feels like a Monster Hunter game and doesn't give you the feeling that you're playing a game from another series."""
1;Want to leave a review but dont want to stop playing.Killing monsters while looking like an action hero is awesome.Video settings require some tweaking to get a smooth experience.Inventory is great with a controller but terrible with a mouse. Use a controller.
1;It's an amazing game as Monster Hunter always is but I can't play multiplayer at all. Communication error occured error code 83 MW1 every 10 minutes and Failed to connect to session members error code 50382 MW1 when I try to join a friend or matchmaking. Giving a recommend in hopes that server issues fix.
1;"""It's a really fun game glad they ported it to the PC cause I don't buy consoles. The port could have been better but giving a game thumbs down with the phrase """"amazing game"""" in the description is a contradictionin my book. Me and my buddy have been playing pretty regularly for a while now with only occasional connection issues but it occurs so infrequently that we barely notice and the quality of the game certainly makes up for it."""
1;I have a pretty decent computer that can run on highest settings with a flat 60fps. I don't know why people complain so much about optimizataion not every game can run on a toaster after all. The servers are a bit of an issue but you cant expect god teir servers on launch. Specs Processor Intel core i7 7700k RAM 16gbGraphics Nivida 1070
1;The game is amazing! It is essentially Boss battle the game. Beat on super cool monsters with ridiculously large weapons and make sweet looking sets of armour! My only problem with it is the online play you can't just PLAY through the story with your friends which really drives a wedge into the fun you are having. But there are ways around it so it isn't the worst.
1;All I'm reading is people need to get good.The network issues and unskippable cutscenes / cutscenes being mandatory to hunt together are completely valid criticisms.But the gameplay ones are just hilarious. Get good. You play this game on its terms not Dark Soul's terms not God of War's terms it's own terms.Learn the monsters and learn your weapon and you will be rewarded with a deep and almost infinite gameplay loop.
1;If you like delibrate methodical combat i cant recommend MHW enought. Its quite confusing and a bit frustrating for new players but for those who put in the effort its greatly satisfying. It needs some tweaks performace wise but nothing game breaking. If you've played MH before these no reason not to buy MHW I highly recommed his game.
1;Everything works fine for me despite all the negative reviews (I know it's not an argument but still). Game plays at 45 60 fps 1440p. My config 1070GTX i5 4670K 16 Gb DDR3. The only sad thing is that the game doesn't support* 21 9 (the game has the resolution options such as 3440 1440 and similar but you'll have black bars on the sides of the screen). Hopefully we'll get a fix for that soon either from modders or officially.
1;Take most of the negative reviews as written by negative people yes some are valid as not major changes have been made and the controls do take awhile to get used to on KBM and DOF does need to be added as an option to be turned off. However the game does deliver what it delivered earlier this year and improve its visuals and gameplay.
1;Can you change Manage Investigation UI maybe adding some sorts delete selected quest etc when you spent half of the time on investigating it really sucks that you have to scroll all through to really get what you want. others game is great really brings back some memories and maybe fix connections issue
1;Bought a PlayStation 2 fourteen years ago to play MH with my friends. Playing MHW with them now and it's the same great experience if not better because others whom have been waiting for a decade for a PC release in English now can join in on the fun.
1;This game will be going in my favorite games list. It has great gameplay good controls (I play with mouse and keyboard and have no problems) it has a good difficulty (not to hard and not to easy but you should learn the movesets of the monsters) and also the graphics are not that bad. I dont have any crashes or one of the other problems but I hope that they will fix the problems for some of the players so that everyone can enjoy this game.
1;A great game with a lot of problems in it. The problems usually aren't about the gameplay but the errors. I guess months of porting didn't mean too much huh? I love the game and I hate it at the same time. I'm enjoying it quite a bit tho so I'll give it a thumbs up. Hope the errors get fixed soon.
1;This game is just amazing the graphics the new mechanics and weapon combos. A newbie and a veteran can pick up this game and can easily learn how the game works. the story is okay but the main thing here is hunting monsters and how you use your environment againts it. im almost at my 300 hrs mark and it still feels fresh to me. Overall i recommend this game to both new to the monster hunter franchise and the veterans. hoping for more free/paid dlc updates!
1;It's one of the best games i've played this year and it completely catched my attention. They also fixed a lot of conection issues and the multiplayer is so well designed i love it even being a lone wolf! The comments about the content not coming to PC are (for the moment) all true and i understand their anger however this game is just too good to not recommend it
1;Pros The game is awesome! Fun to play interesting gameplay lots of customization etc.Cons Unskippable cutscenes! Why?Spending 2 5 minutes between missions to watch characters chat can be annoying but doesn't ruin the game for me. Makes subsequent characters annoying to catch up though.
1;Totally addicting game fresh idea learning curve is above normal and the game is fun. Each weapon plays like a different a game and its 14 type i doubt you will get bored just learning all the playstyle not to mention build alter playstyle of the same weapon too which add more fun Almost the negative review are already patch up very long ago. Some peps dont change there reviews anymore. You are missing alot for not playing this game so i recommend purchasing this game
1;"""""""I'm just thinking to myself right now we should just cancel the election and give it to MHW right?""""""""I thought killing monsters would be easier than my old life.""""""""Why can't we use nuclear weapons?""""""""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her whatever""""""""I know more about monster hunting than the generals do. Believe me.""""""""I have tremendous respect for monster hunting women.""""10/10 The Don"""
1;This is a very smooth game well worth the time. While optimization does seem to be very rough I am able to run it in medium settings smoothly with a mediocre pc. It never lost the charm of the previous titles that drew in such a cult following while it's new features made the experience feel new but the core aspect is still intact. 10/10 recommend.
1;Great game a standard that should be set by all game studios. Free content being the main thing.Had little to no server issues so you shouldn't worry. Also googled for an fps fix which rolled back my nvidia drivers. I went from 13fps in rotten vale to 50+. I suggest this if you're having problems.
1;Overall it isn't a bad game the story is enjoyable despite skipping over most of it to catch up with my friend. Prior to Winterfest's release a lot of players have been crashing mid dungeon and haven't really been given much insight on what to do. Some days I couldn't clear a single dungeon because of these connection issues and other days I never experienced any issues. For the most part though I never experienced any issues with the game outside of the fact that I was not very good.
1;I've never played Monster Hunter until now and WOAH BOY is this an amazing start. As you can see I am insane and have spent every waking moment playing this thing learning every weapon type building a huge armory finding EVERY LAST DAMN PET.Get this game you will not regret it.
1;Product received for free. If you've ever considered getting into the Monster Hunter franchise I highly recommend picking up this game. It's much more friendly to new players than recent installments the game is beautiful the creature design is fantastic and the combat feels absolutely great. No other game has fufilled my fantasy of jumping off a cliff with a rocket powered greatsword into the spine of a monster quite like this one has 9/10.
1;It's fantastic. If you can be patient and wait for Capcom to iron out their network issues and you play with a controller I can easily recommend this game. After playing on Xbox and Playstation the PC version is definitely the best version. My biggest complaint is the PC community's skill level. Y'all need to look up some videos or read some forums and git gud.Feed me with your hate filled comments. I love you all.
1;My first monster hunter experience at first I hated this game. The port turned my 1080ti into a nuclear reactor the camera was awful and i couldn't find a weapon I was good at.Giving it a fair shot I disabled some seemingly useless graphics options and my temperatures returned to normal I looked up a guide on how to git gud with my edgy katana.Now I think the game is brilliant except nergie screw that dragon.11/10 would melt my pc again.
1;Don't listen to the overall review score. This is without a doubt the best Monster Hunter ever take it from someone who has played every mh since 3. I've put in over thirty hours with as much multiplayer as I want and only had one disconnect during a mission. Connectivity is great and the environments and new monsters make this game a near perfect experience.
1;This game marks the biggest leap forward that Monster Hunter ever did. During the first half of the game the gameplay will be easy to pick up for newcomer while the second half is challenging it does everything right to bring new players and veteran together.
1;Steam reviews are worthless. Literally most of my favourite games have mixed reviews on steam. Top rated games are usually dumb indies with no depth at all and boring and basic mechanics.(see cuphead). PC community is either really casual or too poor to afford a decent pc. Probably both hehe. 0 connection and perfomance issues here my new rule is to plain ignore steam reviews when getting a game.
1;"""It's ok I guess.Monster Hunter World releases on console January 26th. Lunastra is then updated into the game May 31st. (About four months)Monster Hunter World releases on pc August 9th. Lunastra is updated into the game November 22nd. (About four months)""""ACceLeRatED CONtEnT ReLeAsE ScHeDuLe"""""""
1;all the haters.Is the game perfect? No.Is the game great? Yes.I am very critical when it comes to games. I haven't preordered a game in 10 years but I did this time. I am grateful Capcom finally gives us a Monster Hunter for PC. Hopefully updates will come to improve the experience.
1;Brilliantly optimised. I will see how the game progresses and edit this review accordingly. Been an MH fan for a long while and this game looks to meet expectations.They ve also almost completely fixed the bugs that plagued online multiplayer which is good.
1;A fat mountain broke a cruise ship that I was riding on I stopped the chubby volcano from destroying a wall then after several quests I killed a fat mountain and it nuked atlantis then we killed a negrigante and then a zombie dragon got mad 'oh you killed my friend so now I'll kill people' then I killed a baby lizard who kept shooting kamehamehas from its mouth.
1;"""worth every penny for the frame rate and load times alone. the increase in quality concerning everything else is just an added bonus. I think once steam and or capcom gets their stuff together and remedies some of the horrendous disconnects from friends//fixes """"private"""" sessions the game will be a perfect 10/10. hell it had 200k+ players on day one. tldr if you played this on ps4 just buy it again it's worth it."""
1;Fun game with lots of content. Sure hunts may be frustrating. Your team mates can be incompetent. Your a hammer main who is trying to do the big bang combo on a monsters head but then a freaking long sword main keeps making you stutter. But nether the less it is a very fun game with the devs adding in free content and with the iceborne expansion coming soon there will be lots to do
1;This game is good VERY GOOD.If you haven t tried Capcom s Monster Hunter World you really should. Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay Beautiful and varied worlds So much depth to its systems Each monster is a new challenge Story is actually engagingThe fun never END....
1;EDITED They fixed the server heres ur thumbs up.The game itself is 10/10 fun and addicting ONLY WHEN U PLAY ONLINE W/ PEOPLE.That is why fixing ur server is THAT IMPORTANT because if u compare it to any other single player game this one is nothing.*Do rebind ur keys cause the default ones sucks.
1;When I was buying the game I had some doubts about whether I will like it or not but I liked the style I liked the world. So far so good ) I will agree to people who are complaining about performance because game looks to be poorly optimized but since I have decent pc Im able to enjoy. I will still go ahead and recommend this even though optimization is bad.
1;Really fun game overall. The availability to play with friends is a bit limited but not enough to make the game unplayable. If you want to enjoy the game to 100% you should get the Console version. But the PC Version is still playable and fun with friends.
1;Thanks capcom for porting this to pc but the online multiplayer please fix it.It always disconnect and showing 5028f mw1It's not funny when you half way hunting and disconnect the monster stay strong meanwhile me only player to fight with it.Pro 1. It's monster hunter with better gameplay2. Graphic is goodCons 1. Multiplayer keep disconnect (not even fix it)2. Halfway hunting can disconnect too3. Connection again
1;Played many MH games since Freedom unite.I've had 0 crashes 0 fps issues on my setup Ryzen 7 1700xNvidia GTX 1080 2 fan FTW2The only negative I can really say about the game currently is that G rank is missing as well as many connection issues. Despite these problems I will have to say that the game is really good for both new and veteran players and would be even more enjoyable once connection issues get fixed to play with friends/other people.
1;A great game. A little easier than previus entries due to greater player power and mobility in general. Great shame it is in such a poor technical state. Remember how bad Dark souls ran? Remember how great Dark souls 2 ran? Lets hope Monster hunter world 2 (or howerver they decite to call it) will take note from From software. And add more difficult enemies.
1;MH W was well worth the wait it's difficult rewarding and most of all well fun now that multilayer issues seem to be resolved. The wide range of weapons provide a playstyle for everyone and levelling a weapon (not the character's str dex luck etc) gives you the ability to swap weapons at any time and continue your play through unhindered.The chase for better gear seems long and enjoyable so I better get back to it! May the sapphire star guild you.
1;if you like solo monster hunter this is ing amazing. it's all the good bits of monster hunter and none of the trash like underwater monster hunting *puke*if you have never played the series before try out a cheaper game in the series before you buy this since monster hunter isnt at its best until like 40 hours in.if you wanted multiplayer then i guess you could just keep praying for a patch because the constant connection drops in this game makes co op suck a fat one
1;Phenomenal game. Have played the PS4 version for a couple hundred hours and it's amazing how much smoother the PC experience is. Load times are barely there with an SSD I can keep a solid locked 60 fps with an i7 4790 K RX 580 8gb and 16 gigs of RAM at settings that while not maxed out still look way better than the Ps4 version.
1;I have had no performance issues anywhere after tweaking my settings a bit the mouse controls feel good. Default keyboard controls aren't very good but everything is remappable. Gameplay is very fun. Lots of tedious mechanics from old Monster Hunter games are gone so there's more time for just hunting.
1;Don't play this game with mouse &amp keyboard because it's clunky af. Wanna know an example? Play Charge Blade with mouse &amp keyboard and feel the cancer. Previous MH titles were either played on handheld or controllers. This game is clearly not made for mouse &amp keyboard despite being a PC port. #BringBackRajang
1;It's an excellent game but the port could be better ... It's not as bad as people make it up to be Dark Souls was way worse in that regard.If you've got an i5 8600k and a GTX 1050 you can run the game just fine on low with true 1080p at around 50 FPS.
1;Coming from an Old MH Player the game at its current state is pretty good and a lot of fun to play with friends with. Though there are still some Optimization issues but other than that it runs smoothly on my system on Mid/High. Monster Hunter World is indeed grindy game but thats the fun of it and really a joy to play with the new mechanics they added.
1;This game is truly fascinating with you as a mighty fighter destroying those big bad monsters.They might scare you from time to time as they come charging trying to kill and rip you into a thousand pieces however as you show them who is the real boss you know that this game changed you.I showed friends and others in multiplayer how a true man is.
1;It's a FUN game it's just lacking some features that a PC port should have (I.E. more in depth graphics options).It's also currently suffering from an issue where some people just can't launch the game due to an issue with certain CPU's and GPU's but that is fixable and according to Capcom the devs are working on a fix now.
1;Monster Poacher World teaches you the importance of sustainably preserving an ecosystem by allowing you to infinitely farm various legumes such as pickles right where they grow so magnificently that they even spew out Coke when you squeeze and love them just hard enough.10/10 on release will be 11/10 once the (free) pickle DLC made its way to PC.
1;A huge improvement since good old PSP days. It's totally playable solo yes it need performace tweaks &amp dependable servers... But besides that HOT DANG this game is realllly awesome ! I'm a veteran and mostly play solo all the way to G Rank missions so for now I don't really care much about multiplayer. Git gud.
1;PROS addictive tons of depth lots of different weapons types with unique playstyles multiplayer is fun bosses are challenging but rewarding crafting system is good graphics are nice mods are supportedCONS hitboxes can be buggy at times cant skip cutscenes dialogue can get annoying cant customize characters body (only face/hair)
1;It's fun. The port runs very well I get a solid 60 fps in 2560x1280 with everything maxed out (mid high end PC). Controls great with a gamepad wouldn't bother attempting it without one.I've had lots of connection issues connecting to one specific friend but haven't had any multiplayer issues at all with anyone other than him. Also just the way that multiplayer is designed makes any kind of co op during the main story a pain but... who plays MH for the story?
1;Product received for free. Ignore the whiney people downrating this game they obviously don't know how to operate PC's.I bought it on Xbox and a friend gifted it to me on PC. It runs infintely better on PC controls aren't bad. (Why aren't you using a controller anyway?)I've seen a lot of FAR worse PC Ports this game had a fine launch just as it did for console.
1;A game that has taught me about the importance of proper levelling and resistance management.Seriously f*ck the first Nergigante fight. Spent 30 minutes beating that as*shole three and a half f*cking quarters to death then he just dive bombs my as*s like a special ed kid at the pool.
1;I want to take this time to apologize to my school my family and my friends and anyone else who is going to believe that I m dead for as long as this game is out there. Very fun runs well on my PC and my machine is not by anymeans top of the line. Great progression customization and above all challenging combat. Loving this game!
1;Spent 500+ hrs on PS4 and now this!!This is kind of the game you can easily spend 1000 hours on itThe dev keeps updating free contents. Performance For me it's pretty good with i7 6700K + GTX1080 with controller supportI'm using Dualshock4 and I don't need to use any external mapping programs but the button layouts are XB1's but I'm okay with that.
1;amazing game been loving everything from it so far!this game had some issues with connections but they are working on those and for me personally there gone for most of the time being.this game is great in many ways also i have met many new friends in a discord community.https //discord.gg/ZVgyVgtry it out.See you soon
1;There are definitely some issues with this title's multiplayer functionality and frequent disconnects are definitely a thing. However when all is running smoothly this game is amazing...I've been no lifing it with friends in Canada and the US since release and I've felt both challenged and rewarded.When the connection issues get ironed out it'll be a 10/10 for me &amp easily Game of the Year. Until then its an 8/10.
1;&gt be me&gt new to Monster Hunter&gt open up Monster Hunter World&gt choose insect glaive as class&gt work my way up through the story&gt get Black Diablos quest&gt try to hunt it&gt manage to get it to turf war with a barroth&gt excited as &gt they back up and charge into each other&gt barroth took it like a &gt barroth limps away while diablos turns to me&gt never abandoned quest faster before in my life&gt sweaty af&gt 10/10 would never mess with a black diablos again
1;Product received for free. Great game I'm a huge MH fan. However the cut scenes and intro sequence is way too long I just wanted to drop in and play with friends but I had to play through 10hrs of campaign before that was a viable option also the multiplayer is verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry buggy at this point.
1;Connection issues aside it's a solid game QoL changes are nice (with the exception of the ability to get new items at camp) and all the weapons including the newly added Charge Blade are fun to play with but at the same time monsters are a little too easy so we will have to wait until Lunastra and the evil pickle Deviljho get added. Game would be amazing if it had G Rank.
1;played monster hunter on the psp a decade ago and never finished it.played monster hunter world on the pc 2 weeks ago and finished it.great game good pacing never letting me down. but beware of the op monster. his power drops frames. 4th wall breaking. amazing.so many hours into it i still haven't found an attack gem tho
1;EDIT THE CONNECTION IS FIXED THIS MAKES THE GAME 50% MORE PLAYABLE.The game is good now we just wait for patches that may or may not come to improve performance and mouse issues.Turn off volumetric rendering though. It trades what looks like an awful gray filter for 20 FPS.
1;Most of the negative reviews are coming either from the launch of the game when the servers were horrible (fixed) or losers who have nothing else to do but put 700+ hrs into a video game and then complain that there's no end game content (sad!).It's great play it.
1;I love this game I really do. Unfortunately it has some major connection issues when trying to participate in online play. I've caught word that they intend to do something about it That alone would make this game a hundred times better but until that happens trying to hunt with friends is nothing less than frustrating.
1;monster hunter world. basically a solid monsterhunter game on steam!negative reviews here are mostly salty because of little network issues.like the game its fun farming a lot. story line takes like 40 hours if you take your time. post game content still okayish!only sad thing is list of monsters in this game is pretty small in comparison to the 3ds titles and mhgu.
1;Hallo everyone.I make this just to say that the keybord and mouse are working just fine i have no problem with it at all and the game is running super good on a nvidia gtx 980Ti i have no lag at all and i have maxed out the grafic i will say that it is the best game that have come out so far on steam and. Thank you capcom for making our dream come true.
1;After the online connectivity and mouse control fixes I can definitely recommend getting this game. Good combat lots of weapons co op character customization wiggler head. This will almost certainly be my game of the year.Note As of November 2018 the content update schedule is really exploding. I hope it stays ACCELERATED like the devs promised so we can catch up with the console version.
1;A good and solid experience 30 hours of fun in just 3 days so far sure it has some problems in multiplayer but they are not a deterrent to buy it for sure since it's more likely to be a server overload problem just like in the ps4 launch.EDIT In the last patch the Multiplayer problem was fixed mostly I have played 5 hours straight with friends and still no disconnect issues
1;First impression playingNice game and the graphic so smoothly for me _ Update after playing 500 hoursOkay being a player who wasting time to half 1k hours kinda bored becasue the update kinda slowly hope Lunastra and Kulve Taroth coming out as soon as possible.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter game and it absolutely rocks!Pros Easy to pickup the basics Good unique list of weapons Combat is great! Multiplayer is great when it worksCons Multiplayer is unstable. Its prone to disconnect. Keyboard + Mouse support is not good. Mouse movement is not smooth and the default keys are confusing.
1;If you enjoy killing researching the local wildlife this one is for you peeps. Loooove me some of that sweet sweet MonHun genocide researching goodness. Best part is you can use your victims research studies as parts for some badass armor and go slay meet the now orphan sad kids looking like their mom a real fashionista.
1;Monster Hunter World is a great addition to the series. It easier then the rest of the games merely because of the fact it has less clunky controls. MHGU feels like fighting the controller as well as the previous games. MHW is truly the next gen upgrade Monster hunter needed. I hope MH5 is in this engine but has all the content of MHGU or MH4U. This is a great jumping in point to the series.
1;Game is honestly stunning probably my favourite Monster Hunter game so far. Performance on my i5 4590/RX580 had been smooth except for some slight frame skips when elemental weapons proc.Multiplayer is very spotty at the moment however the game is still strong when played alone.
1;Amazing game! Writing this at roughly 300 hours of game play if you're having troubles slaying monsters remembers to keep upgrading your weapons and armor look for builds and make sure to use decorations. very fun. just wish the PC version would catch up.
1;Apart from the over the top salty fanbois having a fit being behind on content i'm enjoying this immensely. My first MH game and i can see why it's really popular over yonder.Playing on gamepad but used K+M for the first 40 hours and they weren't that bad. There's even a patch announced to further improve keyboard and mouse controls.I like it. And I definitely will also be checking out Generations Ultimate on the Switch.
1;God damn it I can't believe that people are still giving a bad review right after a port console to pc has just been released. Instead of giving a bad review because you have issues with the game just ing wait till they fix it at least this game is a really good game but performance issues can happen when a game just released give them at least a little bit more time till they fix all those issues ffs...Btw I'm running on a gtx 1060 6gb and i7 6700k no issue so far just a very demanding game.
1;Great game with Bad server I would still recommend it to my friends. But plz fix the servers I am now getting so tierd when either me or other players just randomely got DC. It's now more like a single player game there is the option to play with friends but it just does not worth trying to connect for an hour and still could DC anytime it somehow really ruined the gameplay. JUST FIX THE SERVER and the game is 100% perfect.
1;people can be monsters too!yes the game has had connection issues in the first couple days. yes it was kind of annoying. yes it is already getting better and no it was not worth being legitimately upset about.This game takes the fun parts from the previous games and eliminates almost everything that made them annoying. Very happy to see the series making strides to refine the mechanics rather than just pile on more content.
1;As an old Monster Hunter veteran the game feels refreshing and beautiful on every corner of the world. Yes it had a rough start for this PC version but with the latest patch release couple days ago I have not experienced any lagg or issue with online gameplay in fact I played over 6 hours on 3 days in a row and 90% of the HR quests I played were online with upto 4 players with not issues or whatever. A truly challenging way to hunt down monster and kill some time. Highly recommended!
1;An absolute masterpiece this game is fantastic and probably the best monster hunter game in the series. If you rated this game badly because it didn't run on your computer or bugged out then just buy a better computer and don't blame capcom for you not having a good PC.
1;Never had connection issues Never had a bug occur Never had a crash my pc sucks i don't know how everyone keeps having problems. Gameplay is great I have not finished the story (nearing the end) but its about what i expected (go here fight big boi go there catch big boi) Optional missions and investigations mix things up having you hunt multiple monsters and what not to get qol stuff. Would reccomend using a controller movements feel better than keyboard+mouse
1;I love this game so much but I wish you could throw the insect glaive at a monster and in later versions it having a cool effect based on which ever path you went down. Like having it summon a lightning bolt at the last stage if you went down the electrical version.
1;This game deserve better review. After deviljho update the connection seem become better. Even I'm still facing connection issue and the game will freeze a few second sometimes. The gameplay is fun. Hopefully Capcom will improve it in the future and I really need Nargacuga in MHW. lol
1;And excellent game haven't played Monster Hunter since Tri on the Wii and I'm having more of a blast here than I ever did before.My only complaint is the terrible optimization for PC's this is the first game I've ever had trouble running since it was built. Even with every setting at its lowest you'll never get full FPS and I've had a few instances my computer shutting itself down due to overheating which has never happened before. Only buy if you're truly confident in your rig.
1;100+ hours in using HH/SNS/IG/Lance/GL and it's great. Biggest problem(s) I have are the horrible texturing and optimization issues both performance and connection issues. Other than that it's been a great journey. Also I'm HR 100 so will anyone farm Sapphire's Guidance with me?
1;Awesome. I never tried a Monster hunter world game before however I am truly enjoying the experience. I don't really usually enjoy games where you often have to grind the same missions for rare items just to grind more in the future for more rare items. However every round of monster hunter feels different and it is really fun too constantly being slaying monsters for that new greatsword you want. I recommend this game to almost everyone and worry about getting addicted!!!
1;I'm a new player in the Monster Hunter franchise and I must say that the gameplay is pretty solid.However this game faces serious connection issues.For those who have issues with fps drops try rollback your NVidia Driver to 398.36I recommend this game if you don't mind playing solo for awhile.
1;This sounds and looks like a great game but it wasn't working for me. When I open it it opens showing a normal window but it is completely black. Then it would load for 5 minutes then say it has stopped working then close. Then the update to try and fix it came and my results were the same even after the fix. And putting it's priority as high as possible. Please fix this. Besides that issue I would recommend it.
1;Big fan of the franchise and an even bigger fan of the quality of life changes made in World. Since they fixed the communication issue all I'd really like right now is HDR more large monsters and the option to skip cutscenes (I've played through all of the content available on the PS4 and Xbox One versions).
1;"""For those who are having trouble connecting with friends because it displays """"Failed to connect"""". Make sure you and your friends have watched the cinematic individually then you can play together. Another thing to keep in mind is that when you join someone else's room and the host leaves everyone in the room will disconnect. So when you hunting with friends make sure you host a room. Overall the game is enjoyable. The co op system sure needs some fixing but it's still playable."""
1;This game deserves better than a mixed rewiew currently it's gone through a couple of connection issues but that is to be expected since it is the first Monster Hunter to be on pc but after the recent patches I can say it is definetly worth the buy for any Monster Hunter veterans or anyone wanting to get into the Monster Hunter games!
1;This game is worth the money Guys and Girls. Don''t hesitate to buy it and support the developers.I'm a long time fan of MH games and all I can say that this is the best in terms of graphics and QoL improvements. With these we all know that the difficulty of the game will lessen. But every generation of MH games become easier because of the improvements.Enjoy the game. You can finish the main story and even the optional quest solo.
1;I can only comment on the gameplay since i have not had fps issues that a lot of the negative reviews are about and all i can say this is a an amazing game and also very pretty.There are currently occasional disconnects that the devs are trying to fix i havent had many of these but they are very annoying.I would say if you think you can run it give it a try its great.
1;Very fun very smooth both gameplay and optimization wise. I can run it on a laptop with no issues and have been playing with keyboard and mouse so far with no issues at all. The connection problems are a tad annoying but I mostly play solo so it doesn't affect me much.
1;Incredibly fun game once you get the hang of it. Not for everyone but if you have no problem with grinding then give it a shot. This entry is perfect for newcomers to the series and is easily the most accesible and user friendly Monster Hunter game to date.
1;Worth the wait. Went in blind (yes dodged EVERYTHING for the 7 months it was out on console) and my friends and i enjoy it thoroughly. My only problem with the game is that progressing with friends through the main story is wonky since you have to watch all the cutscenes together. Everything else however is fine to me. Also it is optimised very well. Good job Capcom
1;Played 700hours on the console version waiting for this pc port. The game series I love through out the years finally on steam. Playing it on all high settings but still waiting for the multiplayer fix it's still buggy. Im currently hunter rank 51 and almost 60 hours gameplay as i write this review.
1;Its a good game but it does have some annying things like my fps dropping to 30 when somoene uses a lightning weapon loosing connection to servers and having to change the resolution settings everytime i get on because if i dont i get 2 black bars on the side of my screen these can all be fixed and i hope they do
1;If you understand how the game mechanics works and you are used to these kind of grinding games you will love it. WARNING Can make you addicted to the game!I have not had any problems beside the multiplayer connection which is already known but this will be fixed hopefully very soon. Definally recommend it!
1;The Monster Hunter World PC port had a rocky start with graphics drivers issues from Nvidia bizarre graphics settings in game and connection issues. Launch issues aside (all of which are problems unique to PC) the game is a lot of fun. The game is a ton of fun solo or with friends has plenty of content now and more to come.
1;Over 100 hours into this game. Still havent completed the main story. Sure it's had it's hiccups at start. No great game launches flawlessly. Grouping with friends was a little difficult at first but once everything was figured and the connection patch everything has gelled. My friends and I have been having a blast slaying everything in our paths
1;So despite the Online issues The core gameplay is solid. It looks gorgios as . and it invoks a sense of wonder with each new area and vista I find that I haven't felt since I was very young and picked up the Original game way back on the Playstation.Maybe pick it up once they patch her up a bit theres a Fantastic ing game in here.
1;The game is one of the BEST ive played in a LONG time.BUT the servers are so BAD i cant even find words to describe it!!!I WANT to love it because its fun and challenging but it makes it realy hard to like it when you get several error messages or disconnects on a daily base...I still recommend it because i belive at some point the servers are getting patched enough so the game runs stable. Just be aware of the flawed servers...
1;Monster Hunter World is absolutely amazing. Sure the game has some disconnect issues but it isnt bad enough to not recommend the game. It is extremely easy to join back to your friends sessions so i find it just a mild inconvienice until they push a fix through. Definitely one of the best games of the series thus far.
1;it's a very fun game. performs and loads so much better than the console version. ignore the haters they're not real monster hunter fans. rollback your nvidia drivers and your performance improves tremendously. capcom support confirmed that they are resolving the online issues.
1;Hand's down best game out there going to be spending a lot of time here regardless of what others have to say. keyboard feels werid but once you get used to it it is fun. Co op is pretty nice doe's really well if you have discord buddys. ingame mic is low so no one use's it I dont think and if you press Insert while in game it opens text chat so you can still talk to other's. The story is nice aswell map creation was flawless and looks beautiful.
1;Don't let the negative reviews deceive you.I got this game as a gift from a friend who was constantly playing it.At first I was a bit unsure. I felt like the game wouldn't be that much fun.Boy was I mistaken.The game is incredibly fun and the combat is superb.I've managed to squeeze in lots of hours in a short time and I am definetly going to keep playing it.9.5 / 10
1;I'm editing this review to positive since the connection issues patch came out and mostly fixed all the disconnects. If you have been waiting like myself to hunt some big monsters or even play a Monster Hunter game title with your buddies this game is for you... It's easy to understand the game mechanics and the gameplay is quite fluid and fun.However!Beware as this game is rather unoptimised so I recommend setting Volumetric fog at Low or even Off if you dislike the effect.
1;Can all you complaining about the poor connection stop playing the game so the servers clear up for those of us with even a modicum of patience? In all seriousness though need to get this connection/server thing sorted CAPCOM! The game is phenomenal as ever however and all three of the very different PCs in my house run it fine so not sure why so many people are having framerate issues...
1;If you're already a fan of MH games then you'll love it. It took a little tweaking to get it running smooth and the online functionality has some issues but that will get fixed in time.Definitely deserves better reviews but I'll still enjoy putting several hundred hours into the game regardless.
1;Great game but matchmaking is utter jank. The fact that you can t join a friends hunt until they ve seen all cutscenes is a joke. Then when you finally get in. You ll be 10mins into a fight and the whole group get split into single lobbies... beyond that. Great game
1;This is the greatest game ev... Connection to the session has been lost. Error 50382 MW1.Don't worry I'll rejoin again. Searching for an Online Sess..Failed to connect to session members. Error 50382 MW1.Error 50382 MW1Error 50382 MW1Error 50382 MW1Did I mention Error 50382 MW1? Great game ruined by Error 50382 MW1.Edit They actually fixed the connection problems there are still some issues with it but it's very rare.
1;Gameplay 10/10. Absolutely incredible as expected.Edit Game is now 10/10 across the board since they fixed the online issues.Runs incredibly smoothly on 6700k &amp 980ti. Maxed out settings and 60+ FPS. Just turn off Volume Based Rendering or whatever. The volumetric fog. It looks bad and kills your framerate.
1;Even if you look at all the negative reviews very few actually say this is a bad game. There are problems with the PC port but none of them game breaking. The issues are annoying at absolute worst. Capcom has a history of supporting their games post launch so I don't expect any of the issues to persist.
1;Played it on console gonna grind in PC version. Very good in terms of combat and gameply smooth and got a lot of fps in highest of settings. Absolute game meeting expectations of a fan and a gamer. I only have a bit of hard time using controller because of the default control keys so I had to configure them to my liking. Overall Excellent
1;"""Worth my waiting time when I saw it on PS4. As a monster hunter IP fan I absolutely love it. About the connection error it suck of course but please this it Monster Hunter most of your time you have to grinding alone. I am also love playing cooperative with my friend but it not that bad. If you new to monster hunter IP this is the game for you.If you old to monster hunter IP you already had it right?Beside the """"mix"""" result for bad connection this game is amazing!"""
1;Although it's not the hardcore monster hunter game we're used to the graphics and fluidity make this game amazing. You get used to the ease of use changes Capcom made and begin to appreciate them after a while. It's my favorite monster hunter yet. I definitely recommend if you're not a salty hardcore MH veteran just have an open mind if you've played a previous MH game.
1;A little less challenging than previous titles which makes the start of the game a bit more soft than you'd expect from a MH title but there are some challenging fights in there even for seasoned hunters. For newer players I expect the curve to be nice and smooth. I feel there is little else to say than that this is an amazing adaption of the series.
1;Like many Monster Hunter games before it this game is a great addition to the series. I personally have no other problems except connection issues sometimes but at the same time I get to enjoy 60+ fps beautiful gameplay that is smooth as butter. These games have always had amazing hitboxes and fun gameplay like carrying eggs! I highly recommend purchasing this game if you love progression and challenges that will never end with a multitude of weapons to learn and master.
1;Good game bad release. It's a very fun game even better playing with others. Unfortunately the game is plagued with multiple different and unfixable connection issues. When I play I'm lucky if I stay connected to the server. Even when playing alone constantly getting the MHW 83 disconnect error.I would recommend this game.. but you should probably wait until Capcom gets better servers or for the popularity to die down.Update TConnection issues resolved. Great game.
1;I love the game and its one of the best ive playd. But ing hell man. After killing the final boss of the game I get a bug that dosent let the final cut scene finish and it crashes. Please for the love of god I want to keep playing the game but IT DOSENT LET ME. If someone has an answer to this problem then please help me. I have more than a 100 hour already and it feels really bad that this is happening now. PLEASE HELP.
1;Works well for me even with a computer below recommended specs at 1080p for the first 12 hours. All setting are set to low but for someone who came from the 3ds version of the game it still looks great to me! Game would appeal to those who like a mix of MMOs gear grinding Dark Souls esque combat and those who like to strategize for difficult fights beforehand.My specs for those curious Intel i7 6700HQ8GB RamGTX 960m
1;some time error when is try to connect to online season automatic move to offline mode it's like crash i think the serve is not stable yet. when i in online season im olso can't see another player in village maube make list player on monitor with the name it will be great so i can see how join in my room. i hope it will be fix as soon as posible.. i feel not comfortable about this problem.
1;I have yet to see ANY of the issues players are complaining about. The only issue I have seen was when I encountered 2 network errors with my friends and they were easily fixed. Gamers these days are too lazy to figure out how to work around problems on their own.
1;Like all games it's not for everyone.It's a lot of grinding and it gets harder as you go on. And a lot of people feel like it gets repetitive.But it wouldn't be Monster Hunter without it.Multiplayer is even more fun when it works. Yet there are times when it doesn't.Overall I enjoy playing it.I've been a fan of the MH series since 2007.
1;Pretty fun game be it multiplayer or solo. The story until now is a bit shallow but the gameplay is what shines the most here getting to know the monsters and learn new weapons is really fun and makes the whole experience worth every dollar. Fully recommend it grab a couple friends as well and enjoy.
1;While this game does fit into a niche type of Audience if you would like a game with a great single player challenge fun co op expierences and very extensive end game grinding fighting large bosses over and over Look no further. The servers on PC are kinda crap and still need a lot of work. PC options also aren't great BUT there is a lot of great consistently delivered content.
1;They need to implement a 'fashion slot' into the game because I'm sick of my character looking like a hobo with horns and fur randomly sticking out.But otherwise I like that I can just be lazy and let other people carry my butt and still clear all the content.
1;I dont care what people say this game has plenty of variety and challenges to do always something to keep you busy. Also runs like a loop which is a fun break from LoL recently. I give this game 5 Stars. Running on my inspiron 5675. 16Gb RAM (dual 8 DDR4) radeon rx 560 AMD a10 9700Wish there were more character skins though...
1;By reading reviews from people who got it on the release date i was expecting a worse port to pc honestly i totally recomend this game its a must have for fans of the franchise and a worth triyng for newcomers mostly if you manage to get it with an offer.
1;Newcomer to the MH series this game has 90% enslaved my soul. It would be 100% but connection issues and PC port issues are very real and The Handler is probably one of the worst supporting characters I've ever encountered in a game.Palicos are cute af.
1;It's hard to specify what this game does correctly when it does so much correctly With a Dark Souls esque combat system that focuses entirely on boss fights and a ton of variety in fighting styles this is enjoyed both solo and in groups. Don't expect a hack and slash as it might look at first glance but there's a ton of depth here.
1;Really enjoying the game has various flaws but a recent patch has addressed some of the glaring ones so I have faith they'll continue to improve on it and eventually catch up to the console releases.May want to consider waiting abit until more of the current bugs are ironed out but even with them ive pumped stupid time into this and loved it.Continues to get updates some better than others still grand.

1;After coming from the PSP and 3DS games I'm amazed to see what they could do with Monster Hunter on something more powerful almost 5 hours in and I'm loving every bit of it so far and being able to jump into other hunters quests is quite awesome. Seems like a good entry game for people new to the world of Monster Hunter.
1;I put a lot of hours into this game and I enjoyed every minute of it. The game has a variety of weapons and monsters for you to use and fight. Also the game has pretty good graphics and most the environments look pretty nice. Some cons I have on the game is I wish they would add more monsters and fix bugs on the game quicker. But overall I really enjoy playing this game and I would recommend it!
1;Fantastic game good old coop fun really cool weapons that play very different and offer a wide variety of play style . Right now there are alot of disconnects but the game did just release and server trouble on a new games first few days is nothing new. So far I very much reccomend this game but if your still unsure go watch so reviews/gameplay videos
1;Really wish they woulda included the ability to skip cutscenes for the intro. First several cinematics take about 30 minutes and having 300 hours clocked on the Xbox version its annoyingly long. Besides that the graphics improved greatly thanks to being on better hardware voice sync and voice lines match up better than the xbox version. Besides the slow intro great game!
1;Don't let all the butthurt reviews fool you. This is a good ing game. While co op functionality is not working there are very few working multiplayer functions on day 1 release. If you like monster hunter you will love this. If you're new to monster hunter you will love this. People really need to stop dropping bad reviews because of some day 1 problems that's just ing .
1;Pros + A very good learning curve for beginners new content for the returners Beautiful immersive world Sisterly Fourth Cool Fiver Gentle FourthCons Schizophrenic multiplayer matching Relatively small roster Handler No marriage option Gunlance playersConclusion Solid game. Buy it have fun with it. Don't group with players with Chinese text in their names.
1;The game itself is great bringing a lot of that Monster Hunter which I played back on the PSP to modern day. There are a lot of quality of life improvements which I like and others which I hate (I hate the weird lock camera lock on). Big problem is still the constant connection issues.I recommend this game yes but if you want to try and play with your friends its going to get frustrating.Lastly git gud.
1;Took me a while to digest the game. This tittle is like driving a foreign vehicle everything seemed backwards and unintuitive at first but after a while it just clicks. It s a bit rough around the edges missing some pc settings no hd textures but steam is not getting a game as polished as this for years in this genre.
1;Not the most challenging Monster Hunter game not by a long shot and very very strongly lacking in endgame. However it's a great introduction to the series and while it goes over the top on making the hunters way too powerful to the point where the monsters feel like they're at a disadvantage it's still very fun.It is a monster hunter game so expect to have to grind if you want armor or weapons and expect there to be mechanics the game doesn't tell you about.
1;Its definitely not for everyone but if you like boss rush kind of games with a bit of grinding this might appeal to you. However the first hour or 2 might be a bit boring and the game wont be as fun if you go at it alone. Make sure you have friends to play it with to maximize the fun you will get from the game. You can play with randoms online but it will still be more fun when playing with people that you know or at least talk with even when not playing the game.
1;Amazing game. Terrible servers. I will change this review to positive once the servers are fixed.Edit Haven't had any issues with servers lately. Not sure if they did something but as promised this review is now positive. ) I love this game as I did the previous MH games.
1;Monster hunter world is a different experience from the past monster hunter game for example the environment interaction the monster fight with each other and the map is huge!! This game will definitely be another great experience. I kinda miss velociprey though (
1;After hundreds of hours on console I picked up the PC version and this is the definitive version. A smooth 60fps makes a great game even better and I'm having a blast replaying this content. I waited to pick this up until they ironed out some of the bugs and I haven't had any issues with the PC version at all. I highly recommend this.
1;This game is great if you have a good computer. If you don't then sucks for you. Go buy a good computer. If you're poor I have recommendations 1. Stop it.Network errors were and are being addressed DLC is probably going to be oncoming since they can force download monsters unlike what was done on nintendo systems because steam allows more freedom as does Sony albeit not much better than nintendo.
1;Absolutely amazing the multiplayer is currently having a lot of problems but gameplay wise 10/10 skill based game graphics 10/10 made me tear up when I first saw the beautifully crafted world the monster AI is very realistic and the game is very immersive(Day/Night Cycle Monsters fighting each other and doing other stuff not much more can be said verbally since this game can only ever be judged by experience.
1;i am editing my previous review to state that the connectivity issues have been fixed. Me and my friends have had many hours of just plain fun. this is probably one of the best multiplayer games on the market. It can be played completely solo and is still just a fun as well. ignore the negative reviews for the connection issues its been patched and fixed.
1;It's Monster Hunter on PC and gameplay meets all expectations. I haven't gotten much if any lag at all but graphics can be disappointing in some settings. Need to fix the random disconnects in multiplayer servers and matchmaking is sub par. I'm optimistic it will improve with time and so far am having fun with the game.
1;"""Just the right amount of challenging. Soloed the game because day one online co op was impossible but it had the satisfaction of getting past something challenging without the darksouls """"if the game wants you dead you will die"""" programing. had a fun time"""
1;I've been a monster hunter fan since it launches in psp. Pre order MHW and I'd sure it is worth my waiting and beyond my expectation. Improved combat system and graphic quality makes the game play alot of enjoyable. However this game is not mouse+keyboard friendly nor is the muti player connection stabliity.
1;I've been playing Monster Hunter since the PS2 days the game has never felt this smooth and looked this pretty.I'm 38 hours in and haven't seen any bugs crashes glitches.. whatsoever.If you too are a long time fan of monster hunter but are on the fence then don't worry about it.It's amazing! Lots and lots of QoL improvements (including some things to make it easier on the new players)My new favourite game of all times.
1;Monster Hunter ReviewPros Nice Graphics Great Combat Monster Design Controller Support Cons Terrible Co Op Experience Turn off Volumetric Rendering to boost FPS. No 21 9 Support (I have a ultrawide monitor so this is extremely annoying.) Hopefully a decent mod will come out.Final Review 8/10 Will update this post when I complete the game.
1;This is one of those games where i say this is the last quest and before i know it i go from 3 hours to 14! So far this game has been a blast and i would recommend this. But if you can get this on console over the pc seeing as the pc version has DenuvoDRM.
1;"""If you want to smash some skulls and have fun throwing your weapons around and shooting stuf up and doing tons of dmg and having fun with others and do missions together than this is a game for you if you like to have a go at some big monsters and see what you can do than this is a game for you sure i only got 12h but all thoes 12h were 12h of pure fun and enjoyment.""""Worth every euro i payed for it"""""""
1;recommend this games because im love this game but what the hell with the datasave local save?after change to another pc loss all the savedata?capcom know how to make a pc games?this games is publish on steam now so just let the savedata link to steam cloud not hard disk
1;Only haters would give this game a negative review D Seriously I love this game. It's different to everything else in a good way. The connection issues got fixed everything works as it's supposed to do and now there is nothing to complain about.I hope people change their negative reviews to positive. Many of them did it becouse of the connection issues which have been fixed by now. This game deserves a far better rating.
1;Product received for free. System CPU AMD FX 6300GPU AMD RX 470RAM 16 GB 1333mhzLoading game off 7200 RPM Drive OS on SSD.The game runs really well displaying at 1920 HD. There is a little frame drop during high intensity moments but otherwise 60 fps pretty consistently.Multiplayer is easy to use but needs to be looked up about how it works on Google.
1;"""Anyone that says """"This is the worst MH ever made Ive played the game for thousands of hours on the other games"""". Is lying.This game has drastically improved annoying mechanics such as having to carry pickaxes and nets. It also adds some great mechanics such as vigorwasps and an eviroment that can be used against the monsters you hunt.Negatives Denuvo Motion Blur Mouse Acceleration Hard to do campaign mutiplayer (but regular quests work fine in mutiplayer)."""
1;It's basically Bloodborne 2we got doggo in rotten valegot the Hunter Axe Kirkhammer and Ludwig's Holy Blade in the form of the Charge blade and Switch AxeVaal Hazak is a Bloodborne bosswe got the Rifle Spear combined with the Stake Driver plus a giant shieldIt's like Bloodborne on pc
1;Good game for the Monster Hunter series very nice QoL from previous games. Assigned quests the story section of the game still contains the issue of having to watch a cutscene before others can join.Denuvo and some CPU/GPU/drivers will cause issues issues thankfully I have not experienced many issues except for an occassional freeze during monster animations after a very long play session.
1;"""Net interruption issues will be fixed. They were present at console launch as well. Game is meant to be played with a controller and it controls beautifully with one. These are the two main issues people are giving the game poor reviews for so this is one of those rare cases that I recommend you ignore the """"mixed"""" reviews rating and buy the game. It's AAAwesome."""
1;Good Game so far Pros Gameplay good. Optimization good. Runs perfect on 1080P on old rig. Okay story CatsCons Keyboard config. (players need to do a lot of tweaking to make it work) Servers are up and down. Overloaded with new players. No way to kill motion blur depth of field or mouse acceleration. few bugs with mice controls for gaming mice.
1;First Monster Hunter game I've played. I'd heard of them for years but never thought I'd be into them. Not sure how this compares to the others but I love this game. I mostly play singleplayer but will do multiplayer if I'm in the mood (rarely) so I haven't experienced any of the server issues peolpe are saying.
1;"""VERY FUN GAME!All the negative reviews say the game is awesome but there is a lot of connectivity issues. This is true. Playing multiplayer is death by menus.That being said once you get used to the multiplayer """"complexities"""" it's great. Some people have more connection problems than others and I've had good days and bad with connectivity.They'll fix it eventually. But the game itself is amazing."""
1;Probably DC'd only once since they patched the server issues after the first week and that was due to my own internet. Reviews are still mixed because of the r/MonsterHunter attack but if the server issues are the only thing preventing you from buying the game know it's a lot better now.
1;This game is kinda like to make you do smash crush rip tear all those monster you see.But not without one painful flaw that annoyed the heck out of me.A communication error occurred. Error code 83 mw1 What's this? I can't even played with my friend every single 10 minutes per battle . I had to kept making Sessions in order to do this and that. Thats annoying and tedious as hecking heck.Otherwise the game is excellent and a Recommended game. Plz fix this Connection Error problem.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter game and i really like it it's fun and has a lot of content to dive in but what is bad is the already known dissconection issues putting that aside it's a very solid port i honestly had my doubts about the performance but it runs really well on a low end pc that is a bit better than minimun specs.
1;Ok so me and my friend who is a major monster hunter fan have been waiting for this game for so daimn long this is my first monster hunter game and i really think it is one of the best games ive played i got it on day of release and i already have over 100 hours in it if you are thinking of buying this game do it. it is worth the money and so much more.I R8 A Solid 8/8 m8
1;some of the monsters are reskins sadly and some of them (lucky that its just a few) have outright broken moves and/or movesets this makes it really hard not to hate some t that comes thy way. but i still cant stop playing it... (update they call a horse an elder dragon...why even live at this point?) (call me bad at this game too if you wish but im just saying)
1;Gotta balance dem reviews.Yes there are problems but most are minor IMO and server problems will certainly be fixed.I mean c'mon guys at the time of this review the game wasn't even out for 2 weeks and it's not like we are playing on the old EUW servers from RIOT games.Also I used the potential fix from reddit and since then there are no problems with online play (which ofc doesn't excuse that the problem is there).
1;Better textures better online and better m/kb support would be nice but until that happens nothing is stopping me from beating a t rex into submission with a massive bagpipe made out of the bones of the unicorn I fought yesterday. That's fun that's what I play this game for. If the first three problems are dealbreakers for you then do as you will but if that second part sounds like your kind of time grab this game and join the hunt.
1;Framerate can be choppy multiplayer experiences frequent disconnects and there have been a couple bugs but the gameplay is still extremely solid. I have high hopes that Capcom will patch the game quickly and sort the most glaring issues out. It's a brilliant game and it'd be a shame to have it ruined by some bad missteps
1;I've prayed to the Lord and he hath sent a beautiful widescreen gem to me to finally play on the PC. I've easily poured 600 hours into the PSP titles. Im expecting a lot of mileage outta this baby. FPS ranges from low 50s occasionally but mostly 60 on a i7 6700 + 1070 on 2K.
1;10/10If you don't own it you're missing out.Blind playthrough Insect GlaiveJust beat Temepered Bazel fight )Amazing game.. first monster hunter and just an amazing experience.I'm now working on hunter rank to be able to get high rank temepered fights from elder dragons like Kirin for the best weps.
1;Actual Gameplay greatPC Controls not that bad some odd choicesOnline Connectivity pretty terrible inexplicably complicated grouping system bugsWhile a number of frustrating issues detract from the experience the core gameplay is so good that I would still whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone interested in a more deliberate action experience.
1;Hello. I've had this game on my Xbox one and it plays great on pc too. These connection errors though. Also I wish there was an option to skip cutscenes for people who have played the game already. As starting over because of no crossplay and having to go through the weird story limitations while playing with friends just takes out some of the fun factor. I also hoped they would have some nice exclusive contents for pc players too. More importantly CONNECTION ISSUES? WTFish? haha
1;This game is the most fun i've had in a while in gaming i LOVE this game.Slaying monsters with your friends is the best thing ever the amount of random conversations and that feel when u defeat a new boss AMAZING.The only issue i have with this game is that we sometimes have to remake the session cuz one of us won't be able to see it or DC from it as a whole.
1;This by far is one of the best games I have ever played. With the servers being pretty much fixed now I can undoubtedly give this a 9.5/10 only reason it loses the 0.5 is because I disagree with some of the cosmetic changes they chose to go through with from previous entries in the series. It's easy to pick up hard to put down and man is it satisfying to get that first big kill or get the weapon you've been grinding for. Super big thumbs up!
1;God this game is so fun. Im not sure what to say about it if you like hunting giant monsters and upgrading loot to go do it all again it very muich is the game for you. Lots of fun gear to upgrade to play with lots of good reasons to go out for just one more hunt.
1;This game is absolutley beautiful and so in depth some times its very fast paced as you're hunting a challenging monster other times it can be relaxing as you go on an expedition and just explore as you gather materials. It isn't bombarded with DLC everything is earned which is really appreciatied and theres definetly enough content that just keeps coming.
1;A step up in the standar for a monster hunter game and while it could use some more optimization for pc (let people join via steam for gods sake) The weapons feel much more fluid than previous titles. The only issues ive encountered are some online disconnects occasionally but otherwise its been fine so far in the 65 hours ive played it so far and Im willing to play more as it patched more and if new content is added.
1;The definitive Monster Hunter for now at least. Staggering amount of content amazing visuals satisfying gameplay Bear in mind it's quite resource intensive. It runs fine on my mid tier PC but I can hear the fan whirring like crazy within seconds of booting it up. It had heavy connectivity issues at launch but it's gradually stabilized in the time since then. Still get the occasional disconnect but almost never during actual hunts so it s a minor annoyance at worst.
1;This has quickly become one of my favorite games. Connectivity problems are there but they aren't game breaking for me or my friends. As a long time Monster Hunter fan I love the new direction the games took here. It's challenging and feels oddly like less RNG than previous entries. I've been enjoying every moment and haven't been feeling like I'm grinding my face against a rock. Can't wait for the new content we're getting in the future!
1;Played the hell out of it on PS4. Was great then.Still great now With a few issues.Online does work. But you can get disconnected randomly and have to recreate the room. Squads are gone. Which is pretty lame. No ability to create Friends only lobbies now.A lot of the graphics settings do not work but somehow cause performance hits. Restarting the game to change certain settings is also pretty dumb. Considering it is 2018.
1;R9 Fury X and 4690k this game is running great on Med high settings (only noticeable drop is from the rain).Mouse and keyboard controls surprisingly well.Biggest complaint at this point is the co op for story quests but I expect that to get fixed soon.
1;New to the series and having a blast! Initially tried using mouse and keyboard but found it inferior to a gamepad.Graphics sound is great. Playing at 4k with a 1070. Just make sure to turn some settings down.Gameplay is fantastic. Being new to the series wasn't sure what to expect but having a lot of fun.Haven't tried the multiplayer yet as I want to try all the monsters solo first.Quite surprised at the low rating on steam most definitely one of the better games I've played this year.
1;"""I wish the story will be more lengthy and more monsters are available in this version like as many in MH Frontiers hehehe.Overall its a good game. Haven't experienced any connection issues just sudden fps drops but the causes probably comes from my HDD """"."""
1;The game is not without network issues and related bugs but the core mechanics of the game work and the network is stable enough to play contently with friends. As a long time fan of Monster Hunter this is the game I've been wanting since I first started playing it on the PSP.
1;Fantastic intro game for new players into the Monster Hunter Series. It simplifies and streamlines many aspects of the series' mechanics that might have been otherwise tedious or kind of intimidating. Definitely the simplest Monster Hunter title but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. Especially considering it's attempting to garner a larger player base which I fully support.
1;Deep gameplay great visuals had some connectivity issues but it's now fixed.Might be the best game of 2018 even with keyboard + mouse )Of course after some time the grinding starts.... but game's worth about 100 hours of great fun... which is much more than most titles.
1;My first Monster Hunter because I have no console and I have to say great game with a bad net code (hope they fix that soon). After 150h ingame I still enjoy grinding for weapons/gear and trophys. The only thing I miss so far is a ice biom and there are to many monsters that are weak to thunder and only a few to fire....a bit imbalanced in my opinion. Still I can highly recommend it for every fan of the genre/series and hopfe for new monsters/content to come.
1;Not sure why there is tons of bad reviews i realy enjoy this game so far good music monster alot of cool wepons the only thing i disapoint is not much monster to hunt i want more monster i dont care if needed DLC i will buy it or this game gonna dead soon so far they buff monster into 2 difrent level Tempered and Arch Tempered (power/more powerfull) or updating few mosnter like (Deviljho / Kulve Taroth / Lunastra / Behemoth from Ffantasy) Extend the game life times.
1;Absolutely Amazing Game and easy to drown yourself into with the intricate weapons and addicting combat system. The mixed reviews were caused by only connection issues at launch in Aug 2018 but was fixed after a week. Free DLCs keep coming and the community is thriving so well. Most hours I clocked ever in a game and that's saying a lot. 11 STARS OUT OF 10.
1;except some connection bugs here are there everything else is good.Edit now that they fix the connection issues it's time go give this game a try if you are looking for a good co op game to farm with your friend while getting charge by black diblo over and over again while she eats cactus and after gets bomb rush by B52 bazel bomber and cart to camp
1;HAhahahahah.... 10/10 would slowly progress here than Dark Souls.Being a fan of the series it's a great game to introduce new players still be fun for veterans and be kind enough to casuals like me to want to clock in at least 4 hours a day. Get the game if you like to fight huge monsters and wear their corpses.
1;"""This is my very first Monster Hunter that i played and i have to say i love Monster Hunter World.Sure there are a few things which are """"unfair"""" but with all that great stuff you can explore or do you kinda forget these negative things very quickly.I RLY cant stop playing this game D"""
1;Guys let me say this about the game. This is a huge step up from MHGU with HD assets and with a few minor changes to the formula. Honestly I really enjoy this game more than any other game I have played in the last 14 Years. No other game has hooked me into playing so much that I almost live of this game. Not only is it a good refurbished game compared to the other MHs its also great for first time player in the series. Even though the price of this game is $62.05 USD Its worth the full price.
1;I really enjoy this game although I love the series in general so I was going to enjoy mhw either way.I haven't experienced any connectivity issues for weeks and with the camera fix for mouse users it feels wayyy better. A big QoL improvement would be to bind the quick item menu to 1 9 rather than having to press f1 then 1 9.If you enjoy killing monsters for armour so you can kill more monsters for more armour this is your game.
1;seriously the game is great but somehow the connection error is really getting annoying everytime when we are close to taking down something it usually pops up and practically takes the kill away from everyone within the grp. when the hell can a patch be available to fix this crap?!
1;Loving it! While the game has a very serious flaw in the 20+ year old tech used for the multiplayer once you learn to get around it it runs beautifully on high settings on an old ish budget rig the gameplay loop is really satisfying (if you're into grindy games and gear progression at least) and the game world while not supported by much of a story is designed well.All in all there are a couple of very poorly done elements to the game but I'm having way too much fun to care.
1;Can I play Co op? Sure but you'll might end up solo due to connection issues.Can I hunt tons of Monster? Yes either solo or Co op (which will ended up solo).What kind of pets can I have? A cat.DO you recommend it? Unless you like solo and you're fine playing solo most of the time then yes else you might wanna look up for another game or until they fix the connection issues.Also the PC version is folowing up with the console version. So you can think bout getting it now.
1;A great addition to my favourite game series of all time. The best mechanics to date and all the quality of life and presentation you would expect from a PC version of a previously handheld series. The only issue i have with it is that the late game is mediocre compared to previous titles such as Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (though i'm hoping the upcoming Iceborn expansion fixes this).9/10 game but tempered monsters are artificial difficulty.
1;I've not experienced issues to the extent others have it's been pretty painless. Otherwise it's a fantastic MH game.The first week I got disconnected from the 2 MP attempts I tried.But now I play mostly online and never have problems with connectivity.
1;Through its early release multiplayer is almost like impossible to happen due to some network issues in the game and Steam. I am still getting occasional DCs but mostly I am doing fine. I'll be looking forward for the Iceborne Expansion of the game that was just recently announced. I hope that there will be a lot of updates this coming 2019.
1;Pros First day of HR go into SOS of dragon. Midway through hunt not one but TWO other dragons show up. Party wipes.Cons Fix yo damn servers.Update Server issues mostly fixed.It is P2P so some hunts are still laggy but thats once in a blue moon its 2018.
1;Soooo.. for those who gave it a negative review and said would change the review when the connecting issue and mouse optimization were fixed have you guys done soo?Other than that the game runs smoothly.......WITH the EXCEPTION of when your stunned and your palico comes to you thinking thats it gonna hit you but nooo it just comes to you to drink a potion.
1;Great co op MMORPG. Great action combat. 10/10 would slay the big monsters again.Experienced no PC keybinding issues or connection issues. You play for the combat the graphics/cinematics and the gameplay. You prep hunts grind monsters upgrade armor rinse and repeat. The story is paper thin and it gets tedious at times like doing dailies in WoW but you can mod that part out. Don't be afraid to change weapons. It can make the game feel new again.
1;Played a bit. Its a good game. Despite the issues the game is still a good buy.Points of Interest Core gameplay is great nothing to complain there. Connection/Server issues on Capcom's side are a huge problem they needed that fixed last week. Denuvo possibly to blame for this. Game could've used an Open Beta test to iron out these issues. Menu system is garbage could've used PC style menus and a better quality UI.
1;Product received for free. I bought this game on my PS4 year ago and I got it free when I upgrade my rig. This game is bored but when you have friends that do the hunt together it multiplies the fun for 100x.Play this game and all your free time is consumed
1;You know what time is it? Itssss review timeeeeeeeeeee!!played old MH(MH 3rd portable &amp freedom unite) for about 1000+ hours and this one is the best so far. combat is preety amazing decent graphics * * . The only complaint I have about this game is the targeting system it is really really bad I hope they fix it in future other than that game is mofkn amazing!! and its more fun to play with friends/ random hunters but hey playing solo is actually quite fun too. no regrets Money well spent D
1;Very fun game. Brings back memories of the previous games that I used to play on my old 3ds system. Not to mention that it runs really smoothly and the keyboard controls are not that hard to get used to. I'm assuming that other reviews that keep complaining about game performance just have crappy computers and need to get ones that can actually handle a game like this.
1;yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss9/10if you liked the monster hutner franchise or interested in starting on one this is one of your best choicesome crash here and there if the settings exceeed your spec and such but overallgrinddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd and enjoy
1;The more you get to know the game the more addictive it becomes. The combat is quite satisfying once you've learnt how to use weapons properly the monsters are also well designed despite still having some dumb happening at times. Though the grinding part of the game might get tedious at some point but overall a great game would recommend.
1;"""I had read it had some porting issues but since I didn't pick it up until the Autumn Sale that wasn't a problem for me. I am enjoying this game quite a bit. The graphics are great and the game is polished """"kill monsters to get more stuff to kill more monsters """" which I can enjoy for sheer mindless fun.My only material complaint is that you can't save your custom quick select circles for more than a mission before they revert to default. Boo!"""
1;I flat out love this game. Personally I have not experienced any issues.I have played monster hunter for around 10 years in various forms and this is a beautiful game to me.certainly some peoples expectations are a lot higher than mine and yes there have been issues for some. The networking issue is easily fixed you just have to look up how.back to the hunt.
1;Dont pay attention to bad reviews even when u get network errors and other stuff the game itself is beautiful smooth and perfect for sure they will fix the issues but still this game is well optimized for all MH fans this game is just what we where waiting for!I preordered it and cant be more happy.
1;multiplayer options are poopy right now because of game's recent launch.everything is good minus the artificial difficulty (i.e. having to put your weapon away to sharpen it having to put your weapon away to drink potions and many other poor design choices that make the game harder than it really needs to be.) otherwise good
1;Never played MH game before and this blow me away. Updated my review after clocking 100+ hours. I am enjoying every bit of it. Luckily i have a rig which runs at 60fps with all settings high so no issues with performance.Give Hammer a try its OP with less combos but awesome moveset and high damage.My Experience 10/10.Let the hunt begin . . .
1;Although there are a few issues with Online I would still call this (by a large margin nontheless) my favorite Monster Hunter game. From MH4U to MHGen to MHXX this just brings so many QoL changes and just plain amazing new aspects which make the others pale in comparison. Now we just need Online fixed Pickle to come over and G rank for this to be nearly perfect!This is probably my 5th favorite game at this time. I'd give it an 8/10 (10/10 when online is fixed)
1;ive played 50+ hours so far never had a promblem beside lunch day with playing anyone i love this game its one of the best game made this year i have over 500 hours on xbox hr rank plus 350 on xbox and first monster hunter ever and its hands down a 10/10 game
1;I meet all the requirements for this game I have the lowest possible settings and yet it still doesn't work. It seems to hover around the 10 frames per second mark and is incredibly slow. Bummer... but I did hear about the patch that'll hopefully fix this so I'm ready to play whenever that comes out.
1;Fantastic game. Game of the year for me logged 127 hours in 3 weeks don't do that btw take the game slow I ruined my full experience got hunter rank 100 that amount of hours played it way to fast but great game all around the servers are a bit iffy right now as I review but they are sure to be fixed seem you can't connect to people early in the morning where I live in est time zone worth your money for sure be ready to grind your butt off
1;This deserve a GOTY. Even though this is by far the easiest MH title in history and the story final boss is literally a sandbag it is still great to see MH finally releasing PC HD title. Anyone who are willing to take on a challenge and learn their way to a victory should definitely try this game out.
1;I played Monster Hunter 2 and loved it. This game is a little tough to learn but that adds to the enjoyment. PROS Able to hunt monsters. Able to hunt monsters with friends (when you figure out how to decently connect to other people) New Gear Tons of Collectables 14 main weapons to choose from. Cool Cat who aids you. (can customize him too) Seeing monsters engage with other monstersCones Quit whinning and enjoy the game. Rave
1;ive only just begun this game and so far i love it. from the creatures the characters to the weapons. its a game i can easily find myself sinking ours into. the only problem that I do have with the game is that there is no regular jumping machanic. other than that great game.
1;very good as im one of the fan since 1st MH love this game as until now with my friends. love it a lot. dont mind about the negative commend if you want to complaint should upgrade your PC before that and for connection problem it always happened since it just 3 days release what u expect? everything perfect? its good as long as they will release new update to solve this anywa GOGOGOO MHW!!!!
1;"""Port is not the best but it works. Some kinks need to be worked out but the gameplay is what really gets you. Give this game a try! It has mixed reviews atm but honestly it's just because it doesn't support 21 9 aspect ratio and having """"low"""" fps when in highest settings when Volume Rendering Quality isn't OFF. The core gameplay is really good whether you're playing solo or with your friends."""
1;An amazing agme that i recomend with my hearth i start playing since the PSP and i have to admit is just gold to me.Rework the monster graphics and implement new mechanics made the game really cool just a tipGet an xbox one or ps4 control or you will struggle with the controls if youre new just dont get youre self down if you fail a quest is normal an more if youre new on seriesnow get out and hunt '3
1;Monster Hunter on PC what more do I need to say pit's great fun has lots of QOL changes and is just the best one to jump into the series with. The PC port could be better have had a few random crashes fps drops on some Elder Dragons and don't see much point in Denuvo on an online game like this I guess some people would play it solo but it only hurts the rest of us paying customers hopefully they remove it down the road (yeah I doubt they will)
1;Don't listen to the negative reviews people are salty they were having disconnection issues which for the most part at this point are resolved. If I didn't need to pay rent I would literally play this game non stop. I already plugged 100 hours on PS4 and this version is much better due to quicker load times better textures and it just feels damn good to play with keyboard and mouse. A welcome addition to the MH franchise.No you do not need to play previous games in the series.
1;This is my first review because I couldn't help but recommend this game I preordered the deluxe version especially since as a long time MH fan (played since the first one on PS2 at 2005) it is a dream come true to play it on the PC especially this REALLY polished port.Now there were some inconveniences at launch like FPS drops and server issues but as of today it works great.I lost all of my friends to this.
1;The game is fairly ported to PC. With some issues here and there. The worst thing was the disconnection issue which was improved 2 days ago. If you like this game on the consoles you will love it as well. for me I can get more than what the consoles do such as more FPS and mods.
1;Its amazing game People are crying about connection issues they dont know when the game was released on PS4 we had to play whole story solo because of connection issues It took month to fix the problem.PC people just want stable build since day 1 .Other than that game is stable runs amazing and pretty fun.
1;You'll understand how to play in about five hours and become decent near the ten hour mark but continue and you'll have hundreds of hours of gameplay and then the gameplay of the other incredible (though clunkier) Monster Hunter games. Which have upwards of three times the monsters. And hundreds more weapons. And hundreds more armor sets. There is a LOT but do not fear for Monster Hunter quantity is not without quality.
1;Alot of people complaining about some small problems which will most likely get resolved in the future the game itself is a blast and I am having alot of fun I normally don't review games but I couldn't stand the game having a mixed rating it does not deserve that at all.
1;I played this game when i first came out and was anticipating ther PC release once i got my hand on the game i fell in love with the game again and havent stopped playing. they have released a very good port and done a great job westernising the game and is a great game for beginners to the series.
1;If you love solo games and also don't mind having a bit of help at times this is the perfect game for you. I've been playing Monster Hunter from my younger college years and never have been disappointed. It's easy to learn and pickup new weapons and figure out tricks. There is a lot of hidden detail around the game and it makes it feel like a treasure hunt sometimes. Try it out!
1;If you are looking for a challenging monster hunting coop game that makes farming items seem fun then this is the game for you. There are plenty of criticisms of this game by PC gamers but there has been indication from the devs that improvments to some concerns are on the way. This is truly the nicest looking and most fun version of monster hunter I have played and that is why I couldn't recommend this game more.
1;Don't call it a comebackI've been here for yearsI'm rocking my peersPuttin' suckers in fearMakin' the tears rain down like a monsoonListen to the bass go boomExplosions overpowerin'Over the competition I'm towerin'Wrecking shop when I write these lyricsThat'll make you call the copsDon't you dare stare you better moveDon't ever compareMe to the rest that'll all get sliced and dicedCompetition's payin' the priceI'm gonna knock you outMama said knock you outHammer experience in a nutshell.
1;A must buy! Well worth the price.As a single player game it is Great.As a Co op Multiplayer it is Best.Network Errors are a problem but has been acknowledgedMinor nuisance not deserving of negative reviews.9/10 for now10/10 once Network Errors are fixed
1;So 69 hours in... since most of the reviews have been on the connection errors and the bad console port imma say this The game is fun.I have fun playing it.It feels nostalgic on one hand but also completely refreshing on the other.So since the purpose of a game should be having fun you should try it.(Maybe imma write a more in depth review at 420 hours in)
1;The core game is so amazing that it really makes you look past the issues here and there however get used to seeingError 50382 MW1 Want to open the gane? Wait 5 min for it toconnect only to tell you its offline. Error 50382 MW1 Want to play multiplayer? Error 50382 MW1 Almost finished a monster in multi? Error 50382 MW1 Looked as the game funny. Error 50382 MW1 Capcom CEO sneezed. Error 50382 MW1
1;No Plesioth 10/10 recommendedHonestly though it could be a lot betterFirst and foremost the network errors. Fix ASAP.Mouse controls seem to be under works I play with a controller but some people still prefer mouse and keyboard so I guess it's a good thing they're trying to fix that.Textures please fix fix fix. Game looks ugly despite its demanding specs.Xenojiva game breaking bug. Please at least fix this if you're gonna hope that this game gets more than 60% on steam after bug fixes.
1;Since they've got at least one patch out the door addressing the connection issues I'll go ahead and write my positive review It's Monster Hunter the best video game series ever except you can play it on PC. If you aren't playing this game you are stupid
1;Multiplayer has some bugs atm yes however single player works 100%. Ignore the rage even if the game was perfect some people they would probably find something to complain about anyway. The game is a lot of fun and worth trying especially multiplayer (if you get it to work )
1;Many may say this game is hard this game has bag connection bla bla bla.....SHUT UP NOOBIf u think this is a bad game or too hard for u noob try monster hunter 3 portable on a phone beat to the last boss then u may come back here and maybe just maybe u can like or dislike MONSTER HUNTER WORLD ultil then SHUT UP AND GIVE THIS GAME A CHANGE AND A LIKE.
1;Best Monster Hunter to date. The only thing that is hurting it in my mind is the MP connection issues. There are work arounds to it so it isn't a deal breaker but annoying nontheless. The handling of coop could of been better. Highly recommend this game especually to fans of the franchise.
1;Game works fine even on a 2011 PC like mine AMD Phenom II x6. Does not require SSE4.1 so runs fine on chipsets unprovided of such functionality. Game runs well even on a GTX 1050ti OC between 30 to 60 fps on medium settings.I do hope there might be some better optimisation to get better fps for medium Graphic Cards.Overall its a game that will grant easily 200h+ of gameplay enjoyement.
1;Don't get confused with the negative reviews!This is a great game and I never had issues with it.I am playing with my friends online and with thelatest patch I never had connection issues.Moreoever the game perfectly runs and it nevercrashed at all with my game time 379 hours!This is truly a wonderful online game and I defitenlyrecommend to buy and play this game!Cheers!
1;"""Soooo.. steam shortcut Target """"C Program Files (x86) Steam Steam.exe"""" nofriendsui tcpEnjoy multiplayer as it seems to be steams lovely new UI that is causing disconnects Once we did this we are able to enjoy hours of co op on end we """"Dropped connection"""" to the match making session but we remained in the same online session and could continue without any further issues. Thanks steam"""
1;This game is my sort of game i love the grinding and the graphics on highest is sick.I dont like the people that hate this game is perfect the connection errors are the problem sometimes but Capcom are looking at it right now so chill... i love this game anyway )i rate this game 10/10
1;Really enjoying this game. This is my first monster hunter I play solo and have not experience any issues. I understand there are multiplayer issues but as a solo player it does not impact me. Great game and I hope more monster hunter games come out on PC.
1;i was already a fan of this series since mhf2 and this game has been my dream for many years...now it's here and even with my unrealistic expectations it didn't disappoint.EDIT continuous crashes in very important parts of missions drops of framerate w/ gtx 1070 ti...you get the idea its frustrating but it's still a great game.EDIT it seems the crashes have stopped for good! thank the gods at capcom.
1;Since i was in middle school i really enjoy monster hunter now with this MHW i really love it after 75 hours play this game is amazing after the update now we can enjoy real hunting with friend. Amazing gameplay amazing grinding and amazing time. can't wait for another update and new monster.
1;If you come from the older Monster Hunter games you will definitely like this. Most negative reviews come from connectivity issues and people complaining about graphic options and getting motion sickness. Well almost every AAA game has terrible connectivity issues even weeks after launch and the graphics are so much better if you compare to handhelds like PSP and 3DS where I come from. To me it plays like any other 3rd person game so maybe you are just weak .
1;As a player with over 8000+ hours in Playstation 2 PSP WII U in Monster Hunter games. The whiny negative reviewers are just that. I've waited 12 years since the first monster hunter ever to have a PC control game because I hate consoles. AND FINALLY I HAVE ONE.AND THE PCCONTROLSARE GOODTo the whiney console morons you're all trash and you can suck on the eiffel tower for giving this game a bad review. The world deserves better than your existence.
1;I saw Mon Hun I came. I played no regrets. I only wrote a review because this game while simpler than previous iterations of the franchise with many QoL changes is still an absolute gem. The end gamrle may be a bit confusing and tedious but it's still gorgeous.
1;I almost have 100 hours on this amazing game and it is truly amazing but i dont understand people giving this game a bad review since they can't run the game or just dont like it for simple things i absolutely love this game and my experience has been top notch multiplayer does have some issues but it from those hosting. Do not give this great game a bad review for simple things that trigger you.
1;If you like salt this is the perfect game for you if you dont like salt play some battle royale game and come back. Positive aspects bad team mates wierd hitbox bad optimisation best waifu handlerNegative aspetcs japanese team mates that make the game too easy korean dudes that speedrun the mission you post Dungpods the game makes you hurt Dodogama... NO ONE WANTS TO HURT A DODOGAMA!
1;Alot of the negative reviews are based on people with toasters who can't run the game properly. Definitely a gem of a game and the port is better than most ports from japan. Nice fluid combat mechanics the story is so so but the gameplay is what makes this game superior to similar style games. If you can run it definitely worth your time.
1;To all the people on this game. Your levels of ornery bs are so ing stupid its killing me. The bugs are minor. The learning curve is way more tiny than thousands of other games you nerds butt with good reviews like dark souls. Like jfc get past zorah play the actual content mh has always been a late game type of game. Yes the story sucks NEWS FLASH it always has. Wanting to butcher the handler is a natural and completely understandable offense.
1;Edited Review A lot of fixes applied the last few weeks. Game is now running on my current hardware fairly well. Still some odd issues such as long launch times and freezing if I remove / add USB devices but otherwise a solid addition to the Monster Hunter franchise at this point.
1;Even if there are currently connection issues it's still one of the most fun and satisfying games I've played for a very long time. It's going to be 100% worth it to be patient. Just be glad you're not on console and it only takes 15 seconds to connect to a new session instead of minutes.
1;After the changes to the networking and some tinkering with settings using a program called NvidiaInspector which I would highly reccomend to anyone using nvidia cards especially to those who have trouble with rotten vale framerates the game now sits at a solid framerate everywhere for me. That asside this is by far the easiest game on newcommers to the series so if youve ever wanted to get into the monhun series this would be the one to do it.
1;Great games where you can sink a ton of hours into. The controls are streamlines compared to the older games and the gameplay is much faster. Totally worth it if you enjoy these type of games. Dont go expecting a killer story but if you like challenging games with a lot of grinding then this game is for you. Now we have to wait for the updates.
1;Game had some major issues when it came out but was still playable. In less than a month they have fixed almost all the major issues (connectivity and mouse control). The only thing they haven't fixed 100% is some of the textures in PC but they are almost unnoticeable.
1;I have played on PS4 then on PC.It is a great monster hunting game and I recommend it.The gameplay is satisfying and the graphics are modern despite the game being greedy CPU and GPU wise.If I had to say something negative about it it would be more about the genre.This kind of game becomes repetitive after a few dozens hours and the enjoyment is slowly traded for completionism.
1;500+h on Console and now 100h on PC still cant get enough if you run out of things too do in this game you still can tryout a new Weapon witch can chance your game experience.Its an unforgettable adventure witch brought me and maybe many other people into the MonsterHunter series.
1;Just going to put this out there. First game in a long time I feel I can devote many hours to. More content being added. Community is active in trying to make harder content. All in all a solid game that is released not in alpha state for once. Worth the money.
1;Networking deficiencies and hardware issues aside Monster Hunter World truly offers an experience that is both unique and satisfying. This game has consumed my life for the month of August leaving me with little desire to play anything else. If boss battles are your thing then look no further.
1;It's been said before but if you played Dark Souls and wished every fight was a boss fight this is the game for you. Oh and the connectivity issues have been 90% resolved so you can actually play with others now.100 hours played at the time of writing.
1;Great game most of the issues regarding online connection are resolved now it's only some frame drop issues left to solve. This game is great higly addictive and super fun wether you play solo or in a group. There's so much depth to the weapons monster gameplay that you might have to figure out yourself or look up online. But for me exploring and discovering things are part of the monster hunter experience happy hunting!
1;I originally wasn't happy with this game and it's multiplayer connectivity issues. However this has since been resolved and I have had several long gaming sessions without a single drop out occurring. I've put over 150 hours into the game (incorrect on Steam due to some offline play) but I'd rate this game the highest I can.
1;Currently got 105 hours on this and I've loved every single one. A very skill based game and at time of review it seems to be running to where I experience few to no disconnects from online and have a very good time finding or playing with other people when I desire.
1;"""""""Why delay the game more than half a year and not actually prepare for the release? The servers are always down so it's impossible to play with other humans. What a garbage port.""""That WAS my review before they fixed the servers so you can play multiplayer properly. Pretty good game 3"""
1;The kind of game that make your hands wet from sweat. Every fight is intense and feels like boss battle. Fluid animation good level design decent difficulty and a unique game on its own. Although PC port and its multiplayer is a bit unstable you will forget all of them when playing the game.Is good wether you are casual or hardcore. Great to play on single player or with friends.
1;Great Game! And Who care about network issues!?I'M A SOLO HUNTER SINCE MH2!!*EDIT 20/09/2018 Now that's network problems are gone.I'm make it to the end game and still recommended it.currently the end game don't have much to offer but it still fun doing a couple of hunts per day.
1;this game is fun to pop into random SOS quests and just kill monsters but shines at its best when in a discord with friends having a blast please keep in mind that pc updates come later because capcom isnt used to pc but the updates a re coming i highly recommend 10/10
1;Dont listen to the bad reviews. This game is so amazing ive played alot of games in my time and this is some quality that shouldnt be overlooked. Yes is has a few minor bugs and can be confusing to grasp but once you do its legendary. If you are a little baby i recommend this game. )
1;Game is a fun multiplayer experience. Solo isn't so great but it's playable. Had some issues at first with connectivity and some minor fps issues but they released a patch fixing the 50382 MW1 error (As of August 26 I haven't encountered this error ever again) and are currently working on further PC optimisation so that's good. Overall this isn't as bad as a port as everyone is making it out to be.It's still a better port than Mighty Number 9 anyways.
1;Haven't had this many issues staying connected to a lobby since For Honor hopefully they fix it because it IS a fun game.And here I thought they delayed it so they can give us a good port from the get go.EDIT They have now addressed the connection issues that I initially disliked about the game. You can now enjoy getting pummeled by bagel goose with your friends would recommend.
1;The game is now a superior port in every way thanks to them actually fixing the network issues other than the fact we're behind in updates like Deviljho etcAlso use mods like Transmog armor if you don't want to look like a clown just because you want a specific build.
1;This game is amazing!! It is the boss fight game! So much action and so much to do. Loads of weapons to choose from and the gear sets are unique. The monsters are challenging yet fun to fight. One of my favourite games by far. It may have some frame drops during a couple battles but overall the gameplay and vast amount of things to do deserves a thumbs up.
1;Finally on PC!not limited to the 3DS runs super smooth and makes a ton of fun alot that helps out if your new to the game and helps you with collecting ressources its Monster Hunter how you love it it feels like it and plays like it with the taste of a helping hand which feels fine by me short in short i can fully recomment it.&lt 3
1;My very first Monster Hunter Game I'm actually impressed by the variety of weapons and possible different playstyles. Every weapon also seems to be used by players there ain't a single weapon that seems entirely pointless. Having lot of fun with the game so far playing online works pretty good at this point aswell can recommend.
1;The monster hitboxes are and the internet connection thing must be fixed this is an online game its frustrating and stupid to go alone against strong monsters in early mid game.Ofc the game is really beautifull and all but those are issues that need to be fixed fast.
1;The whole game aspect r rock solid for both new and veteran hunter like. Still hopping on multiplayer session are near impossible and incosistent as welll (the SOS/riin choice r too few for a game that has 150k+++ average population)Update The whole mp session is still got up and down but at least i could play properly with my brother today. Also the game has UNOFICIAL TRANSMOG MOD!!!! HUZAAAAAHHHH
1;Great game but don't buy until the network error is fixed. I'm getting disconnected from other players 2/3 times then you get left with a 4 player scaled monster solo. Optimisation is really really bad as well if that's a concern for others ). When fixed I'll change to recommended**Edit seems like some of the disconnection problems are happening a lot less now (still a few occasionally) so it's playable now. Optimisation is a concern but otherwise amazing game.
1;I've played 200 hours on PS4 and I still buy this just to play with my friends. And guess what? The thing I bought this version for doesn't works! I can't even go to the same session as my friends not even trying to go for any quests yet.Will not recommend this game until Steam/Capcom fix this issue.Edit The connection issue occurs less now.
1;the network connect error is freaking annoying where we are losing our patient to play it although it has been long await. if you dont mind to play it sololy .... frequent disconnect ... unable to detect friends online ... then this is your choice.__________________________________________________________________________Recently fixed 95% connection error i remain my previous comment as it was reacting slow onto problems.
1;Not the best monster hunter (yet)but not bad for PC port.Still need a lot of improvement in terms of graphics and performanceI am running 1080p resolution with GTX 1070Ti the FPS drops to 40 on Jungle area.Other than that they fixed (80% safe) of the network issue Yes this is for casual monster hunter.
1;Really awesome after a month after the game release. Almost all issues are fixed.If you are having disconnections issues still and have done all the dmz portforwarding and etc...Try the cloudflare dns 1.1.1.1 and secondary 1.0.0.1And to people that say that people dont change their review. Well here I am I changed my review.
1;OK This games great however be prepared to spend 26 hours trying to get a specific item because sometimes it happens. Also the hitboxes are a little janked up. The story's also pretty mediocre. BUT BUT BUT the game is still fun the combats fun and when has a monster hunter game ever had a good story? its just fun Idk what to say.
1;Well it is a good game on ps4 but porting it to pc has more problems like frequently dc after several quest together. Tbh example like re6 capcom product has the most connectivity issue. Which i do presume it is because the data record we played is linked to the capcom server. They really need fix this But about the game itself im surely don't have to explain myself. The title already explains what this game is. Even some people called it jurassic park rpg lul
1;I am a bit biased because I am already a fan of the Monster Hunter series but so far this game is amazing. Tons of little quality of life improvement from previous titles that make the game feel really slick and complete.Pretty graphics fun combat interesting new mechanics. Running a solid 60fps at max settings.The only cons I can think of are no ultrawide support poor mouse+kb support and some slightly lacking graphics options.
1;With the fixed netcode the core game of MHW is great.The only negatives that come to mind are issues with graphic drivers (I had to rollback to Nvidia 398.82 avoid crashes have been crash free since). And a lack of toggles for certain options such as DoF (you can minimize the DoF by turning off the volumetric fog but that sucks if you like the effect the volumetric fog brings).
1;I had fun with this game compare to other Monster Hunter it is easier to get into but still require online research to learn to play. It can be played on Mouse and Keyboard but I just like Xbox Controller. The bad news is that the pc game isn't updated or focused like it's console siblings. It feels like we are second class cilizens but I still recommend this game for anyone who like Challenging Solo/Co op Boss fights.
1;After a long awaited return Monster Hunter is finally on PC again. Most people here are putting up things on network issues and yes matchmaking could be a hell of allot better but that does not take away that it is a solid fun game. If you like Souls type games then welcome as this would be it's father.
1;OMG guys this is litterally the best game i have ever played but like the game just came out and there is one problem it disconnects me from the game every now and then LIKE OMG its not like it has only been out a week and this is there first monster hunter GAME on pc lol. Are people really that stupid?
1;First thing first the game is running on high fairly old rig (2 years old) no issues and fluid gameplay at 1080p.It's a polished eye pleasing and new player friendly monster hunter game heavily multiplayer oriented but still fully enjoyable by lone wolf hunters expecting to solo high rank monsters while wearing nothing more than their underwear.A solid 9 out of 10 in my opinion with gorgeous graphics and music. The gameplay is a matter of personal preference but I quite like it.
1;The latest PC patches No more unresonable disconnects never happens now after recent fixes Motion blur can be toggled Mouse movement support Better Optimisation (somewhat) Skippable cutscenes Lots of Bug fixesLack of content in terms of an entire MHW title as a whole. But it hasn't even been an year yet since release something that MHW team will take notice and possibly include a stronger endgame mechanic(s).
1;It's a great game with a mediocre port at best. The port could really improve (HD texture pack better controls for items and performance increases).Other than that multiplayer works (for me and my friends and all the SOS I did up to now) barely any bugs. Can't share a lot of problems others have.Also runs at around 80 100 fps on 2560x1440 resolution with almost maxed settings so that also works quite well for me.
1;Experienced some connection issues in online play though they are usually resolved pretty easily. Not as bad as many reviews make it out to be. Runs at stable 50 60 fps on high with my 1070 and i5 8400. Having friends to play this game with is a must to get the optimal experience.
1;The game has been made to include more beginners and causal players to play. The mechanics or the game would say around 3/5 for this port as some of the control were not thoguhtful considered from controllers to keyboard. They have fix the screen resize bug that causes the game to crash. However the game still occansionally encounters network communication error when playing in multiplayer.
1;"""Error 5028f mw1This is not acceptable for a full priced game that was delayed for over a year in order to be fully """"Optimized for PC play"""".Buy when price drops or network bugs are fixed.EDIT I believe connectivity issues have been addressed. Game gud now x"""
1;"""should rename it to """"everything is an simulator"""" or """"a million ways to die""""i can guarantee that you're going to get chained or one shotted by the most unbelievable setups possible ranging from airstrikes toads wasps and your own cattl dr mhw streamlines a lot of the tedium from the it's predecessors allowing for the more relevant gameplay of actually hitting on monsters"""
1;This is honestly one of my single favorite games there are some issues with the online mode and such but overall the game is amazing. I love playing this and just finished it recently so I am going through all of the optional quests and even after beating these monsters multiple times before I still have fun using one of the many different types of weapons each time and using abilities and combos that go along with them
1;It has all the crappy stuff from the PS4 (Like not being able to play the campain co op untill both players have seen the cutscene to that mission) but like 99% of the crappy PC stuff (Like not being able to get online and costant dicconects) are all fixed.So buy this game and go bash a pickle.
1;ed up mouse controls and weird bindings special attack is stuck connected to the interact/harvest/speak keys which should not be linked together. Disconnects from the server.They fixed the disconnects and the mouse controls. Key bindings are still not as good as you'd want for a PC title but they're fixing the ed up
1;Personally I haven't encountered TOO many connection issues. Sometimes I will disconnect from online services at random intervals but it doesn't affect my single player experience so I'm not too fussed. Other than these connection issues the gameplay and graphics are very good and it's an enjoyable game. Love the turf wars between monsters.
1;This Game is Fun STORY very mediocre in terms of actual story but its there first time making cutscenes for a story so whatever GAMEPLAY Very fun because there are a massive amount of playstylesCool crossovers like Final Fantasy Behemoth fight that forces more mmo style playAddictingYou feel powerful when you use the heavy weapons such as the Hammer (my main weapon)Large difficulty spike that can make things really hard such as Nergigante Overall I give this game 8.2/10
1;21 hours in game already i just bought this recently. This game has been eating my time. Last MH game i played was on the PSP so i can say im familiar about the game except for the new features since. I can say its a lil bit easier than previous games. I havent touched Multiplayer yet im gonna try solo first ( Currently on Rathian/Diablos Quest). The game is Hardware heavy so check youtube first for Performance of your system. Good buy for me.
1;"""*New review (thumbs up) The issues I had were fixed and now its working fine.*Old review* (thumbs down)Crashes and constant """"MW1"""" disconnects makes this a somewhat painful experience. I currently don't recommend this game till they sort that out... oh and I'm also having fps issues which shouldn't happen"""
1;very cool and fantastic game really really fun to play tons to explore fun to grind ( with friends ) .the multiplayer got kinda lots of problem atm kinda ruin the experience playing with friends but those are just temp prob .the game just got realease on pc even after the 9 month dev the MHW team still new to pc port . so just them a chance the multiplayer connection is getting smooth as i post this review. good game fun game no regret just come buy it . its a must play PC game .
1;As a veteran Monster Hunter player (since Freedom Unite) I can say that this entry is one of if not the best in the series. There is much more freedom than previous titles as well as no loading screens between the areas of the map. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do either single player or co op. This game does have a learning curve but it is an amazing feeling taking down a monster that was giving you trouble.
1;"""""""A communication error has occurred""""You're going to be getting this message a lot of the time even if you are the only person in your own online session.Edit The kinda fixed it after close to two weeks later. You'll still disconnect once in a while but it's definitely more manageable. I've had disconnects once every 6 hours pretty much so regular players won't have issues anymore."""
1;Played Monster Hunters Tri years ago on the Wii. There's a large learning curve but it's worth it. You'll have to play around with the graphic settings since it's a resource demanding game. I lose network connection once in a while but it might be because I'm connected using Wifi. The game will switch to offline mode so you don't lose your progress. This game is a lot of fun. Recommended.
1;"""Review has been modified and is now recommended as long as whoever is looking to buy the game is able to cope with these issues Cannot change specific graphical options (motion blur DOF bloom) Unoptimized performance no SLI support lack of ultrawide support (can be corrected with mods just not """"perfectly"""") texture rendering bugs simulated joystick with mouse and keyboard controlsIt's not a perfect experience but it's better than nothing."""
1;"""Don't take my """"recommendation"""" at face value I'm only reflecting my personal experience which has been fine. But as you've no doubt seen many others have been facing serious issues trying to play this game.I truly recommend the game itself but it's disheartening to see a new audience being put through all this. If you must play the console version instead. But that in turn will be playing right into Sony's hands.I love this game. But I'm saddened by everything surrounding it."""
1;3.6 hours into my pc playthrough I have to say zero complaints. I havent had any issues no pixelation no dc's no control issues. Maybe people are playing on potatoes? Obviously its a port from console so use a controller if you hate mouse acceleration. The first game I havent slammed on PC. Woot woot back to the hunt yo.
1;I bought this game to play with my friends since that was MHW is a naturally hard game. But little did I know how BAD the disconnections me and my friends has experienced and STILL CURRENTLY experiencing. such a huge disappointment. oni my 17hrs of playing i feel like 10hrs of this is just us desperately trying to play mhw with each other.EDIT Disconnections are now on a minimum. It is atleast playable
1;It's a bad port with all the things we've come to expect from a bad port sadly. Not remotely worth the 8 month delay we got.That being said the game itself is AWESOME. I've been having a blast while playing it so far. Definitely a must buy for any action/fantasy fan if you can look past it's bad port problems. 27 hours played and I have a feeling I'll easily reach 200 before I even think of getting bored with this game.
1;As a Monster Hunter fan from the PSP / PS2 era this port is amazing as far as gameplay.I do recommend holding off until they fix some of their port issues as it is sending everyone away. Once they fix matchmaking / mouse acceleration / graphical issues / keybinding this will be 10/10 for sure.
1;Xeno'jivan bug is t. Most of the complaints aside from the multiplayer crashing and disconnects are t. The only issue I have with the game is how easy it seems to be for people to hack. I haven't run into any hackers that I am aware of though. The game is great. I love it. I wish the Mouse keyboard support was better but this is about par for the course for JP ports of a game to PC.
1;Monster Hunter World is an amazing addition to the Monster Hunter franchise. The gameplay is solid and provides 100s of hours of entertainment. Plenty to do with the current release once you get through the story and with free updates planned for the next several months it will keep on giving.
1;It's monster hunter... if you like monster hunter you'll like this. I've got a pretty good PC and haven't done a lot of multiplayer so I've avoided a lot of the launch issues which probably helps my opinion. The only weird issue I've run into so far is occasional crashes when alt tabbing. For everyone else it'll be really great if the port is cleaned up.Edit I've done a fair amount of random multiplayer now and have had fairly few disconnects when joining hunts.
1;I can easily recommend this game absoultely love Monster Hunter sure it has a few game play designes that make Multiplayer a bit of a pain if you ain't used to it with the story cut scenes and there has been a few connection issues in its first few days but other than that its a good port of the Console version runs super well for me at least I'd put nearly 28 hours into this game by the time it had beeen out about 35 hours.... so that goes to show how much I've been enjoying it again.
1;Been playing since release here's my thoughts If you do not own any other platforms to play this game then buy it it's an amazing experience it has so much depth and things to master all the different weapon types feel unique. The issues are kinda annoying but not a deal breaker to me and don't really detract from the experience. But if you have other consoles to buy the game for just play on them right now they are the superior ecperience.
1;I love the game and have been waiting since release but the network issues are game breaking for me as I play a lot with friends. They patched a fix but I highly doubt that it fixed the issue as I still get disconnected a lot. A lot of textures in this game is also ugly.Gameplay wise it is really good.EDIT Since the recent updates I no longer encounter the network issues. I don't remember getting disconnected at all anymore.
1;Update The game has been updated and I've not had any disconects since then. So I don't really have anything significantly negative to say anymore.Update 2 The content updates really don't feel like they're coming out quick enough at all.300 hours on xbox nearly another 100 here and I still feel like there's a lot more mileage in this one.Make sure you're PC is powerful enough I have a 4970k and a 970 and it runs decent(ish).
1;Monster Hunter World is an amazing game on PC. It seems to be repetitive but it is repetitive with quality. Game itself will attract you with tons of item you have to harvest and intelligent AI that you cannot predict their behavior. I would recommend this game if your computer spec can reach the point. Playing with friends is main event for this game but it is also possible to hunt alone.
1;This game is the best Monster Hunter I've played. If you are a fan... You should get it. I have had Zero connection issues (preordered) and My friend and I have always been able to get into games together. Ive done all the quest and now I am just grinding for the gear and decorations I want while waiting for new content. Took me about 60 hrs to beat the game game and 100 hours to complete all quest (I ran a bunch of different quests which added to the time but I am not complaining about it).
1;It's a lot of fun I highly recommend it. Be aware that the CPU requirements are fairly intensive I actually purchased it without checking and as a result was unable to play wiothout upgrading my computer. If you've got the PC specs it runs like a dream and looks beautiful. The gameplay get s a bit grindy after a while but hunting everything once is a worthy enough goal to keep you going for a long time.Highly recommend trying co op with a friend.
1;It's one of the few titles that reward player for time contributed. Amazing ecosystem so random interactions between players and mobs and what's the most important lot of fun if you at least a little bit curious. I encurage all gamers to buy it as it's just ripped from salt and negative attitude of players known from other multiplayer games. Amazing graphics leaves you amazed by world panorama scenes. However this all is connected with cost of a good computer. But still worth.
1;"""On the main review page? You see that thing on the left how many reviews does it say I have. Jack squat right? I never review because I never often have something to say of importance. This is the exception.""""PLAY MONSTER HUNTER WORLD! If you are new to the franchise this is where you start. If you are a veteren from older games me this is where our community grows.""""That is all."""
1;Amazing game beautiful graphics and great gameplay. Playing with friends is even better with the Monster Shenanigans. I haven't witnessed many bugs and I would gladly play full price for this game. The Coral area is absolutely beautiful as well. Can't wait for Pickle Joe to deathbeam his way over to the New World.
1;ok so im going to make this quick.... This game is awesome. Ive played MHFU Mhp3rd and MH3U and this is by far my favorite.. Everyone who leaves reviews is just a salty sunflower. There is a reason this is the 4th most played game on steam right now!!! )
1;I played monster hunter since the first monster hunter and this game is so much easier compared to previous gamesAlso there is not many new monster the rest is just converted from the previous gameBut evenso i still like monster hunter can be played on PC and you can create meme character
1;Worth the wait! Not sure why so many people have had issues with the game but I seem to run it fine. Currently running a i5 7600k with a GTX 1060GB. Seems to work fine. Multiplayer is so much fun too!**Update****AS OF 9/11/2018 I have not had ANY connection issues whatsoever****9/19 noticed connection issues when I'm in game and press the windows key or tab out of the game it will occasionally disconnect (so long as I dont tab out often or at all game seems to stay stable.**
1;As of September 20th patch I think this game is finally worth buying at full price. Raw input more consistent FPS (looking at you Teostra) and functional multiplayer has the game working mostly as intended.Original You took 7 months to get this right? Really Capcom? Unless you're a die hard fan of Monster Hunter this isn't worth your money. At least not until they fix the broken multiplayer lack of raw input and otherwise terrible controls. An amazing game with a terrible port as it stands now.
1;Graphic 10/10Gameplay 10/10Multiplayer still sucks keep dc but doesn't really matter just need to wait them to fix itThis game is not for everyone because the grinding and the mechanism makes the game quite hard if you don't know what this game is...But overall it's good and brings back memories...EDIT The connection patched already and it fixed... Great game...
1;Now that the servers are fixed I feel like a real human being again! I'm definitely not just saying this so that Capcom doesn't rip the game from my grimey lil gamer hands! P.S. Where is the aggressive pickle Capcom? I know you have him stored somewhere in the back...
1;MHW is a great game. Yes it has a server problem that is being worked on and it's not as bad as people would have you think you might the boot once ever 5 hours and it's not that big a deal just go to the next one. This is my case with the game some people might have more DCs.
1;I love the game I love the Monster Hunter series but how long does it take to fix your server/connection issues? The First few days I was alright with it but the fact its still happening now is ridiculous. I can't reccomend a product that doesn't work as intended at full price.UPDATEEver since the first patch connection has been much better it's more diffcult to find people to play with but at least it's stable and playble. If you want to play with friends it should work well now.

1;Haven't dc mid fight in some time is been like 2 weeks now. The only time I have is only when I tab out on fallscreen. I recamend borderless window mode and having fun. xDOnly problem I have with the game is that monsters clip in things a lot. But thats not something you don't see in games these days.Performance 8/10Graphics 9/10Sound 7/10Gamplay 9/10Cats 100/10(Was updated on the 18 September 2018)
1;Pros Very good PC port Game is kept fresh with regular updates Issues that were present at release have nearly all been fixed Good controller support Massive amount of content after story is completed Many different types of weapons available so you can find which weapons suits your playstyleSo many more good things about this game i could listCons Besides server issues that were present after release the only con I found is the decoration farming post game very long grind
1;"""Its a great one of a kind """"boss"""" fighting game but is weighed down by being a quite below average port. But seeing as how high quality each of the monsters are and the amount of content present in the game combined with more bosses and gear post launch for free I cant help but reccomend it.However If you're thinking about buying it I highly reccomend using a controller the game and the controlles feels a lot smoother with it."""
1;So this game has been out for a few weeks and I've already logged nearly 100 hours if that doesn't say enough I don't know what will. Gameplay is smooth and QoL improvements over previous series entries are immense. Initially I had connection errors but the recent patch has really helped and I'm sure it'll improve more in the future being their first PC port. A solid first entry in the PC realm for Monster Hunter.
1;This is easily one of my favorite games from this year. If you can look past the network issues every so often its a amazing game. It's finally a monster hunter where it doesn't look like a ps2 game. ScottFalco did a amazing video covering this game and i reccomend you watching it if you're intrested in buying mhw.
1;Never really do reviews but this game is worth putting one out for. The mixed is mostly due to the connection issues on release this is fixed now personally I have had no problems at all since release. So all in all brilliant game good times great with friends and great solo.
1;Game is amazing it's Monster Hunter afterall! Treat yourself you won't get this kind of experience in any other game.Negative reviews are mostly butthurt don't make them change your mind theyre just minor issues that are bound to be fixed soon after release.
1;The best Monster Hunter game of all time. Perfect for beginners in the series. Despite the early network issues they are all fixed by now (at least to me and my friends). Hundreds of hours worth of content. Must buy and extremely cheap on steam (compared to console).
1;Im a regular gamer ... i play alot of moba's final fantasy's etc. this game has alotta mixed reviews and i believe its because gaming these days is expected to be .... easy. This game is NOT easy. This game chalenges you and who ever u play with. it's for lack of a better word challenging and refreshing.I give this game a 5 star rating because its beautiful challenging and if u push through the the uncomfortable beginning game and get used to things one oif the best games ive ever played.
1;this game is definitely one of a kind! if you have played monster hunter series before this one is for me the best. It has some new things that make hunting monster more fun. I am already 50 hours plus into this game yet I'm still enjoying this game wanting some more.
1;As someone who had 400+ hours on PS4 I def reccomend this game.Ppl who are worried about the connection issue there is a temp fix and its steam fault why the dcs happen so ofen not the games fault so no need to blame the game for it and they are working on a fix cuz steam wont fix it.11/10 would sink anouther 400+ hours ezy
1;I am having a great time in MHW it runs better than all of the pc ports ive played so far the connection issues only appear to occur at a random time but it get consistent connect at 1 point. Also i blame valve for disconnections in multiplayer (If MHW is P2P)
1;this port crash after crash after crash on top of all the grind for deco at end game now you also have to deal with loosing your rewards cause the game keeps crashinggggg.they seem to have fixed the crashing problems since SOS are a lot more stables now.
1;11/10Playing on a toaster with 15 25 FPS and enjoying the hell out of it. Never played a Monster Hunter game before but it is everything I hoped for.Fight increasingly stronger and more complex monster until you come across one you can't beat improve your self your gear your prep and try again until you push through or go for easier hunts for a while and then return.
1;First Monster Hunter since the mission on MGS Peace Walker and I love it.Disconnect from the online servers from time to time even if the game say you are online your session is unaccessible and will need you to make a new online session.I would say play with some friends the game is clearly made to play with friends and not strangers.DENUEVO inside this goes to your own moral if you are okay with it or not.
1;The game is a ton of fun but with all the problems it has right now I can't give it a good review.After the newest patch most of the online issues have been fixed there's still some occasional dropped sessions but a lot of games have those.There's still quite a few issues but Capcom has shown that they're going to work on it consider this a neutral review.
1;Review adjusted post fix to online issues.Amazing game. There's not much as entertaining as killing huge monsters with your friends. Combat feels great. If you're playing with m+kb you'll likely have to adjust a few controls but it's decent. Getting trough the story is just a beginning the end game grind is real.
1;I dont think I have words to describe what could be one of the best game I've played in years. This game is top in Singleplayer content replayability and ability to make you lose track of time when playing. Granted the game has several issues such as the famous connectivity problems and other bugs affecting gameplay experience. What I will say is that these problems will most likely be fixed sooner or later and 95% of the game is accessible regardless of them.
1;A very detailed game with beautiful effects I think capcom did a good job on this game sure there are some bugs but not many and capcom addresses any known bugs to the public and notifies when a fix is coming. In my opinion I think they handled this game very well and recommend anyone to give it a try.
1;10 30x better load times than the console versions. Performance is fine as long as you can accept not running on ultra if your rig is older. Don't listen to the negative reveiws the only issues the game has are a few minor bugs and the expected launch server issues.
1;Product received for free. Communication ERORR 83 MW1 !.. if your connection got RTO or become high ping or sometimes you got offline while playing multiplayer but this is at early 1 week after release the game and now i didnt got it again.. Fun game. too much grind hunting and hunting. fun to play with other players or with friends. Epic fight while the monster got duel with the other monster. nice combat and good weapon.i recommend this game.. gg!
1;FIGHT BIG MONSTERS AND WEAR THEIR SKIN LIKE ARMOR TO FIGHT MORE BIG MONSTERS10/10 ING AWESOMEEdit #2Capcom sort of got their together and actually made it possible to play with friends so it's back to being reccomended for me.Game is fantastic best monster hunter to date.
1;Played straight 9 hours from lauch (19 00 PM) to 4 AM. I will skip work tomorrow.Worth it.Edit currently the game have a very important connection issues. This make multiplayer unplayable most of the time (I now go 95% of the time solo). Since this really impact the game experience at the moment you should not buy this and suffer.2nd edit after the patch the multiplayer work really well. I have played about 10 20 quests with no disconnect problem so far.
1;I would say so far this game is worth buying especially when you have friends to play with it makes the game more enjoyable. It only has some minor connection issues and sometimes resolution issues (changing from windows to full screen). But if you are buying it be prepared for tons of challenges )
1;My only complaint is not being able to join a friend's private session from in game. You have to go back to the main menu to join and its really annoying.Other than that the game is absolutely gorgeous and I love it. Just wish they would've brought in some of the dlc for the pc when they finally released it. I'd love to see Gore/Shagaru Magala on here but it probably won't happen.
1;Capcom does not care to solve the problem.Disconnection problems are not resolved.I never end the hunt with my friends.Monster hunter world is a single player game.Status Update My friends stopped playing this game.They were disappointed not to be able to play together.Status Update Connection problems have been resolved to work well.Me and my friends have fun together again.Thanks capcom
1;Good job running well with my old x58 machine w/ 1070ti all time smooth and no glitch or freeze situation while ply in high setting 1080p.The graphic really amazing! Seem connection issue fixed and tested for a few match no more DC!!!Well done Capcom and Steam make this game shine again
1;I haven't played any other monster hunter games before but I'm having a ton of fun here. However it's true that the online multiplayer has a lot of problems with frequent disconnects or failure to join sessions. If that's a sticking point for you consider holding off on your purchase until (hopefully) Capcom fixes the servers.
1;60 FPS at 4K 7700k and 1080ti. Game runs like butter. Turn of Volumetric Lighting to git rid of the ugly haze. Update your graphics drivers for the best performance.Some suggested remaps Sprint/Sheath &gt QBlock &gt ShiftAim &gt Right ClickLip syncing looks like it was done twoard the Japanese language but it's not really a big deal. Mouse acceleration seemed bad in the title screen but after adjusting settings the game runs fine.
1;This game is fun despite the menus being a little unintuitive at first. Connection issues seem to have been resolved. Joining random games is fine...the only time I ever have problems now is when trying to join a friend's online session directly. The easiest workaround for this seems to be connecting directly via SessionID rather than trying to Join Friends Session.
1;This is one of the best game released for pc all year. The devs took their time in making the port and it runs great on my 4 year old laptop. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can buy it. Its story is weak but the gameplay is stronger then ever in this addition to the monster hunter games. This is by far the best monster hunter to date.
1;I'm MHW fan. i been wait since PSP.This game is definitely a very good game. i'm still bough it if it a offline game.But when u said it can play online and turn out can't. that's bad.i invite many of my freind to play. now i feel bad. ( now they fix it. it's alot better.
1;Absolute blast with friends and strangers alike. There were a few connectivity issues at first but Capcom worked dilligently to correct them. Easy for newcomers to pick up but still has plenty of meat for older fans of the series. Give me a moment while I sharpen my bagpipes.
1;I love the game. It's fun when it works. A lot of people are apparently having issues with framerates and crashes. I am one of those people. Settings all put as low as they get still get BAD FPS drops due to CPU (i7 6700) being obliterated. Then the game crashes randomly but I haven't been able to figure out what causes it. Overall I'd say it's worth and I'm gonna keep playing it because it's a lot of fun. Be wary if you think FPS drops and crashes will make your AAA experience unenjoyable.
1;Now that the latest patch mostly reduces the number of disconnects that me and my friends got I definitely recommend this game for the gameplay experience that it offers.Also dear Capcom please bring the DLC monsters and events to the PC version ASAP.
1;The game itself is amazing.Gameplay is smooth monsters are challenging enough and the graphics are great.It's a surprisingly good port with no frame drops and well transfered controls from controller to keyboard+mouse (it does support controllers too).The only problem right now is problematic servers but they appear to be less problematic every day since release.All in all amazing game.
1;Post a new Quest to hunt Anjanath Find Anjanath. You can use Flare now.Me Well time to use flare so my friend can help me to kill Anja Server Not on my watch ! *Disconnect now you will continue to play offline mode can't use flare*But seriously I hope they will fix this frequent disconnect as soon as possible.
1;Fun and addictive game. Well worth its money. People nagging and moaning about fov and mouse input is a good sign that the game itself is excellent. It looks good plays good and most importantly feels good. I really started to enjoy it after i plugged in my trusty 360 controller. Only flaw in my opinion is the slightly awkward multiplayer regarding story missions but its not that big of a deal people make it be. 9/10
1;Let me put it to you this way you're missing out on something great if you haven't played Monster Hunter with your friends. Monster Hunter World is a great game. I've been playing monster hunter since 2009. I've put thousands of hours into the games in the past. So far this monster hunter is an upgrade from the past titles. Tip ReShade. Download it install it. Makes all games look better.
1;mostly enjoyable but needs some optimization connetion stability and quality of life fixed. hope it gets better over time.highly recommended if you like bossfights a lot. just don't expect the combat to be arcade y(like witcher 3). it takes some getting used to.
1;Easy enough said I love this game BUT there is the one issue i have and I am pretty sure i speak for everyone playing this is that we all wish the internet connectivity was fixed. If this issue is resolved this would be my game of the year hands down but because of this online issue I have to knock the score down until they fix it so I give it like a 6.5/10 if fixed then it easily be a 9/10. PLZ whoever is responsible for this fix do it soon its killing off your community.
1;Having tons of fun with this game it's combat is fantastic and extremely statisfying. The only negative I have for this game is that the multiplayer is a hazzle. When you and your friends hunt a monster for the first time you have to go watch a cutscene with the monster alone before you can join eachother.
1;I think you guys should fix the controller problem.Everytime I play MHW I have to restart the game for few times to activate my Xbox console.Plus I do hope u guys can fix the connecttion problem in multiplayer.Keep disconnect even I change my setting in firewall I comfirm that my Internet connection have no problem.Lastly I really hope u guys can fix those issues that I mentioned earlier.Thx.
1;No performance issues on my side but i came across some network issues. Also it seems like the voicechat is broken.Taking that aside the game is great loving the track mechanich (not so much the glowy footprints) and the monster fights in the connected map and the little quality of life improvements.
1;It's really fun and pretty much the game I've wanted to play since January of this year BUT it isn't without issues like mouse acceleration being annoying motion blur and MP being very unstable at the moment.Other than that though the game plays well runs fine for me and looks pretty so no complains here on my end.
1;A game that has consistently been well worth my money but with a few annoying quirks and issues. I don't know if I can recommend this game if you're looking to play through the story in co op only but if you're looking to delve into the meat of the game (the endgame grind) with friends you should be good to go. If this is your kind of game the amount of value and content it delivers is insane easily over 100 hours
1;It's great. The best Monster Hunter game ever made is now on PC. Yeah it requires a recent CPU from the last 2 years and make sure your graphics card drivers are updated but it really is an amazing game. Played for 12 hours straight on release day don't ask me how it's just that good
1;A few fps drop in first area and area 14 on first map (I assume it's heavier on those specific part).Other than that the game run smoothly on my pc (Win10 1060 6GB 6700K 16GB RAM).Satisfying kill for the big monsters Edit 2 Multiplayer seems to be fixed with recent patch.
1;This game is godly in its gameplay. However people who have low end computers (such as myself) really suffer with the frames at 30fps on 720p. Besides that theres also the problem of connections being lost at a certain time of day where the servers have gone to Wouldn't recommend this game right now while theres still those game breaking issues but if things get under control this can easily be GOTY worthy.
1;Monster Hunter finally gets its debut on PC and is simply delightful. Originally released on the PS4 the port functions entirely as expected. This review is 3 days after release and sometimes there are issues with staying connected to the online services but there was the exact same issues on the PS4 launch that was resolved early with a patch.Now if you'll excuse me I have monsters to hunt and new gear to craft.
1;My experience with this AGAIN! is that its beautiful amazing and so nostalgic! I really wish they had the OG theme song I would def recommend this to anyone new to the series. Hands down an easy game to come into. Its not like it use top be I can assure you that! G rank I hope it comes out soon! or another version with G rank monsters!
1;This port definitely has lots of problems that need to be ironed out including frequent connection issues.That said as someone who has not played a monster hunter game before I find the core gameplay very fun even solo and thoroughly enjoy the variety of weapons in particular. Still worth it even in spite of the problems in my opinion.Besides if Nier Automata can get a pass for it's port this game should too.
1;a great game to play but sadly the multiplayer problem that is making the player frustrated. As MH is a fun game to play with friend together. hope capcom or valce can solve the server disconnection issue soon and will not recommend until the new patching is done for the multiplayer problem.new patching is done to solve the DC issue.
1;The game content immersiveness is awesome. BUY NOW!!I have an i7 4790k overclocked to 4.8ghz and GTX 1080 with 16GB RAM and am only getting around 60 80 FPS on 2560x1440 with the Highest settings and Volume Rendering Quality turned off.My partner has an i5 6500 (stock) AMD R9 390 8GB RAM and getting around 50 60FPS on 1080p High settings with Volume Rendering Quality.
1;at the end of the day it's monster hunter. if you're a vet you should have a good time. I haven't had many connection issues and i'm enjoying the loot grind. running it at 4k 45 60 ish fps looks great and i don't mind the frame drops all that much but hey that's just me. if you have a 3ds or a switch buy those monster hunter games they're better in my book but if your looking for a monster hunter game on pc that isn't in nintendo speak this is a good pick.
1;This is the first Monster Hunter I have actually played past five minutes. As soon as I heard Monster Hunter was being released on PC it immediately drew my attention. I can honestly say that it is such a rewarding and action packed game. The combat is beautiful the creatures are challenging and the world is so vibrant. You can tell a lot of time effort and love went into the creation of this game. Wholeheartedly recommend. Will continue to support the brand for years to come.
1;OLD It's just frustrating playing something you love that won t work when it's at it's best... UPDATE Even tho the patch was small I've had very few DC's in quite a few hunts. Still having some errors with creating rooms but so far so good. Lets just say that when the connection is good enough to start running into trolls we on the right path.
1;Honestly this game is great. Really really great but pls Cupcom fix your godforsaken servers. If I see another (insert yours favourite numbers) MW1 I'm gonna tear my eyes out.And I hate that on steam there is no option to give something else than positive or negative review. Because seriously Because of server issues I'd love to give this game pretty fair 50%. But I cant and this suck.
1;In my previous review I gave this game a thumb down because I can't play co op with my friends after got so many network error. With this new patch I rarely got network error again when playing co op. I hope the developer continue to improve this game. Thank you for listening to MWH PC players CAPCOM!
1;pros u get to make a cute cat and then as u progress u get better armor for ur cat and even get to face ancient creatures known as elder kittenscons the game sometimes disconnects from ur team when ur playing with other cats (rarely happens to me average 1 in 10 occurences)very well recommended
1;Always been a fan of Monster Hunter games but stopped playing when it got ported to Nintendo now that its back to PC i had lots of fun playing/grinding through the game. Only problem that i encountered was the servers constantly getting me disconnected but still kudos to the devs hoping for more updates/events soon
1;Amazing game been a fan of the series since childhood when Tri came out on Wii and me and my brother rushed to the next town over to buy it on release day after watching the advert for it every time it was on TV for months. None of that was important aside from perhaps highlighting a bias anyway I'd say World is just a beautiful game and a great addiction to the franchise.
1;Multiplayer errors are rare now and no crashes or any save file corruptions in my part. Game is enjoyable but I know someone whose save file got corrupted after a power outage. Give the game some time it will sort out most issues. Great experience with the game so far. MHW is a 9/10 for me.
1;"""Game is taxing and you need a """"powerful"""" pc to play at 60 fps and even then you might experience fps drops when attacking monsters or when big effects happen but that's kinda to be expected.But that's a small inconveniance compared to the fun and thrill of this game.11/10 Palicos"""
1;To briefly summarize what people were saying on the discussion page yesterday NO PRELOAD! DENUVO! MOUSE ACCELERATION!!! SCREW THIS GAME IT'S GONNA GET REVIEW BOMBED!!!11!!!!1111!!!1111!!In other words this is the best PC game since The Witcher 3 and Dark Souls 3 and has surpassed both in terms of launch sales and number of concurrent players at launch.
1;So many diconnects from multiplayer it really takes the fun out of it. Bought this game to play multiplayer and it just keeps disconnecting. And it's definitely not my internet. I've played heaps of multiplayer online games with no issues and you get so many disconnects on a daily basis on MHW. Considering how much this game costs you would expect simple things like this to work.edit Now that they've fixed multiplayer the game is so much more enjoyable!
1;I love this game. It is as fun as I hoped it would be and feels the best of any Monster Hunter game i've played. If you are a newbie or a seasoned veteran this is a fun experience that you should try. Whats even better is you don't have to buy an entirely new console to play it.
1;Love the game played solo through PS4 version then got the PC version to enjoy the game with friends.There's still a few issues (FPS particle lag textures) but overall the game's enjoyable.*Updated to positive as connection issues are now mainly fixed.
1;Game is by far one of the best ive played have a 1050ti i5 3450 (bottlenecked gpu) play the game at max settings 40fps easily could get better but completed the game anyways had a wonderful time playing get a controller controls on kb and m are wonky this game is an absolute blast and i reccomend it to everyone if you like third person combat and killing massive monsters
1;Edit 08.09.2018 After they fixed the Servers finally I was testing it to make sure. But now I can give this game a thumbs up.Old I would really like to recommend this game but I can't right now due to the issues with the servers mostly kno*Error continuing in offline mode*Oh sorry where was I? Anyway like i said curren*Error continuing in offline mode*Sigh by now you should underrstand what I me*Error continuing in offline mode*Apart from that when they work it's fun.
1;This game is great. To fix the problem finding an online session via matchmaker don't use it. Search for an online session and pick one that has lots of people. Not sure how it works with inviting friends because I haven't been able to test it. Hopefully this helps.
1;Dear Sir or Madam I've been avoiding this on PS4 in favor of buying it for PeeCee Mustard Raisins.I like monster map make weapon catDislike ouch owieee ooftoo short didn't read sometimes it can be frustrating and it doesn't forgive mistakes but the camera works much better than in the handhelds and everything is prettier more immersive and dynamic. sent from my iPhone
1;If you were a fan of this series get it. Monster Hunter World saw drastic changes comparing to it's predecessors. It's almost like a complete new game even for experienced Hunter like myself.Somewhat bad porting. FPS drop with low settings buggy login status keep notifying Steam friend list about you started the game.
1;"""Extremely fun solo or with friends. Although others mention having extreme technical issues I have epxerienced absolutely none aside from 3 disconnects in my (currently) 51 hours of playtime nowhere near the """"constant"""" disconnects others mention. Highly reccomended."""
1;Personally I very much like the game I've been playing it sense it came out on Xbox. Despite the now and then internet connection disconnecting the game is still as great as it always has been. People can say they don't like it because of the current problems they are having with it but my mind will not be change. It's a great game
1;It's been many years of playing this series on handhelds and then consoles always dreaming for a PC version. Now that it's here I can finally play it the way I prefer. Compared with the XBox version performance is superb extremely quick loading times (on SSD) and easily runs on max settings (i7 6950X GTX 1080). My single negative for now is the lack of ultrawide resolution but due to the large number of complaints I am confident that a fix will come soon.
1;Really hoping they fix the multiplayer problems soon as randomly disconnecting in the middle of a fight with a full squad kinda sucks. At the very least they addressed there is an issue but we're just going to have to wait and see what they do from there. Great single player experience thoughEDIT Server issues seem to be gone
1;The first entry to Monster Hunter on the PC has been exactly the experience I've been craving!As of a few days out from launch there are some server issues if you are looking for a co op experience but the single player stands up as an excellent game on its own.
1;10/10 would buy againif you've never played a monster hunter game and want to start this takes all the previous games of 14 years and goes plus ultra! The best version of the series.only issue currently at launch is connection but its got a constant 10k players plus just on steeam not including the players on ps4 or xbox so theres just not enough servers it will fix it self with time or better servers.Stay safe hunters! and slay on!
1;Game rocks. The battles are a lot of fun and progressively get harder as you move along in the story and eventually the high rank. Beautiful scenery lots of interesting game mechanics and plenty to craft and do. It has a few flaws (connectivity is a problem) but overall it's just an awesome experience.
1;This is the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. The gameplay is great and playing with friends is really fun. The network connection errors suck but I believe those are getting fixed and it's still playable.Edit 8/26/18 They released a patch that seems to have fixed most of the connection issues. Still not 100% perfect but significantly better.
1;"""The game was definitely a terrible port when it was first released hence its low rating. However the developers have provided numerous fixes and updates and """"most"""" of the issues are resolved. One of the things I really enjoy is the updated mouse control. You can actually play this with a keyboard and mouse now without feeling nauseous every 5 minutes. Would definitely recommend this game seeing how the developers are working hard to fix bugs and the future addition of a lot more content."""
1;+Super fun with or without friends+Getting materials for weapons/armor doesn't feel grindy +14 different weapons classes and many different trees/elements for each weapon (I have about 120+ hours on hammer and still not bored of it)+Repeating same monster hunts are still fun and challenging 40 50 average frames for a high end rig (i7 8700k and gtx 1070x2 sli)(1440p/2k resolution ultra)(Extremely unoptimized for 6 8 months porting this game) No SLI support Disconnection issues when alt+tabbing
1;Product received for free. Easy to pick up but very hard to put down. It isn't perfect though World has its own set of annoying things to deal with such as how often monsters transfer areas resulting in longer clear times not being able to see people in sessions outside of the hub and the PC performance optimization. Still I'd be looking forward to what CAPCOM brings to the table in the following months especially the console anniversary.
1;this game is really perfect it will keep u busy with bosses that u notice ur fighting mosnters about hours but people said matchmaking sucks and their right actually its really hard to find someone to join or be joined in ur quest and if they do they dc usually and soloing monsters have no joy at all cause its a coop game other than that its really good game i think they will fix many things in future
1;This is the first time i write a review about a game in steam usually i hate grindy game because it's tedious not fun.this game is grindy as !! but i tell you this is fun as hell. Because it's not just you leveling up your character it's about you leveling up your skill as a player.Grindy yet RewardingChallenging yet OverwhelmingA truly master piece from the far east10/10
1;So I have had zero issues with connectivity or stuttering or crashing. I played this on PS4 also it's crisper cleaner and alltogether a more pleasant experience. I run it 1080p with 55 60fps constant (with a full party smacking a monster) with a GTX 1070 all settings on max except volume rendering which is off as it makes the game look washe dout anyway. I use both MK and Controller depending on the weapon im using. Such a dream to aim a bowgun with the mouse after YEARS of DS aiming.
1;Im a Bard when im bored im a dwarven lancer. Im pretty addicted to this game. Its not for everyone but if you like hunting monsters with a sometimes clanky combat and friends then get this game. It can be a wee bit grindy so keep that in mind. But its a lot of fun with friends beware the Black Diablos though. Hate that thing.
1;This is the first Monster Hunter I have been able to play and fully experience. Excellent game! Would recommend to friends. Very fun solo and in groups. Several different armor and weapon types to experiment and build on. I will buy more Monster Hunter games in the future.
1;Have been having a lot of fun with this game so far the monster designs are interesting and varied the gameplay has depth and is very fun. I personally have not been having the performance problems others have had so nothing to complain about there overall a good dame and a decent port in my experience.
1;i5 8400 GTX 1080 with updated driver 16GB ram zero issues thus far. I turned off volumentric rendering to get colour back into the game and v sync off. Other than that no settings changed. No crashes a few disconnects here and there but nothing substantial and no problems with mouse input.Very happy!
1;Finally my favorite franchise is on PC for the west! The game is a blast to play and I can't wait to get home to play after work.This is all I wanted from a Monster Hunter game since starting on PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom 2. The game has some issues at the moment and while I hope it gets sorted I'm having a lot of fun!I recommend this game to anyone who likes challenge tight combat loot and co op with your friends.
1;Pros Great combat.Great inmersion.Fighting monsters is incredible fun.Awesome graphics.Cons Some issues with multiplayer connection.Story is kind of meh.Extra info You will need to learn how to use your weapon items environment and monster weakness properly. It is a hard game to master but totally worth it.
1;I've played all since MH3. It's fun fluid and it's more actual monster hunting than menus this time around. I can't even go play MHGU now thanks to this. 90% of connection problems have been fixed so far Capcom SEEMS okay with visual mods but it's still kinda up in the air? There's not a lot of weapon model variety and of course the monster pool isn't as big but that's to be expected with an upscale of a series that's used to being on a 240p device.
1;Very fun and accessible for a newcomer to the series (like myself). Capcom seems very responsive to issues with constant updates in their update branch to fix issues. The connection issues continue to improve with each update (haven't had any since the first round).Performs well with few frame drops and those only occurring during heavy fights.
1;Fantastic game completely let down by multiplayer connectivity issues. If you want to play online with friends it is completely unreliable. The game is advertised as online/multiplayer/co op but has severe connectivity issues. On that basis alone I can't recommend it.This will change if the issues are resolved.Edit Multiplayer has been largely fixed. Can now recommend.
1;People are blowing connectivity issues out of proportion. The game launched with server issues which are essentially resolved now. I play for hours every day with my friends and the only time I get disconnected is when I'm AFK for inactivity.The game runs great looks great and is a ton of fun a great first experience in the Monster Hunter franchise for PC players.
1;This game is amazing. It has tons of amazing features and there is at least 100s of hours of gameplay. All the people complaining about server errors it is week one so let them fix it before you start crying unplayable. I have had zero problems playing this game and have already put 50 hours in. Don't listen to all the downers. They are already working on the servers and it isn't as impossible as people make it out.
1;Basically what I've been waiting for in a Monster Hunter game. It fixes all the technical issues I had with the mobile games to this point and having it available for PC is pretty dang awesome. It has it's issues but it's the most fun that I have had all year.Note I don't generally play online to this point I have played 100% solo.
1;This game is great. Don't get swept up in the negative reviews the game is better than they give it credit. Whatever issues the game currently has will likely be fixed as Capcom is noticing and responding to the complaints. I've been having a great time as is. A few disconnect errors here and there but it hasn't even been a week. Give it some time I'm sure we'll see some good patches. Recommended.
1;It's almost everything I've wanted in a Monster Hunter game. They also trimmed down or simplified a lot of the more grindy aspects making for a more fluid game. All the customization is still there just easier to work with an understand. However the biggest thing is the food graphics are amazing. Always makes me hungry.
1;Online connection has been fixed for the most part however alt tabbing can cause you to disconnect. SOS flares are a bit wonky since they only show a few missions where you can join other people even though there are over 200k people online. Overall it has omproved and I expect the other issues to be fixed soon
1;Ok so i got this game because it looked really cool and neat the only things i dont like 1)Connection issues to the multiplayer servers however that can be fixed so it is a solo only thing for now.2) i dont care for the targeting style it is either it jumps from target to target in the area hold down a button or dont use it. other than that i think it would be a solid game to play and i will enjoy it till the issues are fix
1;I have been lucky enough to not run into any issues with this game and so far it's been a blast. Although I haven't been able to play online for there is an issue being resolved on capcom's end. I turned off volume rendering and sit at 60 fps 90% of the time. Everything else is high/max. Running on a gtx 1080 i7 7700k.Basically the game does has technical issues (that I haven't ran into personally) and the game is fun.
1;Playable enough for a diehard monster hunter fan on an amd hd6850 and fx6130 (lowest settings usually 20 30fps).Main issues are disconnecting issues and crashing for some people.But its ing monster hunter so im obligated to drop at least 300 hours in it if not 600+ regardless of the tech issues. The game itself is great and very fun both solo and with friends. No regrets dropping $60 on it even if its barely playable on my rig.Bring back Lagiacrus damn it.
1;This game is great for single player.But for those who seek co op sessions with their friends like me I won't recommend this game until they fix Multiplayer.Edit They already fixed Communication Errors. Not totally fixed but at least it happens less frequent than before. Just to be clear I bought it for its multiplayer feature. That's why I gave it a Negative Feedback.
1;Game is absolutely amazing. Not my favorite in the series but pretty close. Friendly to beginners. My fps does seem to drop when weapons with special effects are used particularly with thunder ammo for some reason but it is manageable. An interesting roster of monsters combined with 14 different weapons each with their own unique play style gives this game tons of content. Highly recommend 9/10
1;Just like the PlayStation version this game quickly took over all my time. It has some server problems but the PlayStation version had the same issues. Taking out Squads and making everything run through steam made it even more complicated to join your friends sessions. I hope they patch squads back in at some point. I love this game and I know I'll end up with 300+ hours on it just as I did with the PlayStation version.
1;Did you ever have the sudden urge to smack prehistoric creatures in the head with oversized weapons made from the carcasses of their brethren? Well look no further.One of the best if not the best iteration of the series. Many great reworks quality of life changes and new additions. Online mode has still a few problems but nothing to keep you from playing.
1;In the past I've played MH in fact I played MH Tri and I became adicted to it if Capcom knows something is how to make fun grinds. MHW is so far a great experience except for 1 thing... connectivity issues Either some people can join the session while others are unable too or you lose connection to your team members in the worst time possible leaving you to fight 1v1 a darn Diablos. Capcom please fix this and your game would be the GoY hands down no questions!
1;Running smooth so far on Ryzen 1600x with RX570x. Multi player have some problems but I moslty hunt alone on lower rank and early high rank means more zeny. This is an easy game compared to MH4U moslty because the tedius stuff were removed but Monster hunting difficulty is moslty the same and balanced.
1;Great game. And absolutely no issues whatsoever except for some quality of life stuff which I would like to see in a PC game. Nothing that can't be added through future patches. The game is perfectly playable. Played online with a friend for 5 hours without any issues. I really don't get all those spoiled brats whining about the small stuff. Don't get intimidated by it unless of course you're one of them as well.
1;"""TLDR Pros It is exactly what you want when you think of a 2018 Monster Hunter game on pcCons regularly disconnects for no obvious reason controls with mouse and keyboard are clunky at times feels like they only spend about 3 days working on porting it to pc instead of over half a yearStill 8/10 would play for 500hrs because its MH but really disappoints in the """"well polished port"""" deparment"""
1;It is just sooo goooodddd!!! I've been waiting for proper Monster Hunter game for PC even had to use emulators before but now the hunt is on!I play mostly solo and there are no issues. Currently there are some major issues with multiplayer connection.
1;It's a good port of an instant classic High runs smooth on my GTX 1060 and low 720p runs smooth on a friend's GTX 950m (below minimum recommended). All menus seem to work fine with a mouse although it is clear that the game was designed with a gamepad in mind which I think is fine as everything works fine.
1;wish it came out for steam in june or may id already have a few hundred hours maybe a thousand or two. Ive seen disconnection problems out the wazzu but my net is bad anyway so i was planning on solo play for most of it until i went back to college. Yeah the disconnects are annoying but on my end they seem to be mostly due to my bad net and not servers. My friends with pretty good net never have a problem.
1;Haven't been this hooked to a game since i played Warframe back in 2014. It is grindy but the game makes the grind fun. Currently there are server issues thatvare being resolved as of now. Like many this is my first monster hunter experience and i highly recomend others joining in.
1;While the optimization of the game can certainly be improved i have found it to be quite a good port. Let hope Capcom fixes the server issues and it would be golden. As for the campaign being solo as everyone seems to think. The one thing you can do is simply have all you friends start the quests and watch the cutscenes. You can the return to town and post the quest now everyone can join. (Or us and SOS for random people to show up).
1;"""Hit It Until It Dies World is a great game.Some things have been streamlined from past entries but that's ok most of the things that people will say have been """"casualized"""" are just quality of life improvements. (Go play your looking game 5 year old XX Ultimate on the switch dudes)All weapons are viable for the first time in the freaking series all the armors are cool.The DLC can't come soon enough."""
1;I've played MH since Tri and the Wii and World is another great game in the series. A ton of QOL improvements pair well with the hi res graphics and open world. THe game has a slighy smaller roster than I would like but Capcom appears to be supporting the game quiet well based on the PS4 event quests I've heard about. Online play issues are a minor inconvinience but the game can be played solo and doing so is the best way to learn new weapons or get better at fighting monsters.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter game and I've been having tons of fun. There's a disturbing lack of MMOs right now and MHW has given me the grind that I've been longing for. I'm about 90 hours in at the point of writing this review. I have enjoyed playing both single and multiplayer. The multiplayer issues unfortunately affect me everyday I have to remake sessions or restart the game to enjoy it with my friends.
1;The game is an absolute blast but waiting until early launch bugs have been worked out to an extent might be called for. It's not enough to ruin my time in the game since most issues are simply intermittent and the game works properly after a bit of waiting but they are clearly very annoying to some players. The only issue I've had that I can't understand is a recent issue that causes my cutscene dialogue to slowly go out of sync to a quite large extent but hopefully that's fixed soon.
1;game is good... i have almost 1000 hours on ps4 and my only issue was with being able to data transfer to pc.. i realized that pc release wont have the updated content that the consoles have gotten over the months so data transfer may be a little tricky.. just wish i could have continued where i stopped on ps4 on pc.. i read that transfer is alllowed with other MH games
1;Negative Reviews Conection Issues (True but Sp doesnt need it)Hard gameNo 32k Resolution with Ultra MEGA Wide Screen (no one need)Bad Mouse and Keyboard port (I cant say this. Played 50h now with m/k and it works fine yeah you have to change a few bindings but tell me a game where all Setings are made for everyone)All in all They have to fix conections and its a perfect game 10/10
1;I fell in love with the Monster Hunter series with MH Generations on the Nintendo 3DS. I waited patiently to be able to play on PC with my friends and I wasn't disappointed.The game is fantastic. Hunting monsters is just plain FUN. Yes there are some bugs and server instability issues around the launch but that doesn't make the game bad. Look past the people who are so quick to just rate this as a bad game because they had minor issues on day 1.
1;Requires you to tweak the settings for keyboard/mouse default settings suck.. google some guides for this and this game is great.. has connection issues with steam which thay are working on.. these 2 factos are the main reason for the negative reviews. start with increase mouse turn speed in camera settings to 58 62.. otherwise this game will feel broken its on 50 by default.. AWEFULL default setting that is breaking this game's reviews
1;I'm really worried that capcom'll never put another monster hunter game on PC with this reception. Deserved maybe for the broken online. However I can say that my old junky PC is about five years old and has no trouble powering through this game. The game itself is a blast with buttery smooth controls and fluid combat but uh that's what you get when you play Monster Hunter.
1;"""First of all I bought this game for ps4 and pc. So I have put quite some effort in playing this game. It's a really good game as long as you play it with a controller. The only issue with the pc version is that there are """"some"""" connection issues when playing online."""
1;Look the servers are generally ok there are issues from time to time yes but nothing that hasn't stopped me from playing with friends for excessively.Long and short server issues exist but they are going to get fixed eventually the base game is a strong Monster Hunter game and is fun throughout.
1;I've played a lot of hours of this on PS4 and was happy to see that the experience was just as good on PC. I haven't had any trouble with network issues and I'm getting a good framerate even at max graphical settings. I absolutely recommend this game!
1;I'm a long time vet of the series and have enjoyed every moment of it. If you were afraid of getting into the series after rumors of the diffculty of the game know this While it is challenging the game teaches you. You will learn to study your target and remember the moves. After that you will excel. This is one of the most newcomer friendly entries to the series on top of being one of the most beautiful games out there.
1;I love Monster Hunter and World is definitely one of my favorites in the series. Capcom needs to fix the issues with multiplayer and improve the UI for joining games with friends. Great graphics &amp sound design. The game environments are quite beautiful. If you're scared of the negative reviews wait until Capcom releases the first couple patches. We need to show some PC love we're lucky to be given a shot
1;I love the gameplay and atmoshphere only downside is server issues at launch. feels stupid having to spend 5 minutes to get a nicely populated lobby.This game has so much replay value every weapon feels and acts so differently. it truly takes alot of time to master this game.
1;42 hours. Playing solo has no problems so far. Haven't tried multiplayer (except LAN). Trying it with my brother in the next room did not disconnect us or had any errors at all while connected. In short if you're a solo player it's great. If you're looking for coop and your buddies live faraway you might as well stick with consoles.
1;Okay so this port is getting a lot of flack right now. I just wanna say the mouse and keyboard controls feel fine after just an hour playing with them there's even an option to change the analogue item wheel to hotkeys. The multiplayer is complicated overly complicated to get right but once you learn it you've learnt it so you know chill.It's a fun fun funfunfun game and if you can only get it on pc get it. But maybe check if your graphics card has any problems with running it. B) Xx
1;A lot of people are upset about the network issues and yes its very annoying but this is the first monster hunter title ive ever played and I have to say as far as the game itself goes it is amazing. It is a breath of fresh air for the current gaming scene. If you can get past the network drops which is frequent. You will have an amazing time with this game.
1;"""Very fun. If you liked previous Monster Hunter games you'll enjoy this. Lots of qaultiy of life changes from past games. Also I got used to the """"janky"""" mouse controls in literally one match so it's not as big of a deal as some people have made it out to be."""
1;Definitly the superior version compared to PS or XBox. Loading times are a blessing and a constants framerate makes it all the more enjoyable.To improve FPS set shadows and Volume Rendering to low the difference in visuals is neglectable but the additional frames really help out to stabilize the framerate and keeping the game easy on your rig.
1;Got hooked on the game and got 30 h in 2 3 days. I recommend getting this game if you want some good Sologame because the multiplayer is bugged since a few months even on PS and Xbox. Kicks you out of online sessions with friends and puts you in offline mode /
1;I bought this game when it first came out for console. I do not regret buying the it again The game is fun game to get into but not for everyone. Unfortunately there are problems with connection issues and the Denuvo DRM situation. Hopefully these problems will be fixed becuase there is a big community for this series and many of them would love for Capcom to continue releasing games on PC.
1;The game had its many disconnection issues around the launch release but now it's pretty much perfect. This game can be played alone or with 3 other players. Take on an adventure together or get carried by the one friend who's super overpowered and has already won the game.Tell your friend to be nice and grab some gear at your own level and grab the real experience.After beating the game it felt pretty dead to me. Bam. But there will be more monsters and challenges later xd
1;Not a bad port but there are still a few bugs that should be addressed especially for a premium game. Communication errors are very hit and miss one minute you're with a full party hunting diablos the next minute you're solo. On launch theres a resize issue that can sometimes occur. However on the positive side the gameplay and graphics are really well done the lock on target system isn't great but other than that it's super fun.
1;Fantastic game the peformance could be better but with a Ryzen 2700x Gigabyte 1080ti 32 GB DDR4 3000 Mhz and the game installed on an SSD it runs quite well. The game is incredibly fun and well worth trying if you have a computer that can handle it. Hopefully they improve the performance in the futur
1;Love this game been waiting over 5 years before they even enounced it was coming to PC. My only complaint is the controlls. I also play on a Laptop so I can't use both LMB + RMB would love to see a hot key for both bottons in the combat config. Runs pretty well 98% of the time. I can't wait for this to be recognized as one of the best games on PC. Awesome job Capcom really made me wait for this game a very long time
1;Great game the gameplay takes some time to get used to but once you do it's a blast. The optimization isn't great though probably the only problem with this game it's not as bad as Ubisoft's garbage optimizations but still with the time it took them to port the game to PC I was expecting a bit more.It's a really good game though def worth a buy even when not on sale.
1;I run a 940mx with 2GB Vram on a laptop and this game is able to performance consistently above 30 fps at very low setting.Game still look nice at low setting.Fun with friends.Game is great overall with some annoyances 1. Can't skip cutscenes2. Lip sync is off sometime3. Can't turn off motion blur4. The side character The Handler will annoy you within mintues because she keep repeating the same quote like every 10 secondsDefinitely recommend trying
1;The game is great. It's smooth and the while there are some QoL things to work out such as the connection error messages I can't really complain about much.It's a fun game. The kinks will get worked out and after several hundred hours on MHW for the PS4 I'm glad to be able to play it on PC.
1;Ran into all the bugs Bad TexturesLots of micro stutters and general bad performanceHuge mouse input lagGeneral goofy console interface (radial interface instead of just having a 1 10 hotkey bar)Crash to desktop in middle of hunts losing all progressDenuvo using lots of cpu cyclesConnection errors on hunt completionAnd now 100 hours later they either fixed the bugs or mods are available to fix it for them. Great game!
1;Do you like Dinosaurs? Do you like giant weapons? Do you like deep skill based action combat with 14 drastically different playstyles? Most fun I've had since my winter vacation learning Rocket League. When the multiplayer is more stable this is a serious 9+/10 game.
1;Game is all good but the connection is terrible. Every time I did a mission with my friends the connection lost somehow. I'm 100% sure my network setting is fine because all of my friends have this connection problem as well. Wish this problem will be fixed soon.
1;Awesome game some stuff is not yet working as it should be but these things can get fixed in the near future.Game looks wonderful HD texture for armor and stuff would be awesome and a welcoming sight for the near future.Shame it's getting a mixed review for things that can be fixed C
1;Played Monster hunter ever since the 3GS and have been waiting for it to be on PC. Now that it is finally here it is a great game just like I remembered WHEN IT WORKS.The game is overall really well made and it is enjoyable when the online party doesn t disconnect EVERY GOD DAM TIME. I would recommend this product but wait till they fix the disconnection issues. Because it is really annoying when you are having fun destroying a monster and all sudden hit in the face with a error code.
1;Been playing almost nonstop and love this game so far. 0 issues on pc...runs butter smooth. Mouse and keyboard with a couple of key rebinds work fantastic. Multiplayer seems a bit wonky but works well enough to get by....could be improved though. Overall best game I played in a long while....I cant believe the reviews for it are mixed.
1;I have 60+ hrs on PS4 and the port is great. the only issue i've been running into is disconnected from a session with friends during a quest. The disconnects are not game breaking and given how Capcom handled things on PS4 im sure the connection issues will be fixed in no time. love the game and i highly recommend
1;Man o man! I waited for this game for such a long time and the hype was worth it. I have only done the tutorial in about 5 mins but spent the other 2 hrs and 55 mins tweaking my Steam Controller and also spend a fraction of the time making my character.Apart from the rough start the game is worth every penny! Oh and I will continue to update my review as I play.
1;Love the game. Extremely fun fights and rewarding combat. Very fun to play with friends. There certainly are some issues with graphics settings not working proper fps drops in certain areas connections issues etc. However they don't detract from the game experience enough for me to really complain. Things will be corrected over time and the game will continue to get better.
1;Great game silky smooth gameplay rewarding difficulty curve. Never had many connection issues with my group of friends or responding to SOS but hopefully todays patch fixes that for everyone else.Headed to 100 hrs on HBG and loving mouse and keyboard for it.May switch to controller for melee but time will tell.Long time MH fan looking forward to this game growing every new monster in the stable is a win for me. Just want a Nargacuga/ Tigrex to show up D
1;Its a great game. Yea the servers are but thats on steams end not the game. Wish there was better input for controls but at the same time i shouldnt expect to swing my switch axe and respond as fast as i would with dual blades. Also if theres a wishlist let my friends gift me materials or gear that i need for those items please
1;It was good but still have alot of poblems mostly on connection usually while playing you will get disconnected allmost all of the time and sometimes the steam cloud sync doesn't sync properly and eded up losing your progress for now i would recommend this game if you would bought it to play solo not for multiplayer yet
1;"""you like darksouls series?but easier one?dodge all you like?and you want to kill some badass monsters?go ahead get this things.theres a problem while we playing co'op with my friend """"A Random Disconnect Time"""" wich mean i cant help my noob ehm i mean poor friend who cant even fight pukei pukei alone."""
1;great game but the PC port is unoptimized and the network issues are frustrating to deal with especially when you're gonna play with a friend or while on a quest it just kicks you on online and you can't reconnect but i'll still recommend this just because it's still a great game even with you just solo
1;While not the greatest port it's still better than the console versions. Much faster load times. Higher framerate at higher resolution. Ability to use kb+m if that's your jam. Sure the servers are finicky and the game could be better optimized but that's hardly a reason to not recommend it. It's still a good game.
1;"""Despite all the """"problems"""" this game is hella fun. You get used to how the multiplayer works after a few plays its not the best but its not game breaking. It's been 3 days since release and I'm sitting at 46 hours worth every painful minute of dieing over and over."""
1;"""Review comming soon...It is a great game I enjoy playing it.This is just for those who are unsecure You can't play this on hardware from 4 5years ago. Otherwise with a bit of tweaking and updating your drivers (plz do that first!!) it will run great.Also this game needs time to get used to. You won't get used to it in just 1 2h. But after some 4 5h you will get this great feeling after slaying the monster that had been sabotaging you for """"days""""."""
1;The Monster Hunter World PC version is a good port of the PS4 version. At launch you get higher frame rates higher resolution faster load times and the ability to play online for free. Right now the servers are having some trouble so online play is a bit tough at the moment but there is enough solo content to get through that can take a week. This game will be a grind fest so expect that going in.Controls on the PC are playable I'm used to using the PS4 controller which it can support.
1;No idea what is going on here. I've only had like 3 disconnections so far and I can run the game at 4K 60fps with a few tweaked settings. Servers can be fixed and an HD texture pack would be pretty sweet too. The game itself is amazing. I would consider this one of the best games I have ever played. If you don't want to risk the server problems wait for patch to be safe I guess.
1;If you don't like this game I am so sorry.This is the best game I have played in a long time the polish and the beauty and the world they have created will be eating up all my free time for a good long while.This is not only the best MH game ever made this is easily the best game since Witcher 3. (I'm aware they are very different genres.)
1;"""haven't u noticed that CAPCOM is trying to deliver a message through this game?""""U love this game?then buy a PS4.U think PC sucks?so do we""""its still a good game thoughjust fix the connection problemI wanna play with my fat roommatePS After this I still don't think Tencent is reliable.Fxxk WEGMAE"""
1;30 hours in and the only major problem i clearly see is the stability of the online play (if you want to play in a group). For the rest of the complains i see in the reviews myself I am not bothered by the lack of in depth PC options to enjoy a great game!
1;It's been a few years since I last played a Monster Hunter franchise MH3 on 3DS. I remember enjoying every bit of grinding back then and I'm sure I would love it now as well especially with online sessions. The PC port is also pretty decent albeit needing a beefy PC for it run on its best performance. Luckily my 5 year old PC can still run it in medium settings with 40fps. I guess it's time to upgrade haha.
1;Awesome game. The PC port is decent despite some connectivity issues that every AAA title would have on release. This will be fixed in no time.Don't listen to toxic plebs with shi tty 5 7 y.o. PCs.Freaking gtx950 2gb in pair with decent CPU (Pyzen 5 1600) can handle 60fps on medium settings with high on textures.Buy it and have fun with it.
1;This is an absolutley amazing game. As soon as you turn off volametric fog you can run this game on a potato. Currently there is a multiplayer bug but there are work arounds if you can be bothered to look in guides or on the mh reddit. No crashes and buttery smooth 60fps.
1;One of the most enjoyable games i have ever played.The variety of weapon choices and builds available to you is phenomenal and really gives you alot of things to doThe variety of weapon classes really lets you choose your playstyle and i presonally feel like they really differ from each other in their movesets.Great game at the moment has no real technical issues. also i never played any of the other mh games
1;Edit 18.09.18 Game connects fine without any issue now! There are some minor issues with sounds looping when they should not and let's not talk about drop rates xD but it's a 10/10 GREAT game!As of 20.08.18 game still suffer connection issues it's fun when it works but I would not recommend buying it as it is now.
1;Coming from an MH vet this is a bloody horrible PC port but an amazing game. I avoided playing the console versions so I could wait for this and play it with m+kb... yet I'm forced to play with a dualshock anyways because of the absolutely horrid mouse acceleration and the way the camera functions. Recommending despite all the issues because it is still a good Monhun at its core.
1;This game is great don't listen to the bad reviews. The port is sub par and the game has some connection issues at the moment because of the demand but if you are playing solo or can put up with a few minutes of inconvenience every 30 minutes with multiplayer this is a great game.
1;The game itself is really fun! Once you figure out multiplayer it's pretty stable with the occasional disconnects but I didn't think of it as anything game breaking.If you're comfortable with controller have some friends you want to play with (after you figure out multiplayer) have an okay rig then I would gladly recommend this game.
1;Was pretty sceptical buying this game as I have never played a monster hunter title before but it absolutely amazes me. Unbelievably challenging want to break my computer sometimes but there s something in my head that drives me to keep on poaching monsters for no reason. 10/10 would get sexually assaulted by a fluffy pink T Rex again
1;Great game! If you want some challenge to be a full time hunter or a part time you can do it. A hunt takes 20 minutes and it is really fun. If you want to play online go for it. They fixed the connection errors so everything is good now. The game is really fun and challenging. 100% recommended.
1;I would love to play this game but throughout lags are denying me that. My PC is way better than the recommended performance is. CPU Intel i5 6600K GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GBRAM 8GB DDR4When anyone know's how to fix this problem please add me and write me a DM
1;I have a 5 year old PC with what I'm assuming isnt exactly top of the line hardware. I have 8gbs of RAM. The game plays with most of the settings on high looks beautiful and plays smooth. The load times are vastly improved over PS4. I have no complaints. Top notch port as far as I'm concerned.
1;the game constantly causes steam to disconnect the controls on keyboard and mouse are good in my opinion coming from games like BDO.optimization is good on an I7 6700k 4.2Ghz + Nvidia 980Ti 1.3ghz. the game stays a solid 60 at max everything bar volumetric effects.tho i have noticed that when steam disconnects it coincides with a stutter ingame.overall i would still recommend this game. it is has its flaws in places but none are terrible enough for me not to enjoy it.
1;I enjoy this game a lot. The only thing that is upsetting is that I've been disconnected from the last 5 SOS quests i've joined. Fix the dang network issues. A game breaking issue and a fix hasn't been put in place is past ridcoulus. I would recommend it to others only if they fix the network issues.
1;Love this game. it runs beautifully online connectivity hasn't been a problem for me and mine and it's Monster Hunter. It's a game that rewards replay and retrying as you learn how to best contend with the different monsters constantly throwing new mechanics and challenges at players without being a slog.
1;Game is damn good solo but nearly perfect with friends. Launch day and the night after were a little rough with disconnects but so are 100% of highly anticipated online games. So I can't really fault it for that because it is a standard with which the entire industry complies.If you want a lot of game for your money you can't go wrong with Monster Hunter World. Especially if you can talk a friend or two into taking the plunge with you. You won't be sorry.
1;An amazing console release the biggest in the series history has made its way to PC. The port itself is workable with noticable bugs in resolution connectivity and matchmaking. Hopefully an upcoming patch will sort out those issues but don't let it detour you from the best MH title available in the U.S.
1;It's taken 3 weeks but the problems with disconnections seem to have been resolvedJust remember to restart your Steam client every 24 hours.I don't need to say anything else. This is monster hunter if you're a fan? You've already bought this. If you aren't? There's little I can say to change your mind. If you have no idea why all this anime exists? Go and inject it straight into your veins.
1;I just started playing this game and already I've wasted hours of my time on this game due to the game crashing on me.I would be questing and all of a sudden the game would crash! And i lose all my progress!Although the game is fun they better fix the crashing issue or else I can't even get through like 30 minutes into a quest without it crashing on me.
1;Monster hunter is a game that is as large and capable of devouring the player as the many beasts that inhabit the game. The constant drive to go out and kill and hunt will overcome you if you are not strong enough. You will find yourself elbow deep in your 13th carve of the same monster wondering if this is it but then you find the gem you have been digging for and the game makes sense again. Bretty good/10
1;I do recommend this game. AS IT IS NOW today we finally got a patch fixing the mouse controls together with all the fixes alongside during the last 30 or so days the game is NOW in a state it should have been at the launch... This is a fantastic game you will certainly have ALOT of fun with. I just hope that CAPCOM deliver THESE kind of experiences in the future not the buggy mess of a game it was when we got our hands on it.
1;garbage servers with 5028f mw1 disconnections everytime of the day DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED21/8/2018 EDIT they released a 150mb patch claiming to fix the disconnection errors but still cant find a proper session to join in to overall ruining experience still DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED smh cant believe they're ruining a veteran's wet dream over connection issueslate edit they fixed it plz buy the game it's a delight.
1;Every fight is like an MMO raid boss after a fashion. It's clunky or at least difficult for Mouse and Keyboard to start learning controls but once you get into the swing of things you don't really want to get out of them.Definitely recommend playing with others/friends however. It can get stale at some points just listening to the annoying Handler 24/7.
1;Quite a good port but some recommendations Turn off Volume Rendering.Turn off Dynamic Camera.Swap your radial menu to keyboard mode.Tweak the mouse acceleration to your liking.The game itself is very good already put over 500 hours in on the PS4 version.
1;So many people whining about how buggy multiplayer is. Game is absolutely great even though its buggy but those ppl complaining about multiplayer dc's should srsly need to get gud in playing solo. If you're a true monster hunter fan its really not an issue. Weaklings
1;First week its having some issues with connection getting disconnected in multiplayer. that being said I played the entire day today with friends with no issues so its a bit random.Single player there is zero issues what so ever.The game is an easy must buy if you are even considering it just a little you WILL get your moneys worth with this game.its deep super fun. Lots to learn and get better at.Just dive in and don't look back its amazing.
1;It's fun. It's monster hunter on PC which I've been waiting for for years. The PC port pretty bad but is definitely playable with a decent graphics card a controller and if you are playing single player. I'm sure the multiplayer issues will be fixed within a week or two anyways.
1;Made it into 4star and I have to say Im impressed. Will drop a better review later. i7 6th gen16gig ram960mruns at 30fps on med + some settings turned up and some off.Updated moved to a negative review will change once multiplayer is fixed. Really kinda the only point to this game and yall done goofed it up.Updated First real patch and things are actually working now. Review updated to Positive.
1;game is fun especially during multiplayer sessions. unfortunately the multiplayer sometimes doesn't work with random disconnects and such. I find it weird that the server is always down at the same time every single day. it's like capcom is doing a manual reset on their server to clear their cache during busy hourgive it a few weeks till the connection is truly stable if you plan to buy it to play with friendsEDIT connection issue is solved now plus deviljho is out so go nuts
1;Played this game on PS4 loved it now on PC and still love it! Overall haven't had any major issues except for connection issues when questing and frame drops using thunder element weapons. As of this review Capcom are aware of the connection issues and are working with valve to fix it.
1;This game is incredibly good i don't have the problems that some people report besides some crashes after a alt tab.Connectivity is not a problem most of the time after launch it was y but now seems almost 100% of the times working.Overall it's not a bad port but i can see the criticism it's sad that the great game itself is overshadowed by port problems.
1;so far as i have play it has ben an great plesure to play the game runs good the grafix are good lip syinc is an bit bad but its not an english game dub voice acting is good and gameplay is what i payed for but in current state of just released pc its online is barrly functioning to that end il recomend it as an single player but as far as online havent ben able to play with anyone else so its ben an let down in that regard.
1;Performance wise its pretty goodi have an r9 390 8gb I5 4460 15 gb ram overall i can run the game at High with rougly 60 fps due to the high temps my R9 is getting i settled for 1080p Higest Settings on 30 fps and just runs smooth on it at that settings has controller supportbit of advice the game runs like the first time you open so open it up then when at the start screen change your settings then exit out then open it up again that should fix it up
1;Awesome game. I would recommend a controller primarily as it's designed for one and there are some mouse latency issues if you use KBM. There are also some network issues for some players that are being looked into but I haven't encountered any so far and I'm 37 hours in. Highly recommended but you might want to get it for two hours and see if you have problems.
1;Very fun game runs well on my 1060 6gb card with i7 4790k. Have played solo if you're planning on doing a lot of co op maybe wait servers are pretty unstable and have heard a lot of people are having constant disconnects. Feels better on a controller but keyboard mouse is viable. First monster hunter game and I was sucked in all weekend playing it.
1;I've had almost zero problems with multiplayer since launchday dont know what these other players are doing wrongly.Just make friend session and start a quest? Its that simple. If your friends cant see it just make a new session.. takes 1 second anyway.
1;I came back to Monster Hunter series from 10 or so years ago. The game of this version has become more casual and enjoyable for the beginners while there are lots of difficult bosses in the higher stages.I myself am not a good hunter of this game and I quit the series of 10 years ago at the lower stages. But the World is on PC so the graphics are so good and the control ability is much better than PS Portable.
1;I don't know why people are giving a thumbs down it's basically the exact same game as the PS4 version. It is a GREAT game that is very difficult to learn with gorgeous visuals compared to the other Monster Hunter games. Controls will take some time getting used to. When I first started playing I can't even hit stationary targets with the great sword xd but after a while it becomes pretty natural to me
1;Game is great I like it been playing MH games since the first one on ps2 only have missed the Wii ones and I can say this is on the top 3 favorites. Right now the servers are a bit unstable idk if it's on steam or Capcom side but the game is good you'll have lots of fun playing it either solo or multiplayer when it let's you. If you are having frame rate issues check the requirements and check if you have same or better but no one I know so far is having frame rate issues or crashes
1;Best Monster Hunter yet. They clean up a lot of the grind cleaned up a lot of the hit boxes and just improved the general quality of life on the Monster Hunter games in general.Had some issues with connection on day 1 &amp 2 but as of day 3 I haven't had much of any issues.Worth it.
1;MH game on pc.?what more do you want me to say?the game is monster hunter does it look the best? no does it need to? no. does it run perfect? for me it does.is the gameplay fun? yes and there is proof its fun dark souls combat is based on the same principle of dont get hit cause you'll die so dont become greedy and swing your weapon around like a headless chicken cause you gonna die pay attention to your target and run when needed.
1;I had been in love with Monster Hunter since it was on PSP and here is my review on MHW Connection issue (yes alot of people are facing this) Not support 21 9 ratio screen (Pls support this so i can play fullscreen on my 21 9 monitor thanks!!!) Why dont this game have hunter Arts and hunter Styles like they did in MH Genaration?? (Really love this new thing)Other than that the game is amaizing!!
1;According to all known laws of aviation there is no way that a Bazelgeuse should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The Bazelgeuse of course flies anyways. Because Bazelgeuse doesn't care what hunters think is impossible.
1;A vibrant and beautiful game full of humorous interactions with friends and the enviroment combat feels impactful and rewarding yet constantly offers new challenges and adventures to go on fun alone but so much more enjoyable with friends and others I strongly recomend this purchase to anyone who enjoys a game with grindy progression and an ok amount of challenge.
1;ive been waiting for this since they first announced it was coming to pc and i couldn't be happier. This game is AMAZING and i am so happy it works on my laptop. I will be sure to spend hours and hours on this game and i cannot recommend it enough!!!!!
1;So many people are not recommending this game because of the drm. This is a good game but because of the drm the game is keep on crashing for some reason. The game instantly crashes if your CPU doesn't support FMA3 instructions too... WHAT A GREAT PC PORT
1;I'm immediately in love. It's just so good. I'm semi new to the series but I've played a little before but this is a whole new take with brand new mechanics. everything is beautiful and wonderful. EXCEPT!!! The tutorial. Just dredge though it. It sucks it's hand holdy. Then everything past that great. It's a solid port it runs well etc.
1;DOWNVOTE Lack of updates Cosmetic updates onlyThis game is straight up dying. They're lacking good content and have a terrible community. This game is not worth joining into. I quit until they fix their servers and whole game.Update 5/14/18 UPVOTE Servers still crap but developers are at least fixing little by little. Interactive game friendly but can be pretty toxic. 30/70 Friendly/Toxic If you're a fan of doing cool tricks this game surely incorporates all of those.
1;I know that a lot of people are having a lot of issues with network connectivity and bugs. Both game breaking and just irritating. All these are valid and worth your concern. I can say that my personal experience has been nothing but possitive. To be fair I have been playing primarily solo. My system is pretty high end and with that I have seen no frame rate of performance issues at all. Overall it's a suggest from me.
1;Great on pc. Tho lower end rigs will have rough time running game but even maxed out with my rig i get around 50 60 FPS if it drops to 30fps it still looks great to me compared to other games at or near 30fps. I own game on ps4 but no one in the right mind would pay $60 for ps plus then times that by two for two people ($120) nope that s why I bought two pc copies. I think they did a good job on MHW on pc.
1;The Keyboard controlls are suprisingly well thought out.instead of pressing button combinations to go through items like on consoles youz can just scroll your mousewheel or use a hotkey bars. There are a ton of keyboard exclusive options in the controlls menus.Performanc is also good. My processor was middle of the road 8 years ago and it still manages 60 fps.
1;Worth waiting for 9 months.Graphic is smooth details are terrific and they optimized things to be easier for newcomers to the seriesThough I would love if they gonna support 21 9 screen as I just brought Predator X34. Even with black bar on the sides the game still look great.
1;Fantastic game I really enjoy playing it. Managed to make it run decently with my i7 7700k and a GTX770 however I think they should look into the current performance issue to make it an overall better experience for others as there have been a lot of complaints about it.
1;I have bought this game for PS4pro and PC. The PC port is by far so much better than it is on PS4pro. However there are a lot of people complaining that the PC port is not that well done. This is true. There are better PC ports out there and this is not one of them. I will recommend this game though because this version is definitely the superior version out of any of the other versions on the consoles.
1;This game feeds whatever is inside that me that enjoys progression based games. Over 100 hours in so far and not a single crash. I have a strong rig and it runs fantastically. I had some issues staying connected to multiplayer missions early on and it was a bummer but it didn't slow me down any.
1;EDIT After update on 24.8.2018 the connection seems more stable. Still disconnects but acceptable.EDIT cannot complete 1 single online game on 17.8.2018 night. Suspected that server cannot handle happy Friday.This is essentially a good SOLO game. If you are looking for multiplayer hunting it fails. So if you do not care about the Co op/Multiplayer tag of this game it's a recommended.
1;"""Most of the negative reviews are talking about a """"game breaking bug"""" which is entirely because of a need to update a windows codec to view certain videos. I have a total of about 600 hours on ps4 before coming here and assuming they support it the same the game is worth every penny."""
1;The multiplayer is wonky (but i hated its implementation on the consoles too so...) Controls are also wonky but I've adapted (bowgun aiming is V or C... i made it mouse 4 and said whatever lol) Best played with controller probably or you face having to relearn keyboard/mouse because its very atypicalStill a crazy fun game and i have it for ps4 AND pc. love it ( ing hate paying for the priviledge to use my ps4 online so i'd rather have it on pc)
1;Monster Hunter World when it comess to gameplay feels absolutely phenomenal and will not dissapoint in that regard. Connectivity issues do still occur though this can be usually sorted out by reconnecting in the quest menu. Play this game for the gameplay and remember not to tab out at the post final monster cutscene as that does cause issues.Yes/10
1;Beautiful world. Immersive combat system. Epic boss fights its like boss fight every quest you do which makes it even Epic er. Sh*t story line. Cringy acting voice and model animation. The game play is too good for that to matter though.9/10 definitely will buy again.
1;Love this game and being on PC now is perfect for me. My only gripe is they made the camera movements square and not fluid if you move the mouse slowly you can see its based on parallel movements and you cant really make a smooth circle without it feeling like its hitching. alot of people say mouse smoothing and acceleration is on and you cant change it but i just think its the issue that the camera movements are still based on how a controller would function.
1;Great game feels like home in the world of Monster Hunter.Beautiful and engaging just don't expect an RPG since you don't level up and get stats.You kill a monster carve their corpses and use the hide and claws to make better gear.I have an AMD RX480 4GB and an I5 4660 and the game runs without problems 60FPS
1;Guaranteed to make you into a cat lover.All jokes aside I am playing on a mid spec pc and even though I have to adjust my graphics the game still gives you that satisfaction. Sure at first you have to change your keyboard outputs to beat suit your preference and as time goes by you can still do the old combos you would do from previous mh games. I have been playing monster hunter since 2000s from psp to 3ds and this is certainly one of the best monster hunter game yet.
1;This game has vastly improve compared to the buggy initial release.But that does not means it good enough there is a issue with terrible graphics and texture quality while even at the highest graphical settings.Thumps up for the game because it's definitely on the right path.Just focus on the graphics and try to release contents timings to the consoles as close as possible &lt But shouldn't be the main focus untill the core issue of the game is fixed first.
1;Not sure what everyone is complaining about I haven't had any issues.My controller worked on first load with no issues.I can play on highest settings in 4K at 50FPSEverything is working really well I cant complain. This is much more enjoyable to play than the PS4 version which I also have.There was some trouble with getting my friends inside the same session but we figured that out.Ryzen 7 1700x GTX 1080 FE
1;"""TLDR good game got some port kinda issues and capcom underestimated the ammount of attention it would get.Pros its monster hunter good combat good gameplay good for slow burn enjoyment and one off bursts of funCons some graphical setting such as motion blur are unavaible and DRM neither of wich is a major """"dont buy"""" issue imo"""
1;In brief Capcom did for Monster Hunter World what Nintendo did with Breath of the Wild. They took the classic formula and pumped new blood into it which in this case resulted in beautiful graphics awesome new mechanics and a crapload of quality of life changes. My only gripe is the poor optimization but that didn't stop me from having a good time with World overall.
1;Truly a game for marathon enthusiasts at last ported to PC. 9.8/10 IGN and Deviljho of the year. Seriously. Devijho the gretest of pickles has now been added to the PC release which automatically makes this game a sublime experience the very few games could ever possibly achieve.
1;I am loving every aspect of this game from the crafting to the hunt but as a multiplayer focused game there are constant problems with disconnects from lobbies. Should the connections issues get fixed I could recommend this game as of now be ready to be frustrated trying to play with friends or be prepared to do a lot solo.Edit as of 9/10/2018Most connectivity issues have been fixed and playing with friends has not been a problem and I can now recommend this game fully.
1;I'm pretty much a newcomer to Monster Hunter and this game is a lot of fun. I'll be honest it starts off pretty slow for awhile but becomes a lot better once you unlock High Rank and start to learn the systems better and figure out what you need/want to do. I haven't had any connection issues since the patch they released a few weeks ago.
1;First review ever on Steam.I having a blast with the game really fun multiplayer is working for me at least after the last patch and it resolved my fps drops when fighting certain elder dragons which dragged my pc to the floor before.I would recommend 8/10
1;Have played mostly singleplayer and it s been great epic battles with big monsters leading to constant upgrading of gear. Multiplayer has disconnected once for me in quite a few missions together with a friend but I totally understand the frustration of those who have had more problems with this than me.
1;"""Tried on a laptop with a GTX 1070 at 1080p on max and a desktop with a GTX 1080ti at 2K and 4K on max and didn't notice any performance issues. It's a good game and runs/looks better than the PS4 version. Only complaint is the poorly implemented """"wait to watch all cutscenes"""" restriction when trying to play the story co op."""
1;I'll give it a thumbs up when you fix the damn connection issues!!! Trying to play with my husband is a nightmare when he keeps getting disconnected from the session and im left to deal with the now overpowered diablos (with a bow btw) that was meant for multiplayer! Love the game itself though.Update With the patches things have gotten a lot better! No dropping so far and now we can really enjoy hunting together.
1;Apart from the strange buttons used for menus etc. the game is fine. It runs fine on my pc and I didn't have a crash yet. Connection problems were solved once I forwarded the right ports and ran the game in admin mode. steam community only knows black and white these days it seems...
1;It's great to finally get a Monster Hunter game on the PC. Better yet it even has its own modding community. Had a few problems at the start but its already getting better. Certainly excited to see this game continue to grow hopefully to a G Rank version like many other Monster Hunter's before it.
1;Veteran to the series since MH3U. I really enjoy the graphics and the new abilities added to every weapon making them even more unique amongst themselves. I played MHGU when it was released and enjoyed it until I accepted the fact that it just looks like a PS2 game and went back to World. I enjoyed MHW even more after a taste of MHGU and am now in love with the game. Great game to pick up for any newcomers to the series as well. Would recommend!
1;CPU Ryzen 2700xGPU GTX 1070RAM 16GBRESOLUTION 1440pFPS Lock to 60 with volumetric off (helps ALOT for fps)Been playing for a few hours and fps is pretty much staying at 60 with some dips to 57 58 59.The combat is fun the story fine and lots to do on the armour / weapons front. I know some have had issues but it installed and ran fine for me. Although you will need a decent cpu and gpu for anything over 1080p.
1;Don't listen to the people who hate on it this is a great game. the first 5 or so hours are a bit slow but if you get through that this game will open up and become much better. 95% the disconnection issues people have been talking about have been fixed in the past few patches. Overall great game. For new people I reccomend watching a guide on how the weapon you wnat to use works and the basi mechanics of the game.
1;Alright changing review to reflect current state of the game.The game itself was fantastic from day one but it was plagued by horrible connectivity problems for like 3 weeks straight making it unplayable online. Most issues are now gone. And there are still cheaters seen here and there but I haven't had much issue with them.The game can finally be played with friends and have many hundreds of hours left of playability.
1;Decent port miss some options to remove stuff like motion blur and maybe move some elements from the UI.Combat is easier than previous MH and is kees rigid than before only downside is that hitboxes on some monsters are weird.Good game to play with some friends and there is not much competition for this genre of game.
1;This game is great and everything I have been hoping for since I preordered it about a month ago! 10/10 would recommend as a veteran monster hunter player. Hopefully will be more optimized as time goes on but I still would highly recommend this game to anyone who is new or returning to the series!
1;If you thinking no game can stop you from wanking? Try Monster Hunter World. After playing this game i can proudly announce my divorse with my both hands because of Monster Hunter World. Trust me if you are looking for next level or . MHW is the only choice.
1;Great game. New to the franchise but I played this for 250+ hours on PS4 and enjoying starting from scratch on PC. Only complaints are the lack of updates and connectivity fixes present in the console versions not being implemented for PC release and the lack of PS4 controller support (at least for button prompts being in PS4 layout and some of the controls being swapped).
1;I got this game as soon as it launched on steam. It is fun and i enjoy it. However there is one major problem that me and all my friends that play this game encountered. It is server issue. Getting booted from a quest with friend is extremely annoying. I hope there is a future fix.
1;"""Monster Hunter DC""""I don't know who you are but i will find you and i will disconnecting you""""** Finally the newest patch fixed the disconnect problem so from thumbs down into thumbs up now Ty for your hardwork but still alot of bugs you need to fix after this Capcom. Specially that lightning elemental weapon that make frame drops"""
1;I don't like thirdperson games. However this game screamed screw that and shoved a good time down my throat. Now I have played it for 5 hours straight... in one sitting... right before work... now I haven't slept but it was worth it.Side note If you start and are not having fun try switching weapons and trying something. I started out with the duel sword and hated this game but switched to sword shield thingy and fell in love.
1;This game is so great tbh. There're a lot of new gameplay environment to use in the map that so creative. Sadly the connection problem is so annoying and turn a lot of players into negative reviews. But this game still a best hunting action game so far. Just hope they can fix this problem soon or else I will turn to negative one too XD
1;Amazing gameVery in depth and engaging combat with lots of variety.Interesting and challenging monsters unique in their own waysVery well designed armor setsBeautiful and interesting environmentsLoads of fun with friends.Cons very awful storySlow early and mid game
1;EDIT Updates have been coming and I've had a much better experience. Flipping to thumbs up.Only staying negative until the connection issues have been dealt with. I could deal with all the frame dips and technical issues but all that on top of constant disconnects and some very hidden game breaking bugs is just too much. Once these issues are fixed this will go to a thumbs up very fast.
1;this is a farming based game so if you don't like repeating things.. buy something else.The world is amazing full of living creatures and monsters whitch create a large credible ecosistem. The gameplay is very fun 14 types of weapon very different one from another. The story is very very thin but fun and full of epic moments.
1;Rough launch for several people in terms of connectivity issues.Major resource hog make my GPU burn up something fierce. Loading times are fast and the frame rate is steady at least?Mouse and Keyboard feels weird but witht the bowgun I LOVE mouse aiming. Recommend using controller.
1;It's a bit of a shame the servers are throwing a hissy fit right now and thunder element damage effects being bugged (if you suddenly feel your framerate dropping check if there's someone using thunder element weapons. the effect causes framedrops like mad it seems.). Most of the issues'll probably be resolved soon though and we'll be in for one hell of a hunt!
1;Game's pretty damn fun even if the controls take a bit getting used to. Looks lovely and unlocked FPS is nice. Only gripe is the connection issues gripping the game makes it a bit unreliable to play with friends.EDIT CONNECTION ISSUES ALMOST ENTIRELY FIXED. 1 DISCONNECT IN 3 DAYS.
1;I wanna be the very bestLike no one ever wasTo catch them is my real testTo slay them is my causeI will travel across the new worldSearching far and wideTeach monsters to understandThe power that's inside One of the best games. Great graphics Great Gameplay. 9.5/10May the sapphire star light our way
1;Finally a Monster Hunter game on PC! It's everything I wanted and more. Sure sometimes you may experience some connection issues but they're rarer than people would lead you to believe. It is frustrating when your friends are DC'd midway through the fight leaving you to fight a multiplayer scaled monster alone but the game is fun enough that I can ignore it's minor flaws. 8/10
1;Originally bought it for the PS4 and decided that it was worth it enough to buy again on PC to play with friends. Has some connection issues and some other small bugs that a few patches should be able to fix. Other than that still fun just needs a bit of love to solve some week one issues.
1;Optimization could be better for sure. Writing this at launch there are occosional problems with online connectivity as well. Everything else however is pretty great the changes the game brings to the series are welcome and finally having MH on pc is worth the rocky launch. i'm gonna stab some dinosaurs with my cat now
1;Vega 56 Performance!Great game great graphics smooth game play. Only 8hrs in but I can see this lasting several hundred. I have a vega 56 custom water cooled and overclocked and I am getting 70 80fps at 1440p all settings turned to max with the exception of volumetric fog (off) and one click down on shadows. Awesome performance no stuttering or frame dropping. I am also on a 2700X at 103 BCLK (with PBO and all that stuff)
1;They fixed already. able to play co op with my friend which is nice and only got disconnect once or twice a day sad but still great than before.......Before they fix.*It's single player game server down everyday. they should put only single player only. For who like to play co op i suggest you should go play other game that support online multiplayer than this one.*
1;As a veteran Monster Hunter player (since Freedom Unite) I can say that this entry is one of if not the best in the series. There is much more freedom than previous titles as well as no loading screens between the areas of the map. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do either single player or co op. This game does have a learning curve but it is an amazing feeling taking down a monster that was giving you trouble.
1;Overall my experience with monster hunter world is realy enjoyable overall the critics were bad because of problems that affected the matchmaking system as it disconnected you from the session but this problem was fixed in the recent patch.If you like grind in games i totaly suggest world as its well thought mechanics and graphics make this experience far more enjoyable
1;The frequent disconnects from Online Sessions makes the multiplayer mode unplayable. Capcom doesn't seem to be doing anything about it so that basically kills the game for PC. Don't waste your money on this unless Capcom fixes it and you see verification that the problem is resolved.UPDATE While still not 100% fixed it's very close and is now playable in groups with infrequent disconnects. I can now recommend this game for PC gamers!
1;Seems most launch issues were fixed. Worth the buy if you like the series. If you are just getting into Monster Hunter this is the best game in the series to start with. Plenty of play styles and weapons to choose from monster and enviroments look amazing and each fight is fun though some can be a little frustrating. Be wary if you don't like grindy games though this series is full of grinding the same monsters over and over to get the pieces you need.
1;This game has been out for a month. I don't play that much. I only have 375 hours on it but its pretty good. some of the monsters look cute and I just want to cuddle them. Since the game came out I had some dreams about me playing this game. I like the game
1;200 hours in. The best Monster Hunter yet! Old school fans might not like some of the changes however I think they improved alot. For example no more paintballs to figure out where your monster flew off too! The world is also a single zone so there isn't loading from area 1 to area 2 etc. I also don't feel like you're fighting the controls in this.I wouldn't try this game without a controller. That is a must!
1;This is an amazing game. I played the PS4 version for 300+ hours and still am having a great time. The PC version leaves a little to be desired considering its extra development time but it is a minor complaint. I love the weapons the monsters are fun to fight and the gameplay loop supports a lot of replayability. When you watch the opening scene and experience the horror of the english dubbing and lip syncing don't worry eventually the Handler shuts up.
1;the game is great...but u will have hard time connecting for online play.... i would not recommend buying it atm untill they fix the conectivity issue. but do buy it if u enjoy playing the single player mode.edit conectivity issues are fixed.... but it's still day 1 gonna give it few more days to see if it's really fixed.
1;Highly fun very few problems so far with playing with friends. Not a perfect port but certainly playable/enjoyable! Mutiplayer in private session (only with friends and without extra people) has not had any disconnects like I have seen in other reviews.
1;Honestly i didn't experience many of the issues of week 1 2 that people were complaining about. I've sunk a pretty decent amount of time into this game and i still feel no where near finished with it. Was it worth $60 on release? Probably not since the overwhelming majority say there were bugs and glitches out the but right now I am running completely smooth. Take that for what it's worth.
1;When i first started playing this game I gave this game a positive review. Now after clocking in 90 hours I'm still giving it a positive review. Bottom line it's a solid game that's worth every cent. There are a lot of bugs but bugs can always be fixed when given some time. To me all that matters is if the game is fun. Because at the end of the day it is just a game. If you're on the fence don't listen to these crybabies just get the game. It's worth it
1;MHW is a refreshingly original game from monster hunter series with strong human element it makes the player really feel like batman and the difficulty of the game can be viewed as the dark souls of monster hunter series too bad it has too much water 10/10 just like cupheadPS i hear the multiplayer is f*cked up but i'm a solo player so that really doesn't bother me
1;Good game. Good graphic. Newbie friendly. An interactive environment and gameplay. Capcom really wants to widen their demographic player. Started from MH ps2 MHFU and now this.Plus Newbie friendly. Story mode.Negative Nargacuga. Miss that buddy.For you who still has connectivity issue. Advice from MHFU.Git Gud in an offline mode while Capcom patching the game. Just give them time.See you soon in the next 200 hours.
1;I7 4790 and geforce 1060.Game runs perfectly and no crashes or connection issues so far. Now talking about the gameplay its perfect. im loving the heavy bowgun so far and the changes to both bowguns.The introduction of the interconnected map is awesome you no longer have to wait to load between areas and the result is a monster hunter title more dinamic.
1;it's a shame the multiplayer component is not working correctly. constant disconnects makes me think that capcom does not give a damn.UPDATE 08/23/18 they've actually done something about the connection problems it's not perfect but at least it's a step to the right direction. very hopeful about the state of the game.
1;You know what? Screw connection and graphical issue just buy the game and start slaying bunch of big dragon. Wear their skin use their bone and horn to make weapon. Swing your towering sword like kids on sugar rush. What could go wrong? And finger crossed you wont be kicked by random mid quest connection lost.
1;This game is fantastic if you have some friends. Right now there are some annoying network issues but hopefully they get fixed soon. One of the best games I've played in some time highly recommended if you have buddies. Probably still alright alone but the team makes it so much better.
1;It's cool after all it's a Monster Hunter series.Nonetheless prepare yourself for the ultimate loneliness experience.Join a session hunt with 4 players disconnected hunt alone for 4 players portion.Multiplayer experience is extremely bad.UPDATE the connection problem is rarely happening now.Hop in and enjoy the ultimate game of the year experience!
1;Very fun and challenging fights. One day you wafflestomp the monsters the next they are making you cry home to mama. Teamwork is important but the fun thing is to try the different weapons the game becomes fresh and you can play different roles. Very easy to get into and out of so you don't have to stay committed if you have IRL things to do. Best to play with friends and SOS for help. Yes there are bad players out there but you'll also meet good ones. Go have fun now!
1;Amazing achievement on the part of Capcom never has a MH title felt so fully realized to the original vision then World a really great achievement. But the performance issues and multiplayer connectivity issues make this review a temporary No. Keep your eye on Capcom and when this mess is over with pick it up.Edit It looks like the online connectivity issues have been fixed hanged my negative review to a positive
1;Aside of the connection error the game is really fun to play. Amazing combat systems playstyles and features. Adding some of the monsters from the previous MH is a nice touch to the game. 9.5/10 for the game 5/10 for the multiplayer servers. (Hope Capcom will fix it as soon as possible)
1;"""It's your classic Monster Hunter Games with a lot of quality of life improvement and the graphics is gorgeous.If you are new to the series this can be your first jump into the series.You hunt monsters and their family craft weapon repeat until you became the monster itself 11/10.*notes """"The game is too hard"""" is a bs try it for yourself they probably never played any action games."""
1;Pretty nice transaction. I know many people are complaining about the connection and many weird bugs but as far as I know these are more correlated with Steam its new UI rather than game itself. For most of time I have no problem with connection.But most importantly this PC version is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING with the control. I am personally not used to PS4 controller and the PC version hunting is much much smoothier.
1;Can actaully have a pet cat in this (im allergic to cats).... and its not a massive ! and also get to kill big monster guess thats fun aswell.... nah its awesome!! im playing it on high settings at 4k with 60fps most of the time. i7 4790k 16gb ram and 1080ti.
1;IF you are looking for a great action RPG this is a must buy. Just like all RPGs there are lots of grinding involved but the repeatable quests in MHW is just enjoyable. Everytime you hunt there is a chance to improve. The online game play of joining others frequent DC if you tab and not being able to watch cut scenes as a party when playing through the campaign sucks. That being said still a GREAT game to play solo or with friends.
1;I have about 400+ hours on this game its a fckn awesome game dont get me wrong but it kinda feels like it gets more repetitive and i feel like there s nothing more to farm. (I have 4 attack jewels lmao and most of the jewels i need for my sets i mainly use GS Lance and Gunlance) . hope we get more events like console does but until then i think im gonna stop playing for a bit. Hello car mechanic simulator 2018.......
1;One of the best RPG game on Steam. Brings me back when I played Monster Hunter on PSP. Monster Hunter as a series is one of my favorite games of all time. I hope you guys can look ever the trouble of the release of MHW. The connection problem will be fixed in the future. Happy Hunting fellow Hunters!
1;They finally released a patch that fixed some of the issues that were present such as the stuttering in the recess and the stuttering against Teostra. Now that the developers have shown that they care about this port and the endgame is playable I can recommend this game because the gameplay I awesome and the port is now good.
1;It's a good game where you tickle lizards. You might have to do some research to get it running swell on your machine but it's fun to tickle lizards and you should try it. Can't think of a better value for your money. More lizards coming in the future. It's finally here boys. Our prayers have been answered.
1;When I bought it I knew we were gonna have issues with the online It's the first MH on PC!. I love the game I held on buying it on PS4 and I think it was worthy. They'll be fixing the online implementations so this community grows and extends this amazing game even farther.The game itself has pretty good upgrades on gameplay and has an approach to new comers with the quality life modifications.
1;as a long time fan I can say that while the game is perhaps too streamlined compared to previous iterations. It's a fantastic experience with a new sense of freedom in playstyle movement and progression.10/10 will continue to slap wyverns with sharp pointy things for days to come.
1;Excellent port from the console version (being a controller user) and with the super fast loading times with a decent PC makes this so much faster and easier to go out and hunt all the monsters into extinction! Updates (both content wise and settings wise) will only make this better more accessible and more enjoyable.
1;i played all the mh since the first one for ps2... and this last one is amazing .. cant wait for the new monsters come out .. and i hope they bring the swimming monsters to this version along with new maps .. my favorite monster is the lagiacrus i hope i can fight him in mhw soon
1;+Here's a solid GOTY contender with awesome gameplay beautiful graphics and wonderful soundtracks. Probably hundreds of hours of fun content and enjoyment. Oh hey that sounds pretty cool.+It also has some connectivity issues. Piece of game go die Crapcom how dare you treat your fanbase like this fix your game.60% of reviewers probably...
1;Great game I just wished it had more of the old bizzare humor.Yeah the handler is more or less personified glutony but I have so many fond memories of the Guild Sweetheart messing up nearly everything she says or does or the Guildmarms loving personality and her monster fetish (remember her love letter for Brachydios?) this representation is very tame in comparison.But at least it has Monster Hunter Language as voice language and it has Poochie now easier to pet then ever!
1;I recommend this game regardless it is really fun.Steam this next message is for you.What you gonna do about my 200+hours of play that was quite literally deleted yesterday after i updated steam?Currently very ing mad and going through story AGAIN after i had finally hit HR49 to fight Tempered Kirin.
1;Amazing game. Connection issues and some optimazation issues aside I'm having a great time. It's all I play anymore and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. When they fix the current issues the game will be one of the best I've ever played and for sure one of the best multiplayer games on PC. Great job Capcom!
1;Definitely scratches a certain itch the core loop of hunting monsters to craft better gear to hunt more difficult monsters will keep you quite busy.The way the multiplayer co op is implemented is a bit shoddy sadly having to have watched a cinematic to play a story mission together and occasional connection issues.Recommended for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of grind and constant 'boss' battles.
1;Is this a Half life reference!? The char NEVER talks... so whats the pointon selecting a voice in the creation panel? just for random moans when you fight?can't skip cutsene... srly some cinematics are just for you to start in front of the monster...It's rly good but there are some annoying issues with the game.
1;Been playing it since it came out and I still find it fun and enjoyable. Majority of the people complaining are about not being able to play online which isnt hard to figure out if you search it up. sure the cutscene thing is annoying for online story multiplayer but other than that its simple to figure out. i do wish it was more open world and would have been nice to see players walking around in astera.
1;Hitbox is somehow broken from time to time. but anything else this game is pretty much RNG. Hunting the same monster over and over again and kill off their generation *cough* just to get what you want. At the end of the day this game is all about collection and have a blast with friends together either hunt some big or small monsters or do some really fun challenge created by friends. Oh last but not least Attack Jews is a myth btw. Happy Hunting.
1;i have tried rage games before. i have died a million times in darksouls but i never ever been so frustrated with anything more then the 9star arena quest. u cant counter build u cant choose ur items u cant choose ur wep. the diablos chain stun u and just spam borrow attacks wtf is this is this suppose to be fun at all? just being slapped around? this is just lazy endgame. nerf urself down to maximum and face the most annoying monster fight sense Tkirin.....
1;in terms of gameplay monster hunter world is a GREAT GAME but i would not reccomend spending money on this game at the moment because you cannot connect to multiplayer and many connection issues with the game i would wait. also experiencing a bug where you try to change applications and it sends you to a black screen forcing you to restart your computer. so i would wait until they fix these things.
1;Runs just fine for me despite all the bad reviews. Controler worked fine for me without any problems or setting up.Looks great and plays great. I wish multiplayer was better its harder to play with a friend than I like and some missions have to be started solo. Starting solo seems dumb when they let you call for help half way into the mission. running at 2k with a 1080
1;very fun game. port works fine for me and i havent had any problems with it crashing or stuttering. i have played every mission of this game so far with my two friends and have never had any problems connecting to each other. if you have a good pc i see no reason not to get this game.
1;Played the PS4 version really realy hyped for the PC version the port itself was acceptable for me but it is unplayable with friends since you can't even connect to a lobby. If you are lucky and able to get into one and even started the quest don't bother as you will lose connection 5 mins into the quest. A negative review until they fix the connection They fixed everything great game.
1;lower requirements can play this game and online dc and frame drop sometime but no problem.480p low borderless fullscreen volumetric rendering off / 22 30 fps720p low borderless fullscreen volumetric rendering off / 9 18 fpsi3 2100ram 6gbgt730 2gbwin 10 64bit
1;Negative reviews is just outrage because of the current issues with the game. People saying not to play and calling it garbage but I see 150k players in game right now just saying.This is the first PC monster hunter game I'm not surprised that there are issues espcially since it's a port. If the issues NEVER get fixed its one thing but there hasn't been enough time to made that verdict yet.
1;Despite the constant disconnection this is a gigantic leap graphically speaking from their console counterparts (I had 550 hours on the PS4 for this game upon writing this review)...they DO need to fix their server issues which understandably this is their launch and hence I will wait patiently for it.If you are a big dark souls fan this is a game for you D
1;I will change this review into blue after someone gives me a working tweak which disables mouse acceleration motion blur and depth of field.Edit They fixed it to an acceptable degree. Took them only 2 months. I stopped playing 3 weeks ago because i have nothing to do anymore and waiting for content. So here you get your beloved blue.
1;Tee El Dee arr Adun I like fighting the monsters!Just quickly pasting up a positive review since Steam is mad at a good game.Fighting the monsters is deliberate You can't button mash in this one. You need to watch the monsters and figure out what they're going to do and from which direction you should approach them when you attack. Don't get mad and mash the buttons!
1;The Game Is Very Good And Well Made And It Passed My Expectation Gameplay Is Great Weapons Are Cool And Armor Looking Awesome But The Only Problem Is The Multiplayer Session And Its Connectivity Issue Pls Fix It. The Session Keep Losing Connectivity Out of the random . Hope It Will Be Resolved Soon
1;"""Monster Hunter World without the ROCKET POWERED GREATSWORD """"Oh hey! I just killed/captured a monster in 15 20 minutes! I feel great!""""Monster Hunter World with the ROCKET POWERED GREATSWORD """"HOLY F*** WHAT IS THIS DAMAGE!? QUEST CLEARED HR 999"""" *Drowning in rare decorations and gems*oh yeah and it a pretty good game btw."""
1;The game is not without its flaws but they've gradually been getting addressed and the feeling you get when you finally down that monster after trying so hard is just so satisfying. There's tons of customization and every weapon has a distinct feel that lets you play exactly how you want. Every monster feels like a boss and challenges your skill in unique ways and heavily your rewards those who can push their skills to the ceiling.
1;Everything is Fixed The game is a Blast with friends they made all sort of changes from the older gamesPros Everything is just amazing Animations Graphics Maps etc lots of Quality of life changes no more Combo books!Cons its stupid easy compared to the Previous Games300ish Hours got 12 sets more than 30 weaponsMHFU or MHP3RD 400 hours 3 sets 5 weapons so yea the game is way WAY shorter
1;It's a game that's all about fighting single powerful enemies. And sometimes watching them kill each other which is even more fun. Combat rewards tactical thinking with a wide variety of playstyles provideed by different weapons and each weapon has different tools for different situations each of which is crucial to success.
1;"""Never before has getting beatten down relentlessly by two wyvern at the same time felt so good. If the thought of """"Oh i really need to go to the bathroom right now but I think i can fit one more hunt in"""" EVER comes across your mind while playing this I strongly suggest that you do not follow through with that thought. love this game."""
1;People are mad that the update schedule isn't as fast as they want. I'm happy to say that the game is worth it. Plenty of content and all additional monsters armor and weapons are FREE updates. Only paid items are cosmetics and emotes. Plus this is the first Monster Hunter on the PC so things aren't going to go as smooth as they would like. You can't just port over without effot. People just don't like to wait and have nothing better to do than post a negative review.
1;400+ hours with 300+ HR and theres still a lot to learn from using different weapons on different monsters with different builds. It's the little things that will keep you keep coming back otherwise it's just speedrunning and the waiting game for new content to arrive.
1;I have changed this review from negative to positive after the connectivity patches MONSTER HUNTER WORLD is marketed as a multi player co op game but in reality it was a single player game for a couple of weeks after launch. The game's connection issues have been patched and it's now fully playable online.
1;An higly addictive game plagued at first by permanent errors regarding network.Things seem resolved but it's quite a disgrace to see that happened.It's my first MH game and i have good times with it. Progression is quite slow but the game give the envy to push even more.MP is quite fun too but beware with your stuffs on expert monsters can be ultra lethal if you are not prepared for it.Right now I recommend this game with no problem at all.
1;Now has a good build. Very playable. My quad core processor and 4gig GPU are a slight generation behind and still runs at a nearly solid 60 frames. Don't worry about the mixed reviews they are old reviews by people who's moms won't buy them a better pc.Great game for people who like gear farming and having sweet boss fights all the time.
1;They dont call me Levi Ackerman for no reason with dual blades.Gameplay is nice I haven't experience any crashes at all.Able to play with friends just fine.One downside I have with this game is joining the friend if they are ahead or behind a cutscene which makes no sense.
1;The game reminds me of Warframe by the fact that you have to go on missions to get the parts/material for new weapons. But it also reminds me a bit of Darksouls because they have a similar combat concept. Overall it's a really enjoyable game and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good game that resembles either of the games mentioned above but also to anyone that is up to trying a new game.
1;Great game. Only slight annoyance is the story missions revolve around telling your friend to wait till the cut scene is over before letting them join don't quite get why they couldn't go the route of forcing all players to watch it/skip it but it will only plague the first few hours of the game and even then it is not as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be. Once the cut scene is over you can hop right in with them.
1;Don't let the naysayers discourage you game is fine atm and not hard at all compare to previous titles of the series. Always prepare for the hunts and you'll be fine. It still needs some performance fixes tho (CPU usage is way too high).Overall one of the best games of 2018.9/10.
1;MONSTER HUNTER WORLD 285hrs casual playerGame is all about grinding (farming materials for weapons/armors or consumables). Can be played solo or coop with 3other friends. enjoyable either way.cant wait for new updates to add in the other monsters.also hoping for new fresh monsters and locales to make game more interesting and refreshed.
1;9/10 because it's too Demanding for Ressources with that kinda unstatisfying graphics. Gameplay is great Story is whatever. Muted &amp went afk/minimized the Game in pretty much all cutscenes. Awkward voice actors in german. Also they lock content / bugfixes and bring them over time ...shady move.
1;I'm one of the few people yes they exist who got lucky enough to not have many technical issues theres a few rare fram drops but thats it. I hate to see this games reviews getting tanked so hard due to such a problem and I think it deserves way better. From my personal experience 11/10 bananas please goty right here
1;Now that the server issue is mostly fixed this game is a masterpiece. Whether you're a Monster Hunter veteran like me or new to the series this game is without a doubt worth every cent. I'm residually a bit sad that the issues were there but it's well supported dev's seem to mostly listen to community feedback one example being the mouse camera changes and it's an incredibly fun experience. Put your money on this game if you somehow haven't already.
1;Finally what we've all been waiting for a REAL Monster Hunter game on PC!Solo play is fun and challenging and the multi player is chaotic and a hell of a great time!Heck if after 150+ hours of play the game is still fun that's a good sign in my book. Not to mention several updates keep adding new quests and more monsters to slay.
1;Decent port online is a bit broken right now. Works most of the time (for me anyways) but other than that easily worth a buy. Very fun game.Update as of November 27th 2018 Game runs way better now than it did on launch pretty much no more fps drops. Online hasn't had a single hiccup in the past 14 hours I've played (started playing again a week ago). Only thing that's still a minus is the fact that we're behind on content compared to console.
1;Don't listen to the nay sayers about this game. It's honestly extremely fun to explore and fight larger than life monsters. Sure some people have connection problems but thats part of online gaming. The unique weapons are extrme fun and the graphics are beautiful. I'm really glad to see monster hunter taking steps to move into the next gen and stop looking and playing like a ps2 game.
1;Fantastic game but the decision to drip feed players with new content that is around for a limited amount of time outside has been puzzling. Previous MH games released the event quests and you got to keep them. This time around the inconsistently available endgame with the lack of G rank really has me disappointed. Do not get me wrong this is the best MH title mechanically speaking however from a content point of view there hasn't been so few monsters in an MH title in quite some time.
1;The main goal of the game is to fight the same monsters over and over again to learn more about them so that you can more easily defeat them (while also using their drops to improve your loadout). If you're not into that JRPG grind probably not the game for you. Much easier online / with friends. I enjoyed the game much more than I expected to!
1;Hunt monster get parts make gear repeat. Not for everyone but if you are a fan of previous games the quality of life upgrades are amazing. That and the constant updates like any Monster Hunter game make for an experience that is well worth the investment.
1;This port was done excellantly while the networking was off to a rocky start when first released it has since been much better plus the constant stream of updates and content of monsters and equipment makes this a really well done and enjoyable MH game for new players and veterans
1;This game is the most addictive game I have played in years. Dragon's Dogma esque combat with unique area and monster designs. I've enjoyed playing the game solo coop with friends and coop with randoms. I'm told the fun is in learning all the weapons but I'm quite happy just being a hammer bro. I can definitely see myself playing this game for years to come and possibly following the franchise closely from now on.
1;Probably should not buy this unless you have a lot of experience with Monster Hunter games or friends who do. This game needs more than a few patches.There is an addictive and amazing gameplay loop in here somewhere though.Edit The big issues have almost all been fixed. This game is absolutely amazing and addicting. The depth of the gameplay is basically unparalelled. Can't wait for the sequel and for more content.
1;"""If you come from other harder and grindier monster hunters you'll definetly dislike this one it's like a """"casual version"""" of the real deal.That being said it's still really cool and a good time with friends. The game really makes it hard for you to multiplayer the out of it... but it's been one of the best multiplayers of the year for me and my group of friends. Just make sure to use the equipment appropiate to their level."""
1;I have already put almost 130 hours into the game and I'm still not technically finished the story portion of the game. I have been enjoying every minute of the game so far. I am new to the MH franchise but I am definitly a fan now. From having access to all the weapons at the start to learning how to properly counter a monster it has been a wild ride. I'm looking forward to the other events that come out for this game!
1;Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game to play by yourself or with friends! There's a whole variety of weapons that cater do many different playstyles and whole menagerie of beautiful and well designed monsters to hunt! The team really did a fantastic job researching zoology and ecology in general the monsters really feel like they're animals with unique behaviors and not just some creatures standing around waiting to get pummeled by the players.
1;Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game to date! The gameplay and world are immersive and fun. I love the Monster Hunter series and have played it since PSP era.The texture settings are still broken and are worse than the Xbox One X version. Please FixOn an SSD a quest loads in 3 seconds. Coming from a PS4 where the loading times took literal minutes sometimes this is amazing.
1;Well you probably heard people praise this game for like a thousands of time nowbut i'd say it deserves all of it the combat is amazing but i play on a toaster so i couldn't talk much about the graphicalso the amount of free contentI recommend you to try it out and Iceborne expansion is dropping in 2019 too
1;Absolutely excellent game (as a Monster Hunter newbie always eyeing the portable consoles and their easy access with envy) whose technical issues at launch have pretty much been fixed. Lots to do fantastic gamefeel (tm) community largely not populated with pillocks.'s good.
1;as a long time monster huinter fan I will say that this is a good game but it reminds me a little bit too much of the wii game in that there are not all that many monsters to fight or equipment to craft relative to the ultimate/unite version of games but that will most likely be fixed if they make an ultimate style expansion
1;A fantastic game with great depth and love poured into it. The PC control scheme is a bit rough but you get used to it (or can change it) very easily. Solid gameplay stunning visuals. High skill ceiling and very good community to answer questions and provide tips/assistance.
1;Fun game. Most fun to be had for me is with other players. Hunting big bad monsters is fun and there are enough weapons to keep you busy! Slowly catching up with content released on consoles already so no worries on that front. Can see myself playing for quite a bit more.
1;Pros Amazing environmentAmazing soundFluid controlsQuickly catching up to console eventsConnection has improved a lot since releaseCons Feels a bit easy after a some timeNeeds more monsters (especially non wyvern monsters)Weapon design seems lazy for a lot of weaponsAll in all it's still a really good game especially since my last MH was MHP3rd. 9/10 would watch my friends get yeeted across the screen again because they misread a monster attack
1;i love this game to the core of just how fun it is to play with a group of friends and smack the hell out of a big dino and then make cool amour out of the dino you just killed and repeat it but each can have different outcomes due to different playstyles or just the enviroment change or even with different bigger dinos getting in the way but i heavily enjoyed this game.
1;Great game not perfect however the grind is fun until is not game is dependent on new beats to maintain the fun of the grind at least on my opinion since you can learn each beast pretty quick and once you learn the patterns it becames more mechanic and therefore less fun.Apart from that the game is solid really fun and a great variety of weapons and armor.
1;I really love this game only thing i don't like about it is that it takes a lot of my CPU and Memory. other than that it's a solid game that i would recommend for people who likes to whack a car sized hedgehog lizard or a scaly kitty that hates everything with a burning passion.
1;Good game good fight monsters do have some cute reaction and movement fine storyline don't mind the character detail there are always mods you could use connection issues are resolved if you love some good grinding and fine combat game go ahead and buy it!
1;I love how the battles feels rewarding for with each battle I get to know more of the weapon dan monster. Not everything is obvious so looking at outside sources for tutorials and insight really helps to find new ways of fighting keeping the game feel fresh.
1;Live out your life in being a hunter! This game will let you challenge yourself in many aspects such as analyzing the monsters building gears and such. It is a very hard game but with your friends and with the community you can reach greater heights. You can still solo but it is more fun and helpful to join other hunters in the quest of being a great monster hunter.
1;Been playing Monster Hunter since the first one came out on PS2 and while I certainly don't speak for everyone I've enjoyed the heck out of it. I have no issues with endless crashes or bugs like everyone seems to complain about but that's just me. A good way to kill time and enjoy the game for what it is the next step up in the series. Hoping to see more like this and more for consoles like Playstation Xbox and PC.
1;Great to play solo or with a group of friends. Lots of monsters to hunt and the different weapons each give a different approach to hunting. Many quality of life improvements over past installments make it easier for new players to get into the game but don't detract from the experience for veteran hunters. Bug fixes and new content has been steadily improving the overall experience of an already great game.
1;I don't know if I've ever been as excited for a port of a game from consoles to PC as I was waiting for this game. Monster Hunter World hit every expectation I had coming from previous monster hunter games while also bringing forward great quality of life changes and ideas. I preordered this game with my friends and it was the greatest two to three month binge I've experienced in a long time I love this game and it is very well worth the price and Capcom has pulled through for us once again.
1;One of the most fun games I have ever played. I played this game for over 200 hours on playstation and bought it again a few months after It was out on PC and its still just as fun a 2nd time around.The frame rate and graphics going from the normal ps4 version to this is well worth it.
1;Great monster hunter experience the conectivity issues that it had after the launch have been fixed for the most part.Great game with a ton of content if you are looking for a monster hunter experience this is a great enhancement of the original formula.
1;I bought this game on release and WOW did it surprise me and still surprises me today. They just keep on adding more and more content back to back. Very fun to play solo and even more fun with friends. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes to spend a lot of time playing a game and collect everything that is possible to collect!
1;A lot of Variety with 14 different weapons great visuals nice music different monsters challenging yet fun fights/mechanics and the updates seem to be frequent. It is fun with other people but it is not impossible to solo I recommend at least 2 player coop so you can get 2 players and 2 pets (palicoes) in fights.
1;Capcom's first MonterHunter game on PC this game game is really fun there is a lot to learn in the game I m still learning and evolving as a hunter and would highly recommended this game to anyone especially those who appreciate action RPGs with good build diversity plenty of customisation and depth.
1;After years of waiting i can finaly play MH with my friends on PC. Well... we have a legal way at last.Yes this game is a bit different... few simplifications are made to make this game more friendly for a newcomers. But still it's MH game. And God i love MH.
1;This is a good game. I have not played any previous monster hunter games but that didn't matter in this one. The game is well put togather and altho a short story is still lots of Fun!Very few bugs mostly just conection issues (which have be improved alot)I would give the game a recomendation to play if you like killing things.
1;Until they Fix their servers and multi player sessions im gonna down vote this. yes you can play solo ok but when in multi player sessions? slim chance for completing a quest with the team. also they should put up a reconnect option.They have fixed the issue eversince the 2019 kulve taroth started the disconnection issues came back again.
1;Monster Hunter isn't for everyone.But for players that have played previous titles of the same game.This is a must try. Because compared to the previous titles that makes you tear your hair during high level hunts Monster Hunter World can let you solo every Monster without any frustrations. (Take note the hunt is not taking candy from a baby but not as hard as generations)
1;One of the best game in the monster hunter series. Personally im a monster hunter veteran played the game since it came out on psp. I would say mhw is some what simple to understand and they made the game quite friendly towards new players. I would say mhw is one of the easiest one to play of all the mh series.
1;As a long time fan of the Monster Hunter franchise I was thrilled with Monster Hunter World a game that managed to improve the recipe of its addictively fun predessecors while remaining more accessible to franchise newcomers. The satisfying pattern of hunt craft graduates from handheld systems with honors in this gorgeous big game safari RPG.
1;Be the meowster hunter this world deserves...1. Track the monster down2. Fight the monnster3. Kill or capture the monster for its parts5. Repeat6. ????7. ProfitBeyblade beyblade let it rip! (If ur trying to play with friends good luck not getting disconnected tho happens often)
1;This is the most amazing game of the year! (For me at least!) And thus I have followed this series since PS2 titles came out! I'm glad CAPCOM decided to try something new now! Keep moving forward CAPCOM!I highly recommended to those who are new to play this game with your friends! It is fantastic game that you won't regret at all!
1;Monster Hunter World sets out to simulate a living and breathing ecosystem and absolutely nails it. Monster Hunter hasn't felt this fresh since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and it does that by not only returning to it's hunting roots but also expanding that concept in a way the fans of the series never thought possible. This game marks a turning of the tide in the series and it will only get better from here.
1;Honestly one of the better games I've played in the past 5 years. Really really good gameplay. Good grind if you're into that. No grind if you don't want to play big boi endgame. It's for everyone to be honest.Has some issues on PC but imo none that keep the game from being worth it's money.
1;Simple pros and cons.Pros Modding community is available and active. Beautiful graphic. Can be further improved with reshade. Free DLC. I have fun slaying monsters. I enjoy watching people cart. I enjoy watching my friends cart.Cons Capcom gave a non answer statement on modding. Cheaters??( I have never encountered one yet.) RNG heavy. If the idea of killing the same monster 100 times is not your definition of fun I suggest you find another game.
1;An excellent example of a bad launch done well. The game had tons of bugs and a terrible control scheme and CAPCOM fixed most of the issues and are continuing to fix the other ones. Overall the game is great in it's current state. The monsters are challenging and rewarding to beat each map looks amazing the controls are much better but still need some tweaking and the soundtrack is amazing.It is fairly grindy especially in the late game but if you enjoy that then this game is a must have.
1;Excellent game with a diverse range of monsters to fight and lots of opportunity to customise your character to your fighting style.Co op play is great fun but connectivity can be a bit sporadic and you can find times where it is difficult to connect with others.Graphically the game is superb with lush detail rich environments.Definitely worth playing!
1;This is the first time I've ever written a review so I decied to make one because this game is just too good.Me and my friends we've been looking for a good grinding and game then this game got released.This game got everything right. The cinematic cutscene the big monster and the feeling in every run.The whole experience is marvelous btw the feeling of cutting big monster's tail is so satisfying I tell you10/10 would grind again
1;This is probably my personal favourite installment to the Monster Hunter series. The quality of life hcanges for me are really good and the gameplay is really really smooth as with all games released on new platforms for the first time there are some bugs and issues but they are no deterrant by any means.
1;"""Very good game. I had some issues with performance due to the new nvidia graphics drivers released for this game and uninstalling them turned the game perfect. The only problem so far is the poor multiplayer matchmaking which is very unstable and usually pops out messages """"connection lost"""" even when playing offline.***Updated great game playtime shows it all."""
1;One of the best games I have ever played. It s magnificent. The scenarios are breathtaking the dificulty is great the chars are divine it only lacks a more lively main character but it's not a big problem. For me this is a game I will hardly ever forget. Thank you capcom for creating this. Thank you.
1;Love the series and this one continues to deliver! More open worlds than the last monster hunter games more unique move sets and all around a better experience in terms of access to things. All though the content is lacking compared to other MH. But they are still adding Monsters so hopefully it grows!
1;"""Cannot stop playing this game. Fun and engaging combat mechanics.It is Dark Souls like boss fighting game. Removing all the boring running about and focusing on what is important Killing big bosses/monsters.Anyone that likes challenging boss games must play MHW. It just sucks you in and before you know it your """"Just one more Fight"""" becomes your whole night."""
1;Finally the monster hunting experience comes to the PC and it's definitely worth the wait. The core game loop of hunting upgrading and hunting some more is very compelling especially with all the quality of life upgrades to the gameplay systems over previous entries to the franchise. I enjoyed the time I spent playing and would definitely recommend it as an introduction to the genre as well as for returning fans.
1;A huge step forward in visuals and accessibility for the MH series. Significant quality of life changes were made no more maps broken up into smaller zones items used for resource collection no longer take up precious inventory space and your character can finally drink potions and walk at the same time! As always playing with friends is a blast. 9/10
1;Really amazing game play encouraging strategy rewarding teamwork flawless enemy design difficult but not impossible soulsesc game interesting and expansive envirenment believable monster anatomy... Holy Crap the list goes on!!!!9/10 Rating. Guys you got to make this game part of your library!!!!
1;You finally get lucky on Melding some decorations get a Critical Boost earplug and fire attack set decoration from the streamstones are super hyped dont even click anything but the back thing and immediately loose all of your decorations.happened twice now THANKS and goodbye to my critical boost earplug affinity sliding.... and all the time i wasted farming them. Would have been nice with you
1;like most all monster hunter series grind grind grind and grind but thats how mmorpg i. the graphic is good if you ever feel bored with it try other weapon its fun learning a new thing. also if killing and capturing is way to normal try kill the monster using the enviroment like dump water flush the rathalos down and kill itself or crystal drop and kill the monster. hoping capcom does give that kind of archivement
1;Game is fun has a HUGE learning curve for weapons and monster behavior but in the end it pays back (you won't die as much... unless you get hit killed by Kirin. Watch out for Kirins. You'll know when it's a Kirin)Play it with friends i recommend that those friends start the game with you. You can play with Mouse and Keyboard just fine have to get use to it tho...
1;If you got friends and enjoy pounding monsters. This is the game for you. Yes there is connections issues sometimes. However it is continually updated behind consoles. Graphics are superb game replayabiliy is high. End game grind may be an issue due to RNG but take a break and come back with your friends to beat down the new monsters. We got a steam library full of games after all.
1;Good game. Most bad reviews are about the multiplayer which is fixed for mostly everybody with non doodoo internet and how it crashes on them when their computer got doodoo specs. Story is a bit doodoo but the gameplay itself is very beautiful and the good kind of doodoo.
1;I love this game and i wish i would've known about it way earlier in the days of my nintendo ds. Now that i can play it on PC I am very satisfied. I would love to have more Monsters though not new ones but rather the old ones so that i can get to know em better too. I would even pay for them in the form of a DLC if need be.
1;I've played this game now for more hours than I thought I would. Really fun to try out all the new builds and new monsters. Every time I think I'm done with the game it pulls me back in with some odd equipment or build. Way more fun with friends but the SoS system is pretty fun as well. Capcom is definitely trying to fix some of the early problems and PC is now almost caught up with console. Look forward to the future on this one.
1;I originally got this when it first came out and can say that I was not disappointed at all. The developers keep pushing updates to put in more monsters and keep the game interesting with events and armor sets. The most tedious part is the grinding but once you get past that it quite fun. A good way to deal with the dread of the grind is que up with some friends and have a good old time killing large creatures with oversized weapons.
1;Monster Hunter World probably the game that I've been waiting to be ported on PC since it's PSP days. Surely I will pour a lot of Hours into this game. The only thing that I am waiting is for new contents but lets all be patient. We know that the developers are doing their best for the game bringing bits of content to us. Lastly I give my heartful thanks to all who worked for the game and delivered/ported it on PC!
1;"""So many quality of life improvements over previous Monster Hunter games. Less content than previous iterations but more than enough for a few hundred hours of play. The decorations system being entirely RNG and requiring ridiculous amounts of farming is a little frustrating and the """"accelerated update schedule"""" of content on console was a bit of a lie."""
1;One of the most enjoyably replayable video game experiences I've had in a while. With such a substantial amount of creatures locations weapons etc. from which Capcom can draw and further expand in future DLC's I think MH W has the potential to be the definitive Monster Hunter experience.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter Game.so saying that. I can happily say i enjoyed every moment in this game.It has never been more exciting to kill monsters and get cool armor and awesome weapons.My only problem is it's a little confusing to get started in the game and you need to farm a lot but other than that.I can recommend this game.
1;Not the best Monster Hunter game in the franchise but not that bad. Also the only Monster Hunter (besides Frontier which isn't available in the US) that's currently on PC. Biggest problem I have with it is the fact that decorations are RNG.1 attack jewel / 7 would recommend
1;It's pretty good. People need to chill with the bugs and infrequent server lag. This is Capcom's first time porting Monster Hunter to the PC. They listen to the playerbase anyway when it comes to issues. Kulve Taroth is bad tho. Def recommend buying this game as is or even better when it's on sale. Grab three friends and be ready to lose hours hunting for that 1% Gem.
1;The game is a legend. Sure at times it will feel rather repetitive but that's a part of it. You kill one creature first to be able to kill another and that's pretty much what MH games have been. The scenery is awesome lots of badass monsters (though I think they should add more) gameplay is smooth imo whether you play on a KB+M or a joystick. +Super fun with friends cos there's so much to learn in this game.
1;What a great game. Mixed reviews dont do it justice. Most negativity can be pointed to glitches and errors. My advice is if you're on the edge maybe give the game a try and hover over the refund button if you're unsure if the game will underperform on your computer.I can't get enough of this game. I can't reccommend it enough. Nominate it for Best Environment or Game of the Year fellas.
1;i'd say it got more contents now. updates are coming almost every week. new events and collab happeningalmost catching up with the console contents. its not that bad. fixed almost common network issues. but honestly theres still some. some texture bugs but doesnt affect gameplay . might say this game still need more optimization. fighting lunastra and teostra at the same time give massive fps drop. (SUPER NOVA UNLEASED XD) needs a few more tweaks and its perfect! 100% worth it.
1;The die hard fans of this franchise will tell you this game is horrible. but i'll tell you as someone who didn't plaay any previous ones... this one definately seems better...maybe it depends on taste. i prefer open world RPGMMOs no loading screens too much grind and your mom nagging you to stop playing all the time. if you like that as well... then this will tickle some of your fancies... 5/7 would get destroyed by behemoth again
1;"""Finally they are keeping their word with the """"accelerated releases"""" business. Seriously that abhorrent terminology should be erased from this world but that aside as the last major drawback being the lack of monsters from the slow update is being handled I can finally give this game a positive review. For now.Just add some more monsters that are not inherent clones or colored """"AT's"""" with buffed stats and I'll be happy to burn another couple hundred hours into this game."""
1;Not new to the series however still love the OST and gameplay of the game. Will recommend to anyone who loves hunting large monsters. Might be a little hard at the start for beginners to the series though.The connection errors are still there at time of this review however it has gotten better (at least for me and my friends) but all of the main story content can be solo'ed given time.
1;Aside from the occasional multipayer hiccups the complicated upgrade system some unexplained in game items/symbols/etc. the frustrating RNG the meh story the fact that it's heavily CPU hungry I have no other complaints toward MHW. Fantastic job by Capcom to re introduce the series to a broader audience one where newbies &amp seasoned players can enjoy together.
1;"""One of my favorite games finally on PC. My third most addicting game after Mount and Blade Warband and Dark Souls.You basically hunt monsters to get new awesome armor pieces and weapons but its fun as hell. My only complain is there is no transmog so your character can look goofy with different armor piece.As soon as u start the game do yourself a favor and turn off """"Volumetric Rendering"""" and """"AA"""". Both these options makes the game blurry and ugly."""
1;Product received for free. Got this game for free with my graphics card so i decided to give it a try. Very fun and addicting gameplay that will keep you coming back for 100s of hours. The monsters are engaging and punishing but in a way that makes you want to get better and not give up. Game runs very smoothly and content is being released at a rapid pace. There is good reason this series has such a cult following and would definitely recommend to others.
1;While I have dabbled in the series before this point this is the first time I've actually dived into Monster Hunter due to the changes that World brought which for me made it far more accessible and enjoyable to play. If you've wanted to try a Monster Hunter game this is a good place to start.
1;It's like a group therapy session. You and a few other people gather together a few times a week to talk about your problems. EXCEPT... in this case the problem a big scary monster. AND... your group therapy session is actually a ragtag team of monster hunters. FUTHERMORE... No one is actually talking everyone is just beating the ever living daylight out of the big scarey monster with big sticks.Just like group therapy sessions.
1;the first thing i see in this game was a lizard with dreadlocks voring a dinosuar whole with that in mind im 99.99% sure the one furry at capcom snuck that in and i am both mortified and feeling all sorts of respect for him thank you for doing this and goodnight i will now play your game until im an old prune of a human being
1;The server's were pretty shaky at launch but since then most of the problems have been fixed.It's a great entry into the series quite welcoming for any who are newcomers into the franchise. Definitely would recommend this to be played with friends as sometimes the multiplayer experience may be marred by several annoying randoms.What are you waiting for it's time to go hunt!
1;Really incredible game and the cpacom team listens to fans. They keep coming out with content for PC and getting the PC version caught up with the console version which is really great. Not to mention that their online event calender makes it easy when to expect new content for the PC version.
1;the game is really fun when the online works its great and the updates from older games like the new engine and quality of life stuff like the hunter jornal are greatTO BAD THE HANDLER IS A WHO DOESN'T SHUT THE UP AND UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES THAT MAKE REPLAYING THE GAME ONE OF THE MOST ANNOYING THINGS EVER
1;80 hours into this game. It's amazingly addictive has great environments and each type of monster is so well thought out that you never get bored learning a fight. Single drawback Definitely not made for mouse and keyboard. Get this game and a controller you'll have an amazing time.Edit 176 hours in new monsters and gear regularly in updates. Pretty great developer / game.
1;The game is an interesting addition to the MH universe.Although it lacks the huge variety of monsters seen in the previous games it still manages to be an enjoyable experience with or without other players. Sadly the PC version is behind in comparison to the PS4 version so maybe get the console version if you actually have the means to do so. 10/10 would recommend
1;Great game easier to learn compared to the main series but the end game is not that great at the moment unless you like endless farming and theory crafting. Hopefully further updates will help with that would still recommend to anyone looking for a fulfilling combat experience (or anyone else really).
1;Definetly recommend itafter 200 hours of it and still counting was fun but over time it will get repetative once you finish the storyline you will start relying on events and difficulty spikes for arch tempered and tempered monsters otherwise the game will get less fun by each passing monster
1;This game is actually really fun. The grind becomes more acceptable when you've got so many options to take down monsters the size of small houses and large busses. Playing with friends and random people online make it such a different experience because everyone has their own playstyle. Letting people be who they want to be how they want to do it with everything accessable to them makes this game a must get if you enjoy the Monster Hunter Series. 9/10 Because I hate Kushala.
1;10 years ago Monster Hunter ate up a lot of my time. As more games came out in the series I would pick them up but it just didn't grab me the way it did back then. Now with Monster Hunter World I am hooked agin.The removal of loading zones in between parts of the map QOL improvements through tracking monsters and being able to aim thrown items and additions to movesets on classic weapons have brought me back into the glorious world of Monster Hunter.
1;Enjoyed the out of it stunning visuals excellent gameplay and sound direction in general.Altough at the beggining the multiplayer was awful they fixed it after a while and most graphical problems can be solved with mods the biggest problem i have with the game is the little amount of monsters to hunt tho after around 180 hours (which is quite a lot in my standards) i ran out of stuff to do really but recommended anyways.
1;This game takes what you liked about old Monster Hunter then gives you more of it. Though there may be fewer zones than previous games and fewer monsters too that only seems to be because of how much farther they now go. Plus there has been and will be a steady stream of new monsters and new challanges to face. If you've played old Monster Hunter or Toukiden you will probably like it.
1;Been a fan of Monster Hunter since the beginning and World doesnt disappoint. It takes a lot of the core of the game and changes it to be more beginner friendly which is a good way to introduce the game to a larger audience but also still feels like a traditional Monster Hunter game with some QoL changes.
1;Engaging combat with numerous QOL changes new to the franchise to offset the grind inherent in the series. Weapons all feel impactful and have their own quirks and intricacies to learn and finding new ways to approach the fights is half the fun. The maps are lush and feel alive with their own unique personalities and themes. The monster variety is sadly lacking in comparison to earlier titles in the series but the experience has been one of the most fun action rpg's I've played in a long time.
1;Hands down one of the funnest games you can play with friends. The game doesn't sugar coat anything and punishes you for mistakes you otherwise shouldn't in combat. The Monster A.I. is so sophisticated that it reads your patterns and will prevent you from doing your 7 10 second attacks. But with the right gear and skills you can surpass these boundaries. This games Replayability is second to none when it comes to an ever expanding universe. 9/10
1;By far the easiest most newbie friendly entry to the series. It lacks somewhat in the variety of large monsters (or to be more specific some longtime fan favorites are sadly missing) but there is enough new stuff in terms of game mechanics to keep you entertained. Also yeah finally on PC. Keep them coming Capcom
1;The game is good and funny to play!Need some time to get how the fighting and the UI works.Runs constant 60 FPS whit 1080TI+i7 5930k at 2560x1440 (VRend off whit on got some drops at times).All is good just fix the servers PLS!EDIT still recommanding this game but the RNG will meke me not to play again!
1;Always knew this series was for me but previous entries never stole my time away like this one did. All of the complexity with extra polish. Wish there were more monsters but here's hoping for years worth of DLC. Game turned me into an official fanatic. Would hunt again!....and again...and again...
1;This game has a myriad of problems some of them have been fixed many of them still persist.I still recommend this game because I truly loved the core gameplay I wouldn't have recommended back when multiplayer was unplayable but now that those issues are mostly fixed I think you should at least give it a shot. PD Capcom get your together and finish fixing this game most of the bad reviews are well deserved.
1;"""First impresion Awesome!Update It WAS awesome.... Every 10min Disconnects! DAMN CAPCOM!!! I TRUSTED YOU! I bought a new Computer just for this Game! If i knew this i would have bought a ps4... I trusted you when you said """"We wanne make it good"""".... You deserve this negetiv Reviews.2. Update Back to awesome )"""
1;"""Mouse and keyboard is actually usable now with the mouse fix for aiming and instant """"radial"""" menu based on the last sub menu you opened. Performance could need a few more tweaks but it's very enjoyable gameplay and graphicswise. I'd recommend getting """"Improved NPC Locations"""" mod though which adds all relevant NPCs to the gathering hub to make doing anything important less of a chore."""
1;Gameplay is amazing more fluid than previous games but a little bit easier (No G rank and mantles are OP).Environment is beautiful but slow to traverse at times.Continues to provide more content in the form of new monsters and equipment (Deviljho Kulve Taroth Lunastra).Servers have been horrible at launch but was fixed. Kulve Taroth update killed them for some people again but they have been pretty good in the past couple weeks.Overall pretty good entry to the Monster Hunter series 9/10.
1;Its hunting grounds feel expansive each a separate ecosystem that would tick along nicely by itself without your involvement.It presents a near overwhelming world of possibilities for customisation and specialisation. Most importantly it s somewhere in which you could end up spending so much time you might as well be living there.Monster Hunter has always been a series that offers much and more.
1;Highly recommended there's enough content in the game to keep you busy and enjoy i'd call this game an action jrpg the grinding might not be for everyone but it is the essence of monster hunter the game is fun with both playing alone or with 3 others.
1;After 400 hours i have yet to fins a flaw for this game.... well ... maybe just one and it's name is the B52 bomber. That er really needs to retire at some point.( and i know you can make him go away... just for him to come back 1 minute later) Other than it's an awesome game very engaging and requires some degree of skill to not get rekt. 5/10 would fight the bomber again. 10/10 overall game
1;When this game released on Pc Everyone was exited for it. especially previous hunters.it had its Problems at first but The majority is Fixed now! It Was a Great Game and still is!Recommended If you have Friends to play with (single player Available)8/10
1;Update The issue is almost fixed and the content has been getting better with the new elder dragon adventure..... This game is so much fun except the moment you were disconnected from the online section and left alone to fight the monster by youself. The connecting issues get better after the patch however I do not want to face it again while fighting the elder dragon anymore. Please make sure the server is stablized so that we can enjoy such a great game.
1;The Monster Hunter series finally gets the props it deserves. A little bit too easy when compared to past games in the series but still offers about 200+ hrs of entertainment easily.After working out most of the DC issues at launch this is now one of the best co op PvE games on Steam. However it could be better optimized in terms of framerate.
1;"""Its definitely a nice approach of the game for people who are new to the series.The gameplay is really fluid and gathering is a lot faster than in the """"Main Series"""".The graphics look amazing.The online mode got improved a lot (compared to the release) as well which was the main reason the game got such a bad review score."""
1;I've been playing Monster Hunter since Monster Hunter 3 Tri and have been hooked on the franchise since. This game is an amazing addition to the franchise and I seriously recommend it to anyone. Keep in mind the only reason the reviews are mixed is because on release they had some very bad connection issues but they have been fixed since. You get some serious sense of accomplishment when you finally kill that monster that's been giving you issues and make armor from it.
1;With Great Sword and Bow playing with mouse/keyboard seems to be a more optimal choice since you'll have more camera control. Plus you're not button mashing that much anyway. Great Sword's Shoulder Tackle and Charged Blade's Guard Points are some of the unique additions to the genre. It gives you defensive options mid combo allowing you to continue your combo after a successful counter instead of resetting to neutral (like how dodge works). Pretty sweet!10/10 No need to dodge
1;I'm a fan of Monster Hunter from a long time and i'm absolutely not disapointed with this last opus.The game is beautiful enjoyable and have a long life time. Making it worth buying.The bestiary may be smaller than the previous games but Capcom already released new ones and i hope and believe they won't let down their fans.
1;Despite a rocky launch Monster Hunter World has continued to improve and stands now as a challenging deep experience that rewards preparation as much as mechanical skill. 14 weapon type choices each balanced and varied means there's something for everyone and each will take dozens of hours to master. A constant stream of new hunts keeps the progression fresh and the PC experience smooths out some of the technical hiccups of the earlier console releases.
1;This is the best game i ever played in my life . being following mh since mhfu and love this one even if it feeled casualised . The game is fun because of the gameplay where everyhit you give is made by YOU a real action gameplay ''but damage of course is based on rpg element '' you dodge for real and attack must be well placed . Ton of customisation a lot of chalenge ''not for me since its casual compare to the veteran game '' . Make sure you find your weapon of choice and master it .
1;I'll be totally honest I usually dislike games the revolve around grinding for selve improvement. But when I decided to buy MH W to play with my friends I found myself actually enjoying myself. From the satisfyingly intense combat to finally getting that decoration you've been grinding for Monster Hunter World is a game I can't not enjoy.
1;Excellent game if you enjoy methodical combat. Most of the issues from lauch like the bad connection and bugged textures have been fixed. Deviljho Kulve Taroth and Lunastra from the console release has already been launched for PC so it's actually a very good game now.
1;Fun game after getting used to how it works. It feels better to me using a controller vs. keyboard and mouse but that was before the update. Find a weapon and stick to it to get used to how it works it took me a while before I was using mine efficiently.
1;After about 50 hours in I have completely fallen in love with this game. Me and my buddy picked it up and we hunt together religiously now. Huge beasts every encounter is like a unique boss battle and there are so many monsters to fight. After all this time I still haven t beat the story! Worth every cent! Highly recommend. Easy to connect with others and great optimization I run medium settings 1080p with 4770k and an RX 460 16 GB Ddr3 1600mhz 40 45 fps
1;Probably one of the weakest monster hunters in term of difficulty but still is fun to bonk monsters with giant swords and hammers. All monster hunters are GOTY on the year that they came out.9/10 Monsters are too easy and not enough quests are hard to keep you wanting to challenge yourself. Edit actually now that lunastra is out I take back what I said about not being hard
1;There's alot of fun to be had in this game Especially with friend it's a great feeling to take down a huge Monster with a bunch of friends and have an epic fight I've taken lots of awesome pictures during this game and i'll never forget the fun i've had with my friends during this game A very good job to those who've created it.
1;Simply iconic. If you haven't played a Monster Hunter game before you should. Choose your weapon any of them seriously. Giant fire axe that transforms into a sword? Sure.Sword and shield that combine into a mega axe? Sure.A basic as katana? Sure.Guns? Sure.Just kill things.
1;I've loved this series since it's start on PS2 but World was the first real big game changer for the series since its portable entries into the series. Lots of new features and quality of life changes but it's definitely still Monster Hunter and that's beautiful.
1;I have been waiting for a pc version of monster hunter for years. This game is exactly what i was expecting. Nice graphics i can use either m&amp k or any controller i want and a decent ammount of content. I only hope they release some kind of dlc with a snow themed map.
1;The new Events this Game bring is filled with Excitement. I like the Weapons that you can get from the event bosses some look cool and some look kind of plain but still strong to use. Plus im Hoping to expect a new way to capture monster that you can get as a Mini Companion that can fight with your Palicoes.
1;Great game. Was riddled with communication errors whenever I tried to online play with friends but they fixed that very quickly. The gameplay is fun frustrating at times but only at yourself for not being good enough. Great game definetely worth the price. Deluxe edition not so much. Also the community is great super helpful. I reccomend checking out the discord and subreddit there's useful info all over.
1;Runs absolutely fine on max settings at 1440p on a 8700k/1080TI frames remain over 60 load times are almost nonexistant especially compared to potatostation and xbone. The mouse/keyboard controls is actually quite useable but I've been playing the series for long enough that I have to default to controller at least for melee weapons and I've had no issues once I figured out the new options for controllers and camera options.
1;The game is everything that we wanted before. The downloadable extra things are exactly what they are extra. The game scales well and you don't really need to grind too much when doing the story line. The community is great and helpful when trying to put in for missions and help on missions through the game.
1;Rough launch where many of the negative reviews seem to be coming from but definitely had quick patches that have resolved many of those issues and quick content updates. Been playing this almost exclusively since it launched. Game has many QOL changes that many may like. Graphically it's good but don't expect something super beautiful although the enviroment is visually very beautiful.
1;MMO ish grindy loot collecting (cos Kulve) and repetitive. But goshdarnit this game is fun. It's fun whether with friends or just other players. You will keep coming back for more eventhough you've slayed that monster a gazillion times. The devs are also (still) adding on new content for your hunting pleasure. All in all great game to play but most importantly a fun game )
1;As a monster hunter fan without a nintendo this game is a gift from heaven. Last time I played monster hunter was more than 5 years ago with my good ol psp. This game has alot of new features since then and I'm looking forward for more.Overall rating 9/10
1;Everything is awesome when you're part of a team despite ther netcode dropping me every hour or so from my team. (So sorry for that teammates!) Despite its small flaws its a great game hunting down monsters with various weapons from the Gutzu Giga Blade to the Bagpipe of DOOM. It does get grindy at the end as all games are want to do but IMHO its worth it. Sooner or later the P.C will catch up to the consoles but intil then we get to hang out with the Dante Luna and KT quests.
1;Great game. Slaying giant monsters with friends is the best but the game is enjoyable even when playing solo.The only flaws are Heavy farming / grinding for resources unnecessary complex mechanics and statistics and the game lacks some minor quality of life features that would make the gameplay smoother.Strongly recommended even if you're new to the MH serie.
1;Great game im running it on my laptop and they fixed most frame drop issues. The game still has some microfreezes but that doesnt really bother me. The gameplay is great and the important dlc is free. btw the negative reviews are mostly incorrect or from people that care to much about looks. Edit cuz steam nominees they are really catching up to the consoles with us getting kulve lunastra AT kirin and some armour sets in the same month.
1;Never thought much of Monster Hunter until I played Dauntless it was fun but felt very empty so I checked MHW when it came out on consoles and I was hooked and knew I had to get it this was and still is the most fun I've had on pc this year making weapons armor armor for your cat fighting huge monsters while waltzing through the air with the insect glaives fighting with other players beautiful world epic music events all the time this is just fun and awesome
1;I wasn't sure if this game was for me. I've heard nothing but great things about BUT that it's also kinda niche in who it appeals to. And I can say without a doubt that I am horribly addicted to this game. There are times where I want to pitch my controller over the balcony but after coming back and re assessing my stratagies I can overcome my previous monster encounter.That being said the game isn't perfect. There's a lot of clipping and some odd hit detection but man...Is it a hella fun time
1;the game is good and the core mechanics are mostly solidI wish there was more to it but story is just there to be there so don't expect much out of it. It serves its role as a vehicle to introduce you to the machanics and monsters of the game but nothing more than that. I didn't think it was possible for a game to have negative character development yet somehow the characters get even more boring and generic the further into the plot you get
1;The newest next gen entry of the long running series Monster Hunter. This game does a couple things wrong or overly casualized and the servers were a complete disaster on launch (fixed now) but it's also an amazing game with some of the most satisfying gameplay i've ever experienced and i'm saying this as someone who played the original game back in the day
1;I honestly find this game extremely fun and keeps you invested for a very long time. There's tons of monsters to kill/capture armor to acquire and weapons to forge. Sometimes it's very grindy but playing with friends makes this game less tedious. I recommend if you want to have a lot of fun.
1;The most gorgeous Monster Hunter experience.This version includes a lot of quality of life features that make going back to MH4 a chore. While some aspects of the game are simplified for a more general audience I believe it still makes for an entertaining expirience.
1;Great story awesome environment and really nice looking graphics.100% fun regardless of if you play Single or Multiplayer.What else do you need in a game.Can probably be a bit difficult sometimes... but that is what makes it more fun to me.100% recommend!
1;A really good game with some minor yet very annoying issuesPros GraphicsEnvironmentFun SoloFun MultiplayerFun gameplay mechanicsCons Multiplayer has lots of issues and annoyance1. Its such a pain and a hassle to have you and your friend join someones SOS(impossible or almost impossible)2. Gathering hub is so useless (only active in Kulve Taroth events)3. there are no guilds
1;Been waiting for this the whole year watching youtube on the console versions and building up the hype....Now that i have it i am loving it and it is everything i expected it to be making want to come back everytime my very first time playing monster hunter of the whole series and hoping they bring more to pc in the future!
1;As this is my first Monster Hunter game I can't judge if the mechanics are better/worse compared to the previous ones. However this game is noob friendly hard at first but easy/moderate at end game when you're finally getting used to the game and fights when you're grinding for armors weapons throughout the game. Beautiful graphics and music. Although there are some connection problem occsionally.
1;Controls might ber confusing at first if played the previous games but was better because of the quality of life additions they made.One of the most prettiest Monster Hunter game I've played as of now. Chaining stun and paralysis is so fun.10/10 will buy DLC if it comes out.
1;great game i really like monster hunter series. but still bad optimisation )1080 and i6700k not enough for ultra 60fps in 2k resolution? is this denuvo problem? or capcom can't optimize game? it's horrible.the thing is if my pc have 40 50 fps (yes it's fine for me.) how many you should get? slideshow?
1;This is a great game for people who are new and old to monster hunter. I'm not sure what keyboard controls are like but I highly reccomend using a controller. The story isn't that great which is typical for monster hunter but there is so much stuff to do.
1;Some will call this a grindfest but when the grind is this fun who cares?Great graphics sound and gameplay. I suffered disconnects when i first bought it but they seem to have been fixed.Frequent updates and events from Capcom. Definitely money well spent especially now the price has come down.
1;Probably my favorite Co Op franchise definitely a great entry into it. MHW is without a doubt my favorite game to play at the moment. It is amazing to look at and super fun to play. THe game mechanics are fun and enthralling. No two hunts are the same.
1;"""In all the time I have between this release and the PS4 release I can safely say that this is the best MH game to jump into if you are new to the series. It has the most accessible weapons and mechanics and most importantly the easiest camera controls.After like 400 Hours between PS4 and This release it still holds up. If you think you've hit the """"end"""" then you should definitely play with friends and just meme it up."""
1;"""Monster Hunter World has been a gift that keeps on giving. By the time I thought that I was finished the game throws so much more to do and explore. For me this game has been the greatest """"childlike wonder and fun"""" type of game in quite a while. I've had genuine fun and will always look forward to trying out new things and toying around with different equipment.I am not an online player so the connectivity issues have been a very minor problem for me.TLDR The game is fun play it."""
1;Overall its a great game. The story is fun and introduces you perfect in the game. It keeps a good balance between telling you how things work and figuring things out. The late game is also great and you can spend a lot of time with it. It was my first Monster Hunter and i had no problems wahtsoever. Great game for startes and like my friend told me also for veterans. They added and are adding a lot of content and events. 9/10 You should play it.
1;I play it for fun. To be really honest it is fun. Whether you're playing alone or with friends. The only downside is the unskippable cutscenes but other than that it's fun! If you're a veteran monhun'er then you're going to find this one relatively easy.
1;don't mind the hate comments. yes multiplayer sometimes doesn't work and it can be a bit overwhelming to monster hunter newcomers. but it's arguably the best mh installment ever in terms of graphics and gameplay.EDIT there's so much grinding after the main story. you are really getting your money's worth. plus with crossplay on the horizon the community is going to be more connected with each other. f*ck pc masterrace t
1;"""Best with friends(or strangers) DIt's very satisfying running around and discover the world of MH W. Interestings monster even if some of them are just a """"recolour"""" or """"reskin""""Annoying that they wont """"fix"""" the Steam friend invite system. I guess nobody cares..."""
1;Multiplayer had some issues but devs are actively working on fixing it. Gameplay is great aside form a couple wonky issues (no raw mouse input) but nothing thats really worth complaining about.EDIT The devs fixed most PC issues raw mouse input included and even gave some huge QoL changes like easier radial menu navigatioon. Capcom is working hard to make this game fun.
1;"""As someone who didn't pick up on Monster Hunter until Generations Ultimate I assume I could sorta count as a newcomer. This game is LOTS of fun kinda BS sometimes but that's part of the fun. Veterans are complaining about the """"Casual izing"""" of their series... I can't really see how. Things are balanced quite well for the changes like the huge overall world. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who has the spare cash for it."""
1;A game u would like if u loved dark souls but with a more complex quest progression and variety in terms of weapons armour skill building. Recent news has shown Capcom is listening to their community with an accelerated launch of new monsters from console (endgame).
1;An interesting and annoying solution to how you join multiplayer Althought the game is clearly designed to be palyed whit at least one friend. Alone you won't get anything out of this but even with one friends this can be fun for more tah just one hour.
1;If you're a veteran MonHun fan and you're worried this game has been ruined don't worry. It hasn't. I personally really like the changes to skills giving you a lot more freedom in mixed sets and not needing to use a spreadsheet to figure out what armor set to make. It takes some getting used to but it's worth it.
1;You want your friends to play with you in this game. It's just not the same getting absolutely torn up on your own. You will think you are hot stuff when you beat Zorah Magdoros for the first time then he will be your grind till you get mediocre clothes and then realize you aren't fashionable at all or you missed the wiggle head. Kill things wear it's skin force your pet cat to cosplay hate Kirin forever.
1;This is the only Monster Hunter installment that's been able to hold and keep my attention. It's quite a blast with friends and though it does have slower updates than console along with some online issues the develops have consistently worked hard to fix or accomodate this and have begun speeding up PC updates. I'd grab some friends or even go solo because every moment of this has been fun.
1;Monster Hunter World has been an interesting game. It started out pretty bad with connection problems but overtime Capcom has been improving the game every month. New monsters and events about every month. Just wish it wasn't a port.If the game is on sale I would recommend getting it.
1;If you love absolute end game grinds this game will frustrate you. But if you're looking for a stunning open world hunting game the MH W is a game you should try out. Some reviews here are outdated but the game has matured and been updated ever since.
1;Incredibly fun to play. The new monsters takes time to get use to but that is three quarters the fun.Sometimes it is easier to solo monsters than it is to play with a group. So if you ever get frustrated with PUGs or friends bringing you down solo it.
1;A game you can play solo when your friends aren't around and a game you can play multiplayer when they're back so you can show off. It's an amazing experience and a ton of fun to play but don't get too OCD about minmaxing the rng after you finish the story. Just trying to save you some sanity.
1;After basically all the connection issues have been ironed out this is definitely a great spot to start out for the MH series runs fairly well on most machines and is a much better experience rather than on console just for the sped up loading speeds alone although content does take a fair bit longer to get ported over but what are you gonna do.Lots more fun with friends but still an alright time on solo. Lots of things to do and collectGenerally a pretty good time
1;Product received for free. You can easily get $1 per hour value out of this game The only negative is that endgame can kind of just be RNG Looting trying to get the one item you need for that one thing you want. Oh and everyone you play with will get that item before you because luck hates you. This game is great tho and my my mate bought it for me so naturally I have more hours in it then him XD
1;an excellent entry into the series. wile the game is a bit lacking in content more is being added over time with regular events. this entry managed to make the more niche monster hunter brand far more well known in the west and has the future looking good.
1;This game is everything I hoped it would be. It's simple really.Break the neck of a few small monsters quickly.Take what they have and strap in on a preffered stick.Now use said preffered stick against a slightly larger monster(s).Break the neck of that slightly larger monster take the good stuff from said larger monster and strap in on another stick.Rinse and repeat.and by all mighty cheesus does this game got many necks to break.
1;When I first started playing this game it caused a lot of pain and grief. The constant connection errors the bosses becoming stronger because of that and being completely new to the game it was a mess. However after the many updates the connection errors getting fixed (at least for the most part) and my friends coming back to the game for this reason the game became very fun to play. At its current state I would recommend to buy.
1;There are only two kinds of people when it comes to monster hunter. Those who love it and those who haven't played it enough to love it.Has top notch environments and a world that feels alive. A decent character creator and a robust combat system. I love the game. I could say more but I'm lazy. If you like games that require grinding for equipment and skill reliant combat this game is for you.
1;Buy If you like hunting monsters a solid grind loop for 70% of the game enjoy preparing for a fight.Ignore If you don't like having your tail carve occationally or frequently getting handed to you if you don't like hack and slashes preparing for a 15 50 minute fight.
1;Sometimes simplicity is the philosophy to adhere to when making a game. Monster Hunter World is a game emblematic of this. At its core it is a game about hunting monsters. Within that simple premise however is an endless amount of nuance depth and variety enough to last you hundreds of hours far past when the credits first roll. With new content being constantly being released for free there's always a reason to log in and stab slash shoot or smash a monster to death.
1;Never played any other MH before who cares its about the monsters not the hunters starts game in max detail... (has a ggaming laptop) crashes changes to medium plays 100 hours crashes changes to low...now it feels like im watchiing a 144p youtube video not crashing anymore 200 hours...still grinding that one goddamn stupid item you need for your ultimate build.
1;I love it. This has gotta be the best game to come to PC this year if there is better I have not played it. I've been a MH fan since the first release and I had started to grow tired of some of the minor issues like wasting inventory space for Pickaxes Bug Nets and WhetStones. THIS game fixes those plus you can MOVE while using most items? That blew my mind. I have over 120 hours put into this game and I'm going to have a lot more.
1;Most of the issues at launch has been fixed. Admitedly I play on a controller so I cannot comment on how well the m&amp k controls are now but there have been some changes made in previous patches. Content is releasing back at an increased rate with none stop updates into december. Really worth the pick up now.
1;It's just my kind of game. I enjoy the grinding and farming. Though it might not be for everyone especially if you don't enjoy RNG drops (which I personally don't have a problem with). To me the game is like all the things I like about bossfights in action games all made into one game. It is really good if you have friends who enjoy it too.
1;Love this Game. Playing MoHu since MH portable 1. and it has come a long way )its lots of fun and has amazing gameplay. If we now got the awesome weapon and armor designs from the previous installments and some more endgame content ill be even more happy P
1;If you like to hunt extremely well designed monsters and is not a person that is swayed by grinding then you should definitely consider giving Monster Hunter World a go. It is well worth full price. Especially since the game is constantly updated with new quality events and mini expansions which is all added for free.
1;first proper monster hunter on pc had a rough release plagued with performance and connection issues but was fixed non the less. given the delayed release of the game compared to consoles the free content as of this writing has been on an accelerated pace (kulve to code red then lunastra now) and hoping to someday be on same release with console.518 hours and counting!
1;Ignore all the negative reviews pointing out the network issues 99% of it has been fixed and I have been hunting happily without disconnecting for hours on end.Took a long while for the game to mature on PC but after several months of the Devs hard work this game is easily a master piece for any new or veteran monster hunter fan. Highly recommended with friends!
1;This game is amazing. I've put so many hours in and haven't even crafted half the items I want to. The content might look small when you first start playing trust me you unlock more craftables than you can handle. It can be grindy to get some of the more powerful weapons and armor but as long as you don't use the same tactic every time it will remain fun.If I were to compare the combat to something think of a VERY relaxed and forgiving Dark Souls.
1;It's really good if you are a Monster Hunter fan you can't go wrong with it.If you are new to the series this is the most enjoyable.If you are a die hard fan like me you'll miss a lot of what makes Monster Hunter a great installment on this franchise however the DNA of the game is present and yes it's good and definitely put a smile on your face.
1;"""An outstanding achievement for a long running """"category all on it's own"""" RPG series. The mixed reviews might say to be wary and there are certainly things that the port misteps with but this is without a doubt a labour of love and a remarkble adventure."""
1;Frustration is part of the features for those who enjoy a challenge there are many ways to overcome every situation. Varieties of weapons customizeable equipment allow anyone to find their playstyle and adapt to differing challenges. It may not satisfy those who are looking for an ever changing battle this game may be better suited to those who like to work on perfecting their abilities
1;Awesome game to run around and kill time in HA. Killing monsters with friends and pimpin your dude out with different things is fun. Not half as grindy as i feared. Really enjoyed this hope more PC ports come in the future would play the out of them! I played it a bit on Nintendo DS loved that game too but OMG i love it! Especially with friends
1;What can I say about Monster hunter? It's every looters wet dream.. Farming for those wonderful weapons and armor pieces till you make your Ultimate build and just kick as you can tell by my hours that keep going up I have tons of fun playing this and always will have ) Capcom still adds new stuff just today we got a new Monster to fight! 10/10 would buy again.
1;A fantastic game to play with friends or by yourself in many different ways that keeps pulling you in more and more into the game. If your just a casual they game does hold your hand..... a bit too much i could say that can ruin the fun of the game (ex. The Handler). Never heard of played the game and think that it is bad? Just buy it and play it you will change you mind after a couple of monsters that are just amazing exept a few lazy designed monsters but are still fun to hunt.
1;While extremely clunky at release most issues have been resolved. The game still satisfys the monster hunter itch and while my playtime is much less than what I spent on this with PS4 playing solo feels brilliant the multiplayer is good fun especially when taken more casually which this game feels more at home with than other entries in the series. I hope lots more content comes out for MHW and I would reccomend it to people wanting a chill long term and rewarding game. Fashion &gt Stats
1;Good involved gamplay. Many options for weapons and tools. Still getting new content.If you liked the previous Monter Hunter titles you'll like this one. It's a bit more streamlined and the jump to pc didn't hurt the gamplay at all. Recommend playing with controller though.
1;Hunting monsters with friends has never been funner.PROS Beautiful scenery detailed environments graphically soothingMouse supportSmooth gameplay during huntsEngaging storylineEndless builds to explore and progress towardsContinuous updates adding limited time &amp permanent contentCONS May become stale as your hunter rank drastically increases (grinding intensifies after beating main story)
1;Weapons &amp armor? Checked.Solo experience? Checked.Coop experience? Checked.Environment &amp monster symbiosis? Checked.Map design? Checked.I'll pay for new monster (RAJANG AKANTOR UKANLOS NARGACUGA old mosters. ADD THEM ALL! ) &amp new maps (ice map that need Hot Drink anyone?).
1;As someone who grew up playing Monster Hunter Games on handhelds I can truely say that Monster Hunter world does not dissapoint. Easily one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had and I can highly reccomend it to both veterans of the series and newcommers.
1;The port still pretty bad but if you got friends then it all worth it. I recommender you go to nexus and mod your game with visual enhancement quality of life stuff and most importantly harder quests mod to have something challenging to do after things become stale and too easy.
1;As someone who played this game for a long time this game can be played solo but is best to be played with friends. Although the story system makes playing together annoying compared to previous monster hunters the content after it just makes everything good to play with friends.
1;This is a great game the game play atmosphere the tasks are immersing.There is a great degree of freedom any play style is viable you can customize your play style has you wish with a wide array weapon and armor.Very intersting comunity lots of achivements and extended gameplay.Continous new content.Very recommended.
1;A really good game I just finish the story line and it was fantastic. As for now the game is not to grindy and not realy hard. I also used to have connection issue but updating my driver fixed all my problem..All in all I realy enjoyed my time spent in this game so far and I recommend this game to anyone who like this style of gameplay.
1;This game is amazing. I have not played any Monster Hunter since the fourth and I am so glad I decided to come back. The worlds look amazing the monsters are breath taking and it is all fluid without the loading between zones on hunts. This entry is also a great starting point for anyone new to the series who wants to hunt some big bad monsters. The only thing I can say bad is that i play with a controller and I am so used to playing on a handheld.
1;A great game for people who enjoy the routine of grinding monsters for loot to grind higher tier monsters for better loot. Most of the technical issues involving multiplayer connectivity have been addressed and patched. And with the constant updates with new monsters what is there not to love?
1;"""The """"mixed reviews"""" for this game mostly come from server issues around its launch and those have been completely fixed. I would reccomend the hell out of this game in its current state the combat is amazing and there is a massive amount of content to get into."""
1;I give this game an 9/10. This scenery is beatiful playstyle is fun and playing with friends is amazing. Definitely suggest this game for other people. The only thing I thought was strange. Is that you cant do a story quest with a friend when you're and the same storyline quest.
1;"""No matter how frustrating the game and the grind for new gear and new weapons is I keep coming back for more. Capcom releases new content very frequently to give you additional things to do/accomplish even after you """"beat"""" the game. If you like a game with a learning cure and that is a challenge then give MHW a go...you will not be let down.9/10"""
1;I would give this a hard yes to those who don't have friends to play with and a REQUIRED for those who can play with friends. So many monsters and options of how to play are avalible and intuitive once you get a hold of the controls but god damn is the best part the enviroments. I've never felt more like I was in an actual ecosystem inside a game before now everything feels just..... right.
1;This is my 1st Monster Hunter game from the franchise and I originally thouight i'd be over with it once i finish the story. I later found out that there isn't much really a story and its just fighting monsters over and over again. May sound dumb but as of writing this I am already 300+ into the game and i don't see myself dropping this game soon.
1;You either getting an ASMR running around in the beautifully detailed environment fulfilling your sadistic Lust by killing multiple BigAssMoFkin Monsters with your BAMF weapons in a few minutes/secs or getting sexually frustrated with it's RNG BS.AND FOR GOD'S SAKE ADD MORE VARIETY OF CHARGE BLADE!!!!!
1;Game of the year for me!Specs i5 4590GTX 960 4GBI get 60 fps with everything on lowest.I also appreciate the devs commitment to providing the best experience they can. They've fixed connection issues mouse and keyboard issues and they've increased the rate at which new monsters are appearing as to catch up with the console versions. I am excited for what the future of this game holds!
1;For the first ever entry of a Monster Hunter game onto PC it's been a pretty good one. While there were major issues when it first launched the developer has been pretty good at fixing those right away. Though if you decide to get this you will be making heavy use of youtube videos and wiki sites to actually figure out how to get better.
1;The point of this game is to get stronger to kill the monster that rekt you early on. Then get even stronger to kill that monster even faster. A bit grindy but fun espescially with friends. * Don't mind about the mixed review this game has. The issues mosty has been fixed anyway
1;lacking in content for the moment. seriously poor show from capcom after delaying the game for 7 months. the games not bad is just a shadow of what it could be. IMO wait to pick it up on sale or once Kulve taroth comes out then at least there'll be something to do once you finish the gameedit Capcom is finally catching us up to the console versions of the game. This game is one fo the best I've played and i highly recommend it.
1;This game is absolutely worth playing. The graphic and gameplay is fantastic though they might consume more than other game. However the content is quite small for a grinding mechanic. The best thing about this game is the devs though because they are very generous to give away free content and response to fans' demand.
1;Still enjoyable after finished the main story trying out a new weapons keep my interest in the game. Can't really get tired of it with the awesome combat mechanic especially when there is a lot of weapons in the game a very good game to enjoy for a long time. Really looking foward to future events.
1;Great game. They fixed the multiplayer issue and graphics issue most of it by now. The only downside to this game is the lack of the monsters compared to the other monster hunter games.come on capcom! add more monsters! KT Luna Deviljho and arch tempered aint enough!
1;i can honestly say i have been waiting for this game since it was anno at jan for ps4 and xbox.when it came out for pc i was glad with all the bugs and lack of contect.obe they add it at and more in time so this game has only 1 title and its *get good* even in high rank u can still die from a low lvl monster. this game is always challenging and i love it )
1;Its fun to play with friendsBeautiful enviroment good sound and excited gameplayThe draw back is server's issue I got disconnect at least one after 4 5 roundsFarmming is not really an issue but later on its kind of boring because of same meanless the questsOveral it's still a very good game
1;Monster Hunter World provides smooth and flashy gameplay which sets it apart from other Monster Hunter games in the series. While I haven't gone into it I still have enjoyed playing it and I hope I will have more spare time to play it more frequently. Must play with a controller.
1;The game is fun if like solo play. If you want the game for the multiplayer Its not worth it until they fix the server issue. Its not unplayable with others because there are moments where a disconnect won't happen but just be prepared to have yourself or other drop connection mid nergi fight at the most inconvient time or every 10 mintues. I'll change my rating as soon as they fix the issue but for now not recommended.
1;The most fun i have had with a online gaming experience with friends in such a long time! Only 17 hours playtime as i write this review but i have enjoyed and have had so many great memories and moments within the game so far. And i am looking forward to sinking even more time over the next few months and into 2019 onwards.
1;Great game. Even though I have reached end game grinding for decorations/tweaking weapon builds trying new weapons adds to the game replayability.Besides some multiplayer connectivity issues which Capcom has been improving upon I just wish multiplayer wasn't so punishing sometimes compared to playing solo.
1;Although it had a rocky lauch with tons of connectivity issues Capcom put in the effort to fix it as well as adding tons of options that makes it a worthy PC game instead of just a simple console port.The updates are coming fast as well in what I assume to be after they fixed most of the technical bugs at the start and looks to be on track to catch up to console's progress soon.TLDR One of the best games this year playing solo or with friends get it and have fun!
1;The last Monster Hunter Game I played was on the PSP.And finally the franchise gets a game that got modern graphics and a release on PC!So if you even got the slightest love for Monster Hunter PLAY THIS GAME!Oh and btw. the developers keep adding content for free!
1;This game is a rare gem laying in the pile of trash that is modern AAA games.Everything was very well done and I had no issues playing through the game. It's also the first time monster hunter is on PC and I am very thankful for that. I played through the game entirely solo and have just finished the main story. Extremely fun game throughout the entire experience. This is a beautifully designed game all around. I voted this game as Game of the Year for 2018 and highly recommend it.
1;"""Early technical problems and few online hiccups here and there aside Monster Hunter World is a very strong title which will provide you with hundreds of hours of fun and challenging gameplay. Experimenting with many different weapon armor and build combinations keep the game fresh at all times. Even if you get tired of its grindy nature the """"boss fight"""" monster hunts can be enjoyed even if you play for couple of hours a week. Also more fun in multiplayer!"""
1;It's monster hunter on the PC. World is a great intro to the series with lots of quality of life improvements and a very easy challenge curve. Although I am disappointed with what they did to the bow and the new stagger animations which allow movement but take twice as long to recover.
1;You saying you shouldn't buy a game where u use your pet cat as bait and shield while u dicking around collectiong redpit to only to jump in the last minute to wack the monster with ur katana? I'd say you're type of people who get up to get your stuff and wait in line to get off the plane before it even land.
1;Honestly I get people's anger with the performance issues but this game is still absolutely worth it if you've enjoyed a Monster Hunter game in the past. It's stunningly beautiful loads of fun and is getting new content quite quickly these days. 8/10 would recommend
1;If you know and like Monster Hunter you will like this game as well.For those worried about Multiplayer I started hunting online 1 month after release and never experienced a DC. Playing online nearly every day.Community is ok. Not as good and nice as in the 3DS titles but still a lot better then other comms (looking at you WoW/Overwatch/Dota2 etc).
1;Amazing to finally have a Monster Hunter game on PC. It looks really good runs quite well for me (apart from Kushala Daora's tornadoes) and all of the quality of life improvements they've made since the last MH game I played (MH Tri) are really welcome.Playing solo is satisfying playing online with friends is great fun.I'm happy to have put as many hours into this game as I have.
1;It released in a pretty bad state but don't let that mixed rating fool you. The game has gotten so much better with the recent patches and it rapidly catching up the console version. The combat is top notch and it feels amazing when you get that piece of armor or weapon youve been fighting for for the past 6 hours. While the story isnt anything spectacular it carrys you along nicely through the zones.
1;First Monster Hunter game for me. Me recommendation would be to go take a look at a stream and see if u think its cool. There are tons of things to do but it boils down to punch monster &gt build weapon &gt punch bigger monster &gt build better weapons &gt repeatIf you like that gameplayloop best game ever.
1;Visually stunning great gameplay great monsters interesting places and many weapons to choose from. Amazing experience alone or with friends.Had problems with connection at launch but it got fixed fairly quick. Now it runs smoothly and without a trouble )
1;Initially I gave this a thumbs down because of online connectivity issues in a game marketed as multiplayer. Now those problems are long gone and we're left with a halfway decent port of an excellent Monster Hunter game. So here's the well deserved thumbs up now.
1;Played it for about 30 hours at the moment of writing this review and I cannot sleep at night anymore. The game always makes me want to play more and more. A bit on the easy side at first compared to the other Monster Hunter games but the game keeps its challenging end game while being friendly to new Monster Hunter players in the early game. Definitely recommend this game.
1;First Monster Hunter game and almost 500 hours poured to it. Generally speaking sort of true that the community said MHW lacks lot of monster than its predecessor. Weapon design wise sort of copypasting than the previous titles with whacky weapons. Overall just pray that Capcom would blow us out with a new expansion within Feb next year MHW release anniversary (would even pay if its a new paid expansion tbh)
1;Great game sure it has fewer big monsters than bigger titles but I am not getting bored even after 100 hours. I was on the fence since mixed reviews but I couldn't be more happy with this game so far. I can't see going back to handheld addition after this it feels really good on computer.
1;I can recommend this game without any hesitation.PC version's contents are updating very well and it's following the console version very fast.Almost every other week a new content has been updated and It was very nice time.And the developers are listening user's feedback very well and I can see they know exctly what players want.
1;"""Sorry didn't have time for a review earlier spent 200 hours in this game.The combat is good the monsters are interesting (except you Lavasioth go home nobody likes you).The world is deep and well thought out the amount of weapons is incredible considering they're all unique and viable. Searching """"best weapon mhw"""" on google just brings up tons of posts of """"they're all good use what you like"""".Honestly just buy it you have nothing to lose."""
1;If you intend to play with friends that is not currently viableAfter an entire day of playing we may have successfully finished 3 or 4 quests without anybody (or most often everybody) getting disconnected.EDIT Game became much more stable and playable in a group. Getting into that group is a little odd. But as a Monster Hunter fan I'm happy with the game as a whole.
1;A truely impressive game.The coop aspects work well. The monsters are creative and impressive. The game has a feel all its own.The most amazing part is that your experience in the game is incredibly different based on what weapon you choose.The mechanics of a fight and the tacitics needed for each of the different weapons available adds a level of depth and replay value that is difficult to get from many games.
1;Having played all the previous Monster Hunter games going back as far as the original Playstation game this is the only game of the series I would recommend to a new player to the franchise the quality of life changes make previous titles feel nigh unplayable frankly.
1;Awesome game! They made so many improvements from the old monster hunter games that it's hard to go back to them. Every time I fire a flare I get 3 people hopping into my game within a few minutes. Just hope they add DLC.**UPDATE** Error Code 50381 MW1 can't connect to server.Whoever patched this spaghetti code in need a big slap in the face and needs to be fired. Goobers**UPDATE 2** They fixed it
1;I did say I'd update this review if it was fixed and I can say well since the game has been fixed and connection issues seem to not exist anymore it's pretty great. It could use some optimization but overall gameplay is fun and it's enjoyable with friends.PS Lavasioth.
1;This game is called Monster Hunter World. In this game you play as a lone hunter who has the special ability of shooting lasers out of his bowgun. In doing so he gains the attention of two Teostra guards who quickly start spaming supernovae. I won't ruin the ending for you but the everyone dies at the end.
1;Having never played a MH title i was a bit skeptical about enjoying it. MH World was absolutely fantastic and continues to provide fun times especially with friends. The music environment and monsters truly make the game. I look forward to a possible MH World Ultimate or World 2 one day.
1;Great game last monster Hunter I played was tri on the wii and the thing that bugged me most was the graphics. Waited close to a decade for it to come to pc and it has now and omg 4k rathalos yes yes yes. Yes it's grindy yes it's frustrating but by golly it's rewarding to play. Definitely worth getting if you haven't played any previous MH games and you like RPG action genre.
1;Fantastic game all the different weapons have different playstyles you can overcome any challenge alone if you're patient enough. All the monsters are varied and the world is beautiful theres so many things to do. My only real complaint is the hitboxes are wonky sometimes but it works in your favor as often as it works against you.
1;Now that it's been out for a little longer a lot of the disconnect issues sem to be gone and I've seen a bunch of my friends fall in love with the intensity that is MH I can safely say this game series is probably one of the best game series I've ever played. World has it's ups and downs sometimes but it's beloved to me.
1;Typically with games like these the incredible landscape and euphoric highs knock you flat on your for the first 14 hours and then it's just a well made game from then on. I'm over 125 hours in and everything from the enviornment to the big 'ol monsters to the great toppling of said monsters (or running from said monsters crying) still takes my breath away
1;It's a game where the mechanics are what bring you back for more satisfying gameplay than any loot boxes or other monetized BS. The challenge of bringing down a monster that shoved your face through the back of your skull (not once but three separate times) is a very rewarding experience when you finally get it done right.
1;It's a really good game and great entry point to the monster Hunter series. What was once a niche game that appealed to people with a penchant for spreadsheets comes to PC and you don't necessarily have to use a spreadsheet sheet anymore. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what new features and content will be added. I hope to see this game become a living and thriving community.
1;Oh my god I love this game. I know it's got denuvo and port issues but it is really fun. I've beat the game and finished almost everything on the PS4 version and that version has a lot more content. As much as I like more content the smooth 60fps makes me love the pc version. If you don't mind performance dips get the console versions.
1;This game never fails to make me hungry and salivate anytime i play it played over 500 hours on ps4 and played it again on pc with other friends if you like grinding and progressive buildup in gear/strength and seeing yourself improve and learn patterns of monsters this game is for you
1;I mean the name says it all. There's monsters in a world that you the hunter hunt.But seriously the game is really fun with friends. Solo is ok too but imo it feels a bit boring. Hitboxes are questionable sometimes too. 4/5 it's a good port and a good game
1;As someone new to the series and this being the first time I've delved into the world I really enjoyed playing to the end of this game. I've yet to try playing with friends but I'm looking forward to the experience. Playing solo was challenging but doable (even when you get knocked in the air over and over by Diablos like me). You can always come back and try again after you've got better equipment.
1;This is a great game for anybody wants to focus on challenging and fulfilling combat. The game can get very hard at times but always feels far.It is much easier to access for newcomers to the series but I still recommend looking up some guides or forums if you are having trouble. The game is constantly releasing new content and updates (although they are just catching up to the console versions). There has been enough fun content to keep me coming back for hours every week since its release.
1;Pros It has cats! You even can even customize the look of your own cat!Cons This game is too good it has been stealing all my free time which I should've spent studying 10/10 will ruin my life RecommendedEDIT As of end of november CapCom has added a ton of content for free and is still adding more best practise a dev can make is give free DLC D
1;A game about beating up monsters which grows into personal expierences wherein personalities are assigned to the monsters you beat up. As you yourself too assign personality to those around you based on what weapon they are using. And as you embrace the game for all of its tech and depths you find yourself wanting to improve and learn more.
1;Ive been a fan on the Monster Hunter series for a while now with the release of Worlds we got a change of pace from how the old games played and thats always something to appreciate. Yes while the Pc release isnt perfect (new content getting delayed and so on) i still find the game really enjoyable and i reccomened it to anyone whos never played a Mh game before
1;A great game it is quite challenging and will constantly punish you for mistakes. While the multi player is unpredictable in the way that it kicks you out right at the end 50% of the time it was stil great and other than that I didn't have any issues. all in all it was a great experience I loved all their other games and this did not dissapoint.
1;The connectivity has been resolved and much more realiable and stable now. The game is great to play with lots of monsters to hunt and more are coming. Old reviewCome on Capcom this is a great game plague by connectivity issue.. i cant recommend this game when i cant play reliably with my friends.
1;A very fun game to play with friends previous disconnection issues has been resolved and various PC port improvements has been implemented. Game runs much smoother and more stable compared to when it was first launched back in august. Kudos to Capcom for fixing the game. Its an absolutely beautiful game.
1;This is a good game you can sink a lot of hours into with a wide vasriety of gameplay styles a lot of the negativity is people complainig about disconnects at launch and not updating their review after it's been fixed or impatience that not all the console updates have come to pc yet
1;Some of the most fun I've had with friends in a long time. Even the solo gameplay is loads of fun but where it really shines is its multiplayer. Each weapon offers a unique style of play and most of the monsters are really enjoyable to fight. Your real progression comes from mastering the combat system which is tough but it's fair and rewarding.
1;This review is subject to change.Currently the game forces mouse smoothing and does not allow raw mouse input. Annoying for kb/m users but not unplayable.Update Raw mouse input has been implemented along with many other QoL improvements for kb/m users
1;So now that connection issues were fixed I can say that this port is great except for poor performance in The Rotten Vale and during elder dragon fights in the last area. Still this game is amazing even if it doesn t have all the content updates the console version have hopefully they bring it here.Update The Kulve Taroth patch added optimization everything runs well now. Max out your settings make your PC cry and the game will still run smooth.
1;MHW WorldA decent port of a great game. Chat is meh. Co op is hard to work with because of a need to watch a cutscene then come back to base... it's dumb. But the game is still good.I've had no connections issues ZERO.Get yourself an Xbox controller don't be using crappy hardware and you're good to go.
1;If you have a powerfull computer this is one of the best game ever built.The game world is huge but this game is made to be increase in size to be expended.More free DLC !!! and i will buy any big expansion.Give yourselve some time to learn the game if you don't know the opus. I'm still playing after 200 h+ !!!!Enjoy !
1;Easy to learn hard to master but worth every minute. The challenge of this game is very balanced keeps ya on your toes. If your having issues beating anything throw up a flare and two asian dudes will show up and wreck face and make you look like a scrub. 11/10
1;Fun game to play with friends almost scratches that Dark Souls combat itch for me. Was pretty upset with the release schedule for PC but they're exceeding my expectations now! Totally recommend this game when it's on sale just not full price. Keep in mind connection issues are pretty hit and miss you may need to refund it.
1;"""""""Good game can't wait to see what they add next."""" That was me before I had to farm Vaal for mats... three hours... just to get two fangs... and I need five for the upgrade! I give the game 4/10. Now if I didn't think the Vaal gear looked good and decided to ignore that. Then and only then will I give this game a 9/10. So much time wasted... and why did so many of the other Hunters not bring Nulls and Cleansers..."""
1;honestly i'm still not satisfied with the amount of monsters that are in as of now (system restriction isn't an excuse anymore). i started with the PSP there's a crap ton of monsters back then. still fun though but if it's not for the nostalgia i'd probably give this a thumbs down.
1;Very good game had problems at launch but now almost all issues are fixed gameplay is very engaging playing with friends is one of the best experiences you can have the game is challenging and rewarding there is always new content with free DLC adding new monsters and weapons
1;This game is really impressive accessible and fun anyone looking for an introduction to the monster hunter series should start here.The game looks fantastic and plays the same. Theres an endless amount of choice that you have in your build or weapon choice. Capcom are doing well to support it with free events and items to boot.Ive had a wonderful time with this game and will continue to sink many hours in it.I honestly cant think of any cons outside of bugs unless story is your preference.
1;This game is one of those games that I have waiting for ever senes i was a little boy. I play MH 3 and got into it then.Now I have play this in long time and I it's better in it's own waysthe gameplay is sooo much good the Graphics is incredible good from the water to the small grass and up to the sky.and the monsters are unique on it's owns ways.I could keep going and going but I think the game dose a really good job on showing what it is and what you can in it.
1;Great Game but has it limitations content wise but it give hopes for next monster hunter titles since this was the first game on this new engine and monster hunter as a franchise showed masterfull proficiency in developing their engines the next game is bound to be even better.
1;The best Monster Hunter experience out there. There are a few glitches here and there and as the first MonHun of its generation it's a little light on content but the monsters it does have are all great and the general streamlined experience is buttery smooth. I've had more fun with this game than any other game this year.
1;great game however the multiplayer/ network needs improvement. when i or my friends get kicked from the session midfight and try to rejoin for some leap of logic a person having left a quest takes up a slot for the entire mission also preventing the person that was just in that quest from rejoining. For some quests especially events that involve multiple monsters it's a huge issue as you lose 25 percent of the team and have no means of getting ANYONE in to replace that person.
1;Incredible game! Amazing visuals sounds are incredible controls could use a little tweaking but once you have them set the way you like you'll be unstoppable. Incredibly fun game and even better with friends. Would purchase for friends if only they'd play with me (
1;The aim of the game is to hunt monsters and gather their parts using these parts you can craft new armor and weapons to help you take on even bigger monsters. Using their parts you can craft stronger gear to fight deadlier monsters and craft even better gear. Eventually you'll look back at the path of carnage you have chosen think of the corpses you have butchered and skulls adorned and wonder if you should try using a bowgun next time.
1;This game is best enjoyed with friends. However the content after grinding at normal speed will feel and taste short but once all the FREE DLC comes out you will have a pleasant experience. BUT your most hated enemy CONNECTIVITY ISSUES MUST BE STRONG!
1;It is a game I kept coming back to over and over. Once you get a feel for the controls and the weapons there is always another hunt you could be working on. Another weapon that would work a little better the next time you went after this monster or that monster. Or another weapon type entirely to learn. Its beautiful environments are fun to navigate and the story works as a great way to roll out new monsters and mechanics.
1;I absolutely love everything about this game. Tons of playstyles to chose from slightly difficult combat that requires you to actually fight not just button mash and a story that may not be the best i've ever been a part of but enjoyable nontheless. Definately my favorite game ever so far.
1;Do you enjoy battling weak monsters and feeling proud in your accomplishments and then getting rekt by monsters that bring Oxford's Dictionary to help define what a monster is for you? Do you enjoy battling pickles and then tossing a vat of gold onto it and getting a gold pickle nudging you to death?Do you enjoy disrobing ladies of their fancy golden garbs and watching them run away?
1;It is a good Monster Hunter Title but if u running on a older system you might have to tune down the settings a bit.My only Complaint is that the Weapon Design is really lazy and uncreative...where u would go *whoaa* in previous games you just think..meh it has better Stats but looks the same wich is kinda sad. I hope they will add G rank at some point in the future and with that unique looking g rank armour and weapons like in the older titles
1;Most polished monster hunter games so far.. But little dissappointed with lack of contents like number of monsters and limited map choices compared to older games. It could be because of massive graphic overhaul from MH X to World.Overall its still fun with friends that never plays monster hunter just slightly felt something is missing if you're coming from older monster hunter series.
1;This game if definitely a good buy but if you want a FRESH EXPERIENCE with friends this might disappoint you a bit as the main missions can only be done cooperatively through SOS flares towards the very end of each mission which WILL NOT contribute to the story progression of anyone who is not the host unless if the mission is abandonned and restarted after the SOS flare becomes available each mission. The game itself is still a lot of fun though.
1;Brings the fantastic series of Monster Hunter games to PC for the first time bringing with it a slew of new features to make new players feel less like they're wracking their minds against a puzzle that doesn't want to be solved while simultaneusly doing their taxes and more like a hunter of great and fantastical beasts that may only be slain with the proper combination of wit preparation and razor sharp instincts.
1;If you like a chill game that also includes some really dope souls like combat and do not mind a bit of grind this game is for you. While it is a bit of a prformance hog its still really really enjoyable and if you get a friend to play with you even better.. So much fun and it will always be there for you if you decide to come back to it.
1;Beautiful Game very engaging and hours of fun.Positive + Graphics are amazing+ Gameplay is fluid but dont expect handholding+ Fun with friends randoms or alone+ Beautiful sound and music+ Massive amount of events that repeat every year+ Hard gameplay if you need a challengeNegative Sometimes frameratedrops (they fixed some of those) The Grind better get some guides ready to shorten the amount of time you use for finding that one accesory you need or weapon from events
1;The true first PC ported MH I've played so far (din't even tried MHO or the MHF series) feels great to hunt some of the first few flagship series monsters with some skill twist. Hopefully there's more and more monsters to come as well as the subspecies from the earlier franchises instead of just repasted all of the tempered/arch tempered version.
1;Over 200 hours in and I still want to play more. I am biased as I have been playing Monster Hunter since the PSP days. Monster Hunter is one of my top favourite titles and this is a welcome addition to the family. I've been craving a PC title for the longest time and now that it's finally here I can say that the wait was worth it.
1;Despite the lack of interesting new weapon designs and in fact loss of lots of old cool weapons the game is solid and fun especially for MH fans. The simplification of what I would call excess mechanics is nice too so if you have someone you want into monster hunter this is the best place to start right now!I do miss underwater combat from Tri and the generations styles though...
1;The best Monster Hunter Experince to date. Highly recomended as a long time fan of the series. The only downsides are the lack of monsters but I personally would rather they take their time and make intresting new monsters than recycle all the old ones again. That said there are quite a few recycled monsters here as well witch is somewhat disapointing but the sheer amount of quailty of life changes makes this easily the most approachable Monster Hunter game in a very long time.
1;Really great and fun game overall already played like 200 hours on PS4 and now some more on steam. Main complaints are the network issues this game has just like the console version did and performance can be better but its all right for now. Gotten a bit better after the updates still fun as always though.
1;Best Game i played this year. RUINED by the dodgy multiplayer. The amount of disconnects in a multiplayer focused game is not justifiable. FIX IT! Will change the review to positiv once your game is playable.Edit Looks like the last patch fixed all the problems me and my party had. Sure there are still some frame drops but as of now i can only recommend it. Awesome game! Now even in multiplayer.
1;An excellent transition to PC for an incredible series. Adds a number of welcome QoL improvements while keeping the important parts of the game intact. Very rewarding to feel yourself tangibly improving while climbing up the ranks through increasingly challenging monsters. Many significantly different playstyles possible through different weapon types. Beautiful modern graphics and detailed populated environments make the world feel more lifelike than ever before.
1;Have been a monster hunter fan since the First game.This has been a big step for the franchise.Finally got to see the monsters in HD.The environment is Amazing the new mechanics are awesome.Most of the things have been simplified and there is just so much to do. so much to collect.Would definitely keep supporting the franchise and would definitely recommend this game to anyone
1;Great Monster Hunter game but not really great in Multiplayer in higher level content due to the stupid scaling. It is making it very hard to break more than just a few specific parts of monsters if you even manage to break a single one. While playing single player you are able to break every single part of most monsters rather easily.
1;If you have never played this on console you would've never guessed this is a port from console! The port is so awesome I could have swear they made this for PC especially! Nevertheless every bit of the game is worth every bit. With new contents and events every week the fun never ends!
1;10/10 this game has an extremely good story line and you dont have to buy the other titles to understand the story. the combat system is amazing and feels very fluid. the graphics and audio are incredible and voice acting is good. next to no lag on graphics settings that would make my game crash on any other game
1;Been playing this franchise since MH Portable and mainly one of my childhood games in which I truly enjoy playing in solo and with friends. Out of all the franchise this 5th gen MH is great for starting out the game and it is casual friendly. In short I would recommed this game if you're a hardcore/casual player and like spending 2000+ hours game time.
1;This is a pretty fun game. The battles are easier if you play solo but it's more fun if you have friends to play with. If you play long enough though it gets pretty repetitive so if you don't like that then you may want to give this a miss. All in all I had a lot of fun so far.
1;The game revolves a lot around grinding. You either like grinding for materials to get better equipment or you need to get some friends to play with so the grinding is more fun. Overall the game looks great and is a lot of fun (while some people may criticize the pc port)
1;Best PC Game of 2018. What an amazing game. There definitely is a high learning curve. But once you start to get the different mechanics and systems you find a game with so much variety. From environments to monsters to weapons / playstyle and more. Challenging enough to keep me engaged and the steady stream of content shows that the game is being supported post launch. Not even mentioning the fact that this game is so much fun with friends in a coordinated group. Highly recommended.
1;"""Monster Hunter has always been great and been expected to be great. But what they did with MHW is totally out of my expectation. It has been a long time since the last time i felt this excited playing a game that keep making me telling my self """"just one more grind""""."""
1;This game has made it into my list of games I love. Capcom has been amazing when it comes to updates and free content. They have made a game they can be proud of and I really hope they will continue to keep up the good work.Wether you play by yourself or with friends as long as you like the idea of smacking big creatures around...or rather be smacked around by them then this game is for you!
1;Easily one of the best games to come out this year. Ignore the mixed reviews on all time the game had a super rocky launch. It's a decent port though not outstanding. If you are having trouble running the game make sure you update your drivers a bout a month back there was a driver update that fixed most of the worst fps drops
1;Though the wait was long for a Monster Hunter on the PC the wait was worth it. It might not currently have the content of the console versions but the content it has is really polished. The combat feels smoother than previous titles and the visuals are really AAA quality.All in all a really good Monster Hunter game.
1;Only has a mixed review due to old connection issues which are rare now. Fun game little to no grind. All weapons are actually viable and it's pretty entertaining getting launched into the air by a teammate only to slam your hammer down into a monster and getting a perfect mount out of it. Graphics are real nice and even my potato friends can run it.
1;It took a friend of mine to get me to try MHW but boy do i like it now.Every Fight is a Bossfight every Monster is completely different and you need to adapt your Gear to take up the callenge.The customizations is near endless granted so is the grind but this game knows how to do that without being tedious.10/10 would buy again
1;It's Monster Hunter... on PC... What more do you need to know? Capcom has done a good job catching us up towards the consoles amount of monster releases. All actual game content DLC is FREE only silly cosmetics or emote stickers cost anything as a way to help support the devs more. It looks gorgeous ontop of having those classic intuitive MH controls so it's a step up from old retro graphics... and again... It's Monster Hunter... ON PC.
1;When you want to come home to a decent challenge with a casual feel this is it no getting invaded no screaming the f bomb children no one yelling noob or telling you how bad you are.Graphics are beautiful story is compelling and it is a ton of fun what is not to love?
1;It's a good one since i waiting for. So Capcom are making the best thing that more than 10 years in this series since PS2 till PC. I hope them will give more experience for this version and add more new content to it. If someone looking for the RPG game that best to play with your guy. I suggest this one!.
1;This game has been a blast to play. You die you learn you get better then you start getting in the momentum of huning stuff all this is then amplified if you play with your friends. I had tons of fun with mine. I rate this game 9/10 only because I can't see players in the the main town that is big enough to support at least 30 players and instead can only see other players in a small small(compared to the town at least) ship deck.
1;TLDR There's so much to do every weapon makes it feel like youre playing a different game and its a fun experience.Great game bought it for both PS4 and recently for PC i've had no connection issues so far (Bought Oct. 9th) so it seems to be fixed. The gameplay is captivating and fun especially with a mate. You can certainly use a lot of hours in this game. which makes the game so much more worth it. Not many games can brag about this.
1;I love this game enough to buy it on both xbox and pc but the dlc (dances markings and stuff) are waaay better on console. Xbox had all those cool new dances in two bundles that were around about $5 or you could buy them separate. Apparently pc doesn't care about saving people money and are only selling them separately for $4. Really? so not worth it.
1;Yup. Enjoyed this game. Grouping up with friends was very difficult at launch and a lot of the content is behind the console version. That being said the game as a whole is beautiful fun and runs well. Haven't played a lot lately but 100+ hours of fun was had.
1;Product received for free. I really liked previous games and this one really was a change of pace especially because it was on PC chich was a relief for me because i didn't want to buy a console just to play one game. Anyways the game is really enjoyable weither it is hunting alone with friends or just with any other player i'd really recommande it for anyone.
1;Games great..... love it ..... fun to play and very unique in a personal and online way as well.... now they just need to impliment unique tree builds.... since they are merging FF.... get in touch with EPIC tree building like Path of Exile. and it would be pretty hard to top. Keep up the good work!
1;The game runs fine for me graphically but the internet issues make this game unplayable. The whole point of MH World is to hunt with friends but when they can't join me ( let alone run the game ) or vice versa it really loses it's purpose doesn't it?The game itself is very fun but what did you do during those 7 months to port Capcom?UPDATE 11/9/18They've fixed the online matchmaking for the most part.
1;It's a multiplayer game. With a wrong network code. Dont buy it now because you're gonna be frustrated. You want to hunt some elders? you have fully equiped team? 10 minutes into the game and network error 83 pops up and you're ed. Devs do something NOW!! about this problem cause now your game sucksEdit After resolved connectivity issues i can recommend this game with all my heart.
1;This game is amazing. if it wasn't for the connection issues I really wouldn't have anything to complain about. I do however wish there was more of a story. The quality and attention to detail are at a Dark Soul 3 level. Graphics are amazing. Game play is amazing. Animation is amazing. Game of the year in my book. I hope they keep up the good work with the next Monster Hunter that comes out for PC. and did i mention there are no Micro transactions? I hope it stays that way. 8.5 9.0/10
1;Playing this game alone is fun adding friends just makes it better and if you are bored of endgame content they are always adding different events and things to do. Even if you're bored of those you can just try a new weapon or build a whole new set to try
1;I have been playing the monster hunter franchise for a few years now and I have to admit after playing World it is extremely hard to go back and play the old games without carting a few times while trying remember the old mechanics and the old fighting styles. Now if only they would remake the old games on the same game engine.
1;I've been happy enough with the starting weapon I picked that I logged all these hours using longsword.Launch was a little buggy but i can say with my set up the game has no current issues and runs smoothly. there is content on console that is currently missing however patches are catching those on pc up fairly quick. overall solid fighting game with potential for as many hours as you'd like to put in. though the story mode itself feels short.
1;definite Game of the Year for me 2018can be a bit grindy at times but the gameplay is so enjoyable and addictive that you can just keep playing it and not even minding it. the beautiful graphics and the even streamlined and refined gameplay of the old monster hunter games makes this so enjoyable for newcomers and old players alike. 9/10
1;I am astounded at how well executed this game is. I do not enjoy a grind and yet here I am...216 hours later...absolutely loving this gameplay loop. It is so satisfying. This game rewards persistence punishes poor play but FAIRLY and is a magnificent accomplishment in design and execution. One unforgivable sin? UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. Ain't nobody got time fuh dat.
1;WAAAA the game didn't work perfectly at launch WAAAAAAAAAAAThe game is awesome and now it works fine. It's a complete game with lots of interesting monsters weapons armors and is overall a good experience. Yes I recommend it.It's grindy but yet again not because the game keeps you engaged and excited. This is my first MH game ever and I must say... Hunting monsters is hella fun.
1;This was the first time I have gotten very into. I have tried mh4u but the controls were awful on the 3ds so I didnt get past the first few monsters. This game tho being on pc and console means the controls are very nice even if the mouse and keyboard controls are quite bad and the gameplay loop is quite satisfying ). The multiplayer could use some improvement tho! ITS SOCIALIST SYSTEMS REALLY HURT IT! DAMN COMMIES! smh smh smh
1;Most accessible monster hunter for new players and also in my opinion the best. Huge variety of weapons to suite your personal playstyle. Even after you've played several hours into the game there still more to learn new ways to fight overall be a better hunter. Love it &lt 3
1;Monster Hunter World is a fantastic addition to the series it not only keeps the feel of past games in both story elements but also the feel of combat with the large monsters. The game itself has great graphics and the mechanics (on contoller) feel very smooth there are parts of the story that seems a little over blown but that is too be expected from Monster Hunter. Overall it is a great game and i highly recommend it to all.
1;EDIT 9th December 2018 Alright I've started playing it again and i gotta say haven't encountered any bugs so far. Multiplayer finally works!My Original Review Good game but the connection issues + random crashes are annoying.Will change the rating once these 2 bugs are fixed.
1;Lovely game Monster Hunter veteran since the first game I would recommend this game a lot since the expansion Iceborne (coming autumn 2019) adds G rank and a new ice world this is massive news. For those that dont know G rank is not just another difficulty mode it's a whole new game. Usually hundreds of new monsters and maps weapons and armors. I run this game at 1440p 144fps synced frames. Ultra graphics and an SSD so there are no loading screens whatsoever. Enjoyment galore.
1;The game is amazing and addicting but the connection issues are rampant and it's very unoptimized for PC. I get frame drops when people with lightning weapons are hitting a monster on the other side of the frickin map. They also just slapped the console menus to PC and called it a day which is inexcuseable. Great game but port. Don't give Capcom your money until they fix these issues.Edit They fixed everything. Buy this game.
1;1k hours and still enjoying it a good break from FPS competitive games and fun with friendsThe amount of contents that are being released are A WHOLE LOT but it is still lacking the gameplay experience when you get on High Rank and aboveMore mechanics would make this game amazing but sadly not
1;I was struggling playing this game at the beginning I can say that this game is too hard for a beginner like me (e.g. the monster is too difficult to kill I can't follow a map or directions and I get lost etc.) But once I've teamed up with friends things get easier. I'm trying really hard not to play badly PWell 8/10 and Thumb up!! I heartily recommend you to play with friends. Enjoy playing!
1;Originally downvoted the game due to connention issues and other launch problem.However times past and it is now worth its price in a sale.Great game for the standard playthrough easily 40 60 hours of gameplay before it gets a little stale.Additions for the game are great too lots to fight and do.
1;I got this game day one and I have throughly enjoyed it the entire time. The biggest complaint that I have had has been the disconnect issues that most other people have faced. I don't see that as a make or break issue though its more of an annoyance that Capcom has been fixing. The free new monsters is also really nice seeing old favorites come back has been really special.
1;This game finally came to PC worldwide. No microtransactions (yes you can buy gestures and stickers but it's nothing) the devs provide constant updates for free. It's really good.To this day the game is getting free content and even a new dlc has been announced which will introduce content of the size of a completely new game good job Capcom.
1;Great game but the multiplayer doesn't work just getting DC'ed everytime and having to fight monsters which have 2.5xhp.If they manage to fix the multiplayer I will switch the rating.Multiplayer still broken as (21st August)Edit Final Multiplayer is highly fixed now! Great ing game!
1;great game and beutiful graphics sure it could use some work but still you cant be mad at the devs for a small roster when they have to completely remodel and animate EVERYTHING overall its a beutiful game just dont play it if you dont have a lot of time. it can take awhile at the start
1;Honestly the game is an amazing experience. You could spent hour upon hour in the game world hunting for monsters or gathering resources and it doesn't get boring the feeling when you get the gear you've been farming for some times is so exhilarating.
1;Definitely a well made game possibilities are endless.. Not easy either you need to build the right armor and stuff.Asked for ultrawide support and the new update will include it so that's a very good sign from the developers. I really enjoy hunting the monsters and gathering resources. Quite expensive for a game but after playing it i can say it's worth the money!
1;No 21 9 support. Cannot play a single mission on multiplayer without getting disconnected.UPDATE Multiplayer is fixed now. They probably didn't have enough servers for the amount of players. Game is playable on Linux via Proton. Very minor graphical glitches but otherwise works perfectly.UPDATE 2 Save breaking crash on Final Boss happened to me. Luckily I backed up my save right before it happened but had I not all my progress would have been destroyed.
1;Highly recommended It's a really fun game that I expect will keep me busy for the rest of the year.The connectivity issues were fixed by a patch released on September 6th.That means no more disconnects and error messages.Runs at 40 60fps with my 1060 6GB and FX 8350 on high/highest settings.*However beware of frame drops during multi monster fights*
1;I wish I had more hands so I could give this port four thumbs down!The game is great but this port is trash. Capcom change the mouse to not be a smoothed emulated joystick allow full key rebinding fix the performance issues fix the texture/graphics issues fix the connectivity issues allow full configuration of all post processing effects. I'll change my review if the game gets patched to a decent state.Edit review changed as the game has since been patched.
1;Fantastic game neat zones good monsters tons of content. Some of those monsters attack hit boxes are a bit buggy though the monsters body part hitboxes are done well. Been told that nuggy monster attack hit boxes are a staple of the monster hunter series though. Google plessy hip check.
1;Was it worth waiting almost a year for a PC Version? Yes. Definitely YES. A great action game and a perfect addition to a series of games finally Monster Hunter comes to PC where you can enjoy hunting old and new monsters solo or with friends (4 man Coop). It's a great game for both beginers but also veterans to the series and has regular updates and events. Definitely worth it's full price
1;In this game you hunt monsters. Its alot of fun and prepare to sink alot of time into it in order to get that sweet armor set and weapons. Updates alot of the mechanics from previous MH games and makes it more accessible for new players and just overall ditches some of the old things in the previous games including leaving a zone to heal up then coming back none of that anymore since it is all one big connected map.
1;You would think that the loop of checking gear tracking and beating a monster and then making more gear would get boring. And it does... after you have learned to beat ALL the different monsters and tried ALL the weapons/loadouts. Took me 200+ hours on release and there is more stuff in the game now.Negative reviews were mostly about technical issues that should be fixed now though I can't really comment about that since I didn't get those problems even at launch.
1;AMAZING GAME.i never played this game before my friend said that i should try this.At first i wasnt into it but when i fought stronger and stronger monster the THRILL of it all... omg.I love it. Try it. Put time in it because it will be a grind like a real Hunter.
1;FIrst i was doubting if i should be the game since i played it on my ps4 pro already.But all the netgative feedback on steam about the server kept me from it.Now that i bought it and have been playing on 60 fps i never go back...Alot of people are compaining about server issues. I must say i diddnt have any problems so far.. i mean hey can it get anyworse then the 3ds versions?.. tought so ).overall i must say i am very positieve how its running so far.
1;this game would be worth 60 as a single player game. the multiplayer is just an incredible bonus. It's about 1 disconnect in 50 hunts for me so i can't complain.I really loved this game and i come back every time a new monster or event is added. Wasn't disappointed
1;great game this is my first monster hunter game so i cant compare it to others but i really enjoy it the only part i didnt like is tring to play with friends you couldnt just join a group and be there with them in the hub and leave with them also you cant join them until they watch the cutseens but over all very entertaing.
1;Great game but as of late there are networking issues for multiplayer. Set this in your launch options nofriendsui udpTurn off big picture mode in steam settings when using a controller and you should be good after a restart. I didn't come up with this but it worked well so far 8 hours without a single party disconnect.
1;An amazing experience so far. Never played this franchise before but I've always loved the art direction and the action packed gameplay not to mention the vast worlds to hunt in. Wanted something different to play and got more than I could have hoped for. A must buy.
1;Amazing game!!! As a big fan of the MH series i love having one on PC!!! Lot of great new features and hours of gameplay! Though a couple small things annoy me like the rng grind fest for decorations or the lack of armor trNsmogs luckily theres a very simple mod for that second one that even other players can see! All in all im many hours in and still learning and finding new things every day!
1;This Game is without doubt one of the best Monster Hunter games. It has many new features which add well to the existing formula. Capcom did a great job bringing my favorite gameseries to home consoles. I would recommend it to everyone who likes the older Monster Hunter games or seeks a game which offers a great amount of challenge and satisfaction.
1;You'll get alot of Playtime out of this game and for Content Capcom really REALLY picked up paced with content drops I mean COME ON in the last 2 months we got Kulve Taroth Lunastra Devil May Cry Collab Event and FFXIV collab Event and on top of that they already announced more goodies are on the way.The only thing that peeves me is the limited time events are too few and far between
1;I'm suggest all the player who love the Co Op game then this game is very worth to buy it was very fun and before this I just fun before this just only in the PSP version but untill now still have a good experince and feel fun. SERIOUSLY ITS VERY FUN GUYS!!!!!!
1;The game is amazing and addictive. Hunt to get gear and use that gear to hunt even stronger monsters. The port should have been better but as long as you are only looking for 60fps than you shouldnt be disapointed. Any major issues have been fixed outside of being kicked out of online randomly but this is still rare. Grate game with fun deep combat and satifying hits once you learn the ins and outs
1;I hate this game. I gave up MMOs about 5 years ago because they are time consuming. It eats so much time out of life. but here i am 75 hours into the game only level 15. Outside the typical stuff the actual gameplay just maeks you want to continue to beat monsters. It is like a light verison of the Dark Souls series in the sense that your first encounter with a monster results in a one hit kill. Or somehow they continuouly stun you and just come in for kills.
1;There's a lot I could say about this game but others said it just as well already so I'll keep it short.This game is huge and I mean huge. Deceptively so. The combat takes some getting used to but it's quite rewarding once you do and it scratches both the RPG power up itch and the action combat kill stuff itch. I highly recommend it.
1;Awesome game with interesting gameplay especially fun to play with friends. Provides new stuff to learn even when you've played over 100 hours cause mastering all the weapons and techniques takes time. Issues exist (connection problems complicated UI annoying npc's etc) but I think the game is still overall a very good experience my favourite game of 2018.
1;Substantially faster runs than tri which is where i came from. That being said you lose a lot of the versatility in a controller namely the large number of keys that are easy to press and hold at the same time. Without a mouse that has at least 2 or 3 mousekeys the game is playable but very inefficient with many moves being difficult to use. There are still issues with connection but altogether it's an excellent game
1;Beautiful detailed environment. Complex weapons items and monsters. Never once do I feel myself being overly powerful against monsters. Many fights feel truly titanic and require patience. Wonderful time playing with friends.However not for those who dislike the grind. Not a game where you can passively faceroll everything like in some ARPG games. You will never be able to just facetank everything. So if these 2 factors are a turn off do not play this.
1;Very addicting game. Playing the franchise since day one. Only downside on the PC version is the lack of content. Ca$com holds back updates and gives them to consoles first. If we get the update eventualy then they adjust the loottable so you are forced to grind the event next time again only to farm the stuff you really wanted.Apart from that the game is pretty solid lots of grinding (it's MH duh!). No toxic MP.Hope to see better updates cycles for new content in the future.
1;Good Different and fun playstyles Can approach each fight many different ways Cool and unique monsters (except ing Lavasioth)Bad A bit grindyOverall it is a very fun game. You can play alone or take on the monsters with up to 4 friends. Best to play with 4 as the monster auto scales up to 4 people when on co op. 8/10
1;I have played previous MH games and this is easily the best. They have scrapped the weird quirks of the old games and I don't miss them one bit. Everthing is more fluid and the constant updates adding new monsters/ harder fights keep the game feeling fresh and challenging.
1;Absolutely amazing stays true to the previous titles of Monster Hunter Hunt make new gear hunt again. This game isn't for everyone some could see this as another arduous grind game but some people do certainly like it. I for one am not a fan of grindy games but thats due to the mindlessly numbing way to grind in other games but in this one their is a lot to keep your mind on so it doesn't feel mindless. I recommend this game for almost anyone who like's PVE content in other MMORPG's.
1;Great game but some major issues ( constant dc cpu overhead and occasional stuttering ) must be fix before I can recommend this game to everyone. Edit After the 6 Sep patch the dc issue is still not completely solve.Edit Server is more or less stable now.
1;Would be nice if you didn't have to start the cutscenes alone. Right now you have to watch cutscene singleplayer mode if playing story THEN have to go back and invite friends to join you. Not a good solution for a multiplayer game.Biggest bummer Losing connections to the MHW Servers. Unless the server problems are fixed this game gets a review.
1;It's rare to find complete awesome games that entertain you for hundreds of hours without getting bored and offer always something new.This game is just awesome both alone or with friends you'll have a blast.It has a typical Japanese approach to lobbies and UI design and for people who played something like Lost Planet 2 or Xenoblade Chronicles it will be kind of familiar. It's one of the best purchase of 2018 along with RDR2. A must have.
1;167 hours played.I m x hunter. Really a good game.Hopefully more maps &amp monsters added in future.Even I facing few prob like swap GPU happen fatal error 12 but still able to solved it.compare to console i more prefer PC which able to fully utilized with more powerful hardware.
1;I'm always looking for people to play this game with. Monster Hunter is a series that gives me a lot of joy and being able to play it with friends is a consistent joy. My friend got this game for me several months ago so I should probably mark this review as getting it for free but I don't think it applies to me. Anyway I really love this game it'd be cool to see more crossover content in future. Especially if its final fantasy themed.
1;I have played Monster Hunter since the first Generation (Playstation 2).Payed this game at full price and then the next month it sale what the ... but it's Ok.This game was good enough but Capcom must do something different than new monster map or colaboration.We hope to face all the monster from past or last generation of Monster Hunter.
1;Satisfying learning curve beautifully crafted environment kinda easy to learn hard to master. Best played with friends up to 3 people.Game still getting updated with new events and quest every now and then.A little grind but worth it when you realized how stronger you've gotten.Recommended!
1;As a veteran MH player since MHFU I have to say that this game is confusing at first getting used to the new mechanics and everything else but the overall user experience is very good despite the fact that I have to play at low settings/30fps which I don't actually mind. That works. Anyway I hope you guys decide to buy and enjoy the game as much as I did.
1;I think a problem recently if add a pattern to blame the new hunting may be better to play some such as allows players to play the monster other players play hunter for players to two sided confrontation so hunting monsters more wise and monster ecological will be more real let you experience the different monster hunter. What do you think
1;Ok I have over 200 hours on this game it will eventually get old untill they add something new like armor or monsters wich they do almost every month Then you discover how to mod the game and make DODOGAMA THE SIZE OF GODZILLA I highly reccomend this game for anyone the begginging is slow but the endgame is 100% worth it I reccomend playing with friends and for anyone who dosent know you CAPTURE DODOGAMA NOT KILL you will see why.
1;Monster Hunter for casuals. Still a good game but is missing much of the charm of previous games. New players will likely enjoy it but vets will find it lacking. Weapon and armor designs are bland compared to past games. There are 31 unique large monsters. I consider it to be easier than Dark Souls 3 but harder than most games. I'd reccomend buying on sale or wait for a Iceborne if you're on a really tight budget.
1;Grabbed 3 copies for my wife my friend and I to delve into the world of Monster hunter...world!So far it's pretty fun! The controls take some getting used to. The sound visuals are nice and the monsters are HUGE! The Steam controller has some issues losing its bindings and big picture mode has crashed a few times so far. Other than that I would reccomend this game!
1;Game works well and online is stable. I've never played a monster hunter game before this one but it was easy to pick up and learn. All the different types of weapons feel different and there is no bad choice for a weapon type. My only gripe worth mentioning is that this version is significantly behind the console version thanks to a later release date. If that doesn't bother you though definitely worth giving this a shot.
1;Fantastic challenging game. Plays like a fighting game with tons of end game rewards to chase down. Best experienced with 2 3 friends so you can party up and chat while you hunt. Requires effort to get into it and sadly requires a ton of options/keybinding editing to be even playable. But very fun once you've put 1 hr into setting it up and 10/15 hours into learning the game and systems.
1;I didn't think I'd like a game like this. Grinding and beating up the same monsters over and over again isn't something I normally can tolerate. However the game is GORGEOUS with a beautiful soundtrack. It's extremely fun to play with friends and while I got frustrated without new I was to the mechanics which require a bit of finesse. Luckily there's a lot of videos and such out there to help with getting to top form.There's a weapon for everyone.
1;"""These reviews rating it negative for connectivity issues that is basically just reconnecting once and it working don't really add up to much. This game is a lot better than this """"mixed"""" review it's getting for it's very minimal connection issuesMost of the gripes I still see about the game seem overall nonexistent for the majority"""
1;One of the best combat systems to date extremely hard to master and easy to learn for mostly everyone.Crappiest writing for quest but with the right mods you can get rid of the ever annoying Handler.Online got fixed a long time ago but there are still occasional glitches.Graphics is good with the occasional Teostra dropping the framerate under 40fps from stable 60.
1;Grindy but a overall fun game. if you enjoy challenges then this is the game for you the game provides the needs to help you just needs you to figure it out. Monster adapt which gives the game a new sense of style not many games have adapting bosses or creatures and also requires you to learn new strategies.
1;Absolutely great game of all time dont let negative comment confuse u now the game was stable connection great graphic great gameplay team up with your friend make this game really fun lolso many update!! never bored of this game see how long i play this game and still playing )))
1;Beyond the clusterf*cked UI the quality of life changes added in this game from the previous Monster Hunter series surely deserves a thumbs up.One just needs to get used to the controls (PC) and to master the movesets of your hunter and the monsters you hunt to get the best experience in this game.
1;It's great. I've always been into the Monster Hunter series so I may be biased though. It's the first time they've ever expanded to the PC so at least at the beginning there were a few problems. Thankfully they listened and fixed most of those problems. An expansion is also coming out next year (hopefully also for the PC) and I am very excited for that.
1;Really fun to get disconnected Error Codes 50051 MW1WHAT ARE YOU DOIN DEVEDIT yeaa the error didn't show up even i play 10hours straight. probably the error will occur when ur still in lower rank because many of my friends having the same issue in lower rank but not in higher rank. yep its not hard to go to higher rank but it takes times to achive it D
1;Do you like over the top anime styled attacks? Do you like dragons? Do you like various styles of complex and deep combat? Do you like cats? Do you mind a game consuming your very fibre of your being and existence?If you like any of these give Mo Han a shot. I've loved the series for many years and World is the easiest to introduce to new players and it solves so many quality of life problems that the series has had for some time. Do it. Behemoth beckons you.Plus free content! Lets hunt!
1;I like the game alot and had fun with friends but the grinding sometimes gets on your nerves but if you think about buying this game i highly suggest that you because its fun and you can put lots of hours into this game and still enjoy it at much you did in the beginning.
1;Product received for free. I LOVE THIS GAME ! It is he best game i have played this year. the graphics are just amazing and beautiful the fighting is awesome the game is not easy . you literall have to practice to make it in this game . it gives me a challenge.Its also cool you can play with friends. This game has some of the best customizable character stuff i have ever seen.
1;&gt Play MHW and use the gun people talk about&gt Get used to it and want the sexy upgrades&gt Farms for a few hours gets what I need and I am done with&gt Realise I need 2 Tziti Ya Ku claws&gt No biggie just do mission and smack him silly&gt Try atleast 4 times get no claw&gt It's fine ill get one this mission&gt Try another few times get mad and switch weapons.11/10 wouldn't grind again.
1;It's super good. I'm really surprised at how fast we are getting the updates. With that said disconnect issues still occur but vary few and far in between. It comes as a shock since it runs so well 99% of the time. The updates have made my computer run it even better now that I can turn off motion blur. I was able to crank textures up to max and run real smooth.Great game. Since it's on sale at the time of this review get it. I paid full price and I have no regrets.
1;Honestly speaking this game is great but it's also like training wheels for the rest of the MH series as if you get too used to the quality of life changes you'll have a hard time adjusting to the other games. Besides the things mentioned previously I've dumped a good amount of time into this game as well as on the PS4 version of the game and I hope the future games continue in this direction.
1;Great entry for the newcomers of Monster Hunter series. Smooth difficulty curves and great equipment progression system that kept players hook to the game. However the online session still feel clunky when searching for friend session but it's working fine when joined in.
1;I have always loved the Monster Hunter series. So glad it came to PC. This game tops all others by far. The only draw back I find is that there is less monsters so far than other games had but they plan on big expanions (So I have read) so I can't wait to see what they bring.
1;If you didn't get the feeling of rage quitting even once at any point of this game...you played it wrong.a living breathing world.in this day and age where AAA studios just rip off gamers and run away with their $$$ this is a money well spent.10/10 game for me. Highly Recommended.
1;It's a good small scale multi player game. Difficulty increases take time to adjust for because at times it's really steep.The gear sets leave much to be desired and in my opinion they haven't been thought through. The game plays well and is very well put together.Worth picking up for under 18 if you can find it on sale.
1;The only thing stopping this game from being a shining recommendation is the awful story that gets violently shoved down your throat for a good 10 to 20 hours of your playtime. This game is like being sodomized by Mickey Mouse for a few hours before you're allowed to enter Disney World. Maybe Disney World is awesome but I guess I'll never know. I was too busy thinking about Capcom forcing themselves inside me to notice.
1;It is not the monster hunter I know but it is closer and better then nothing still a good game worth the price they will update it for free adding to its shallow monster pool over time and that is good valueMake sure you install the Hex deco mod tho the drop rates of decos is weighted terribly and Hex deco mod will make them more fair
1;I love this game and it is one of my favorite Monster Hunter games in the series so far. Beautiful graphics and i love that you can eat meals and access your box at camp! D . Definitely would recommend! My only real complaint is the very limited amount of different monsters to hunt
1;A very good Monster Hunter game for people who are new to the franchise and very forgiving for new players. Although the story was pretty lackluster the game mechanics and visuals felt fluid and very promising. I can't wait until Iceborn is released so I can buy the expansion immediatly.
1;I haven't gotten this sucked into a game in quite a while I'd say it's well worth the price even at full price if you know it's the type of game you'd enjoy and don't want to wait for a sale. I bought the game earlier this month and already have 374 hours in it lol. I ing love Dark Souls 3 and some of the gameplay similarities are a large part of what drew me to this game.I haven't encountered any bugs thusfar and have only had a few connection issues too few to be concerned about.
1;The monster hunter series has been my all time favorite series since Monster Hunter Tri for Wii. Yeah it gets grindy at the end but nothing beats the thrill of wacking unreal monsters with a big sword! I think there's something for everyone to enjoy in this game with 14 differnet weapons to master and play with. Easy to play and hard to master I believe Monster Hunter is one of the greatest franchises to exist. Free updates and no pay to win content makes it all the more great!
1;While not best optimized game (thanks to its old engine) and some out of date choices for the games design it s still fun to play with a friend or 3. MHW is also a game about grinding new weapons and gear so if you don t like grindy games I can t recommend it + this game shows no mercy when you fight a monster.A few things to remember is that you need a beefy PC if you want to run above 1080p and a 6 or 8 core CPU.8/10
1;With over 200 hours into the game I can safely say that I am happy with my purchase even though the beginning was a little rough. It was constant fun trying to figure how to use each weapon and defeat each monster. The game kept challenging you with each new monster you found and had to fight especially the Elder Dragons beware of the nerg. Overall great game and very fun to play with a group of friends.
1;As of writing this the new xpac isint out yet however I think I have enough hours to say that this game is great. Lowkey grinding but the gameplay is solid and never ceases to bore or chore me (except deviljho). The game has no big issues other then some hitbox issues but other then that if you like killing and eating/wearing monsters then the best game for you is this one.
1;its not the monsters that are being hunted.. its the monsters doing the hunting )BUT!deviljoh... he's a massive t rex basically whos hitbox is an entire area and nothing at the same time depending if hes attacking you or your attacking himhes apparently meant to keep fighting when wounded but this runs across entire maps barely even fightingbroken monster&amp there are alot of people who play this and join your Sessions and hunts and cannot play for their life
1;+Challenging+Fun with friends+Good Graphic+Gameplay+Free DLC+Unique Collaboration Experience+50hr+ contents+Keep updating+finally 29 9 support+Master Rank coming soon The armor isnt as good looking as previous MH minor problem after alt tab the game Failed to join quest Story RNG Grind
1;Product received for free. I played around 300 hours on the PS4 and hundreds upon hundreds on the previous titles. I absolutely adore the MH series and this game is no exception. There are a great many things better and worse than in previous titles but this one is by far the most polished and easiest to get into compared to the other titles. If you love grinding and doing what is pretty much a series of boss fights then I say go for it.
1;Great Monster Hunter game as always. Released with some bugs but they will get fixed very soon. Dont be afraid do play this game for 15+ hours Monster has alaways been hard to start. If you are an beginner to the series give it a try with at least 15+ hours otherwise you wont see how the game really is.
1;"""I've been playing every single Monster Hunter game since """"Monster Hunter Freedom"""" for PSP and not a single one was even remotely bad.Monster Hunter World is another very good game with lots of changes to make the game even better.Watch a video / stream and see if this type of game is for you if it is definitely give this one a try."""
1;If you're into grinding and farming then this game is for you. This is the best monster hunter game mechanics wise though still lacks contents. I wish Icebourn would solve that problem. It's totally addictive and fun to play if you have the patience9/10 recommended
1;Pretty fun game. It's a bit grindy at some points but no worse than some other games I've played. At the moment I have 75 hours in game and I've crashed twice. Not a terrible ratio but a little frustrating when it occurs. There's a modding community that makes some nice convenience of life mods. I reccomend the Soverign Light Pillars mod for anyone new so you can see all the Monster Break parts. They can be kinda hard to see but with the mod it adds light pillars to them for easy spotting.
1;This game usually find its home on nintendo consoles I am happy this exists for other consoles and pc. While the usual monster hunter games have things that i prefer than in world I am happy with world and what it has over the nintendo ones. Somewhere between monster hunter games like generations ultimate and world is the perfect monster hunter.
1;good game two legged cats with mallets they speak dragons combat loot so much loot. graphics are awesome multiplayer option is amazing. need more stable connection in some of the multiplayer instances but thats about it get the game if you like two legged speaking cats with giant mallets.
1;No ultrawide 21 9 Support. Game needs to reset if you want to change the resolution. Xbox one controller stopped functioning after few game reboots. Last but not least... DENUVO.Good job.Now after months they added the 21 9 and many features.. well thanks! finally
1;Definitely not the game for everyone but I can say with confident that this is one of the best game I have played so far. Every fight is a thrille. The story may not be the best but the gameplay is god damn good. Lots of free content keep getting given out make me probably can never see the sun again.
1;Product received for free. Hated the DS versions of this game. Never thought I would like this one. So glad I got into it now. Super fun very challenging BUT very rewarding and very satisfying.Will purchase as a gift for friends.This game was gifted to my by friends.
1;Being new to MH series gave me unsettling moments while playing the game but every since i learned how to play it correctly you'll just keep on exterminating those monster for materials and creating weapons armors to your liking &lt 3Overall satisfied
1;This game is awesome. There are so many thinks you can do to improve your character and skills.The game is challenging and addictive.The only bad thing that i have experienced are a lot of network problems.At least Capcom is trying to fix those.(Sorry for my bad englisch D )
1;It is my first seris of the monster hunter game and had some worries before buying this game. As soon as i hunted a first boss monster my worries were already gone and a special feeling excited me which the game industry nowadays have been failing to make me feel that way. This game is a must buy game if you want to feel becoming better overcome difficulties and great achivement.
1;This was everything i wanted in a Monster Hunter port to the PC. Some of the more annoying grind mechanics (gathering fishing etc) have been streamlined and the combat is as complex and rewarding as i remember from the PSP days. Be aware the first hour of game play is positively the longest and most drawn out tutorial in existence but push through the first three Hunter ranks and you'll be golden. 10/10 would spend 2 hours designing my perfect cat fren again.
1;Game is absolutely great! Ultra wide screen support should not be a problem at 2018 but somehow it is. Fix that and we have real jewel here (and also a positive review)Edit 22.1.2019 Ultra wide support is here! Can't really complain about anything else )
1;There's nothing quite like dc'ing from every single mission nor with horrible pc optimization where it doesn't use my gpu at all and instead uses 100% of my cpu. Nice to see capcom learn from their mistakes like mvcu who would've thought technical issues can kill a game?Edit Game still isn't optimized but it is a lot of fun with friends.
1;Great community. Fun both single player and with friends. Beginning mid and end game are all great. There's always something to grind for. Having said that while the grind can get a bit tedious at the time you'll never want to resort to multi tasking on your second monitor to keep you entertained while you grind. The only other downside is occasional random DC's.
1;"""The game is pefect. Good graphics sound and monster designs.There is one glaring problem... the freakin' handler! I swear Capcom created her just to annoy the player. Constantly nagging taking credit and yelling """"PARTNER.""""I would happily buy a DLC that omits her from the game. 100/10 Game of The Year 2018"""
1;This is my first Monster Hunter experience I've been missing out! It's a great game played solo or with others. The environments are well done and enjoyable to travel through. Every fight feels just challenging enough to keep the game engaging and there are plenty of strategies to try out so combat never feels stale.
1;"""It was a rough launch(did you ever heard of """"For Honor""""?) but finally stable for multiplayer experience. I understand why so many people are mad because we have to wait more than half a year for this port and they even said it takes time to make something right(which it isn't) but now we have it the first and only MH on PC. The game is great even for single play/solo and now multiplayer are working(*but mind the out date/old fashion lobby though)."""
1;Good game you get to explode things with bombs and explosives. Sleep best thing ever.EDIT Also having the ability to kill your friends when they first start playing the game. I've done that and it felt great because he ran headfirst into the barrel bomb and boom.
1;A game about hunting monsters. When you first start out every monster scares you. By the end of it YOU are the monster. Single player is pretty vanilla but the co op makes it enjoyable. The real fun begins once you reach the endgame. There is grind but it's the fun type of grind because you're helping other people and being awesome.Pro tip for new players Don't attack monsters with your face.
1;With the added 21 9 support the game looks great on my monitor! A very fun game with countless ways to play and many hours of fun to be had. It can get a bit repetitive after a while but any game you can sink over 100 hours into for the price of a normal game is worth it in my book.
1;This was my first Monster Hunter experience and I had a great time.Beware the game can be a bit challeging at first but nothing a bit of practice cant solve.This game has the perfect formula to keep you playing over and over despite fighting the same monsters. Lots of weapons to pick different biomes fighting against multiple monsters and many other variables will make every hunt a new experience.Monster Hunter has a fame on its own and if you dont know why you should try this game.
1;You hit a chicken which armor isn't even good You make the chicken's weapon and it isn't even good Fight a spiked thing and it one shots you Make the armor and you can one shot the chicken Then you get one shot by a fire lion Armor doesn't helpWriting this I have no idea where I was going. Nor do I know what I'm doing still playing this game.
1;Yeah it's worth the money. If you're really interested watch videos on the mechanics of the game b/c there is a learning curve to this game and 1 review can't help you out with that curve. Watch youtube videos on each weapon and pick a cool one.I started with Sword and Shield then pretty much used every other shield type weapon and I've been loving Charge Blade recently
1;I honestly like all the Monster Hunter games since it was in the psp console. This Monster Hunter World really has cool mechanics added on it and the way it fights it's just so good. More monsters and collaborations on future would make this game very very exciting and interesting. I highly recommend this game for people out there thinking if this game is worth buying the answer ia YES. Get it and try Hunters
1;A fine addition to the Monster Hunter franchise. The visuals are wonderful and the gameplay is solid. My only complaints were the connectivity issues when the game first released but those have since been resolved. Also there seems to be a lack of monster variety but that should be solved with the upcoming expansion. 9/10 would recommend!
1;"""Monster Hunter at its finest. Currently one of the only games I """"go back to"""" from time to time for events and for good reason. This game is worth every penny especially considering all the AAA/microtransaction issues that the gaming industry is facing right now. One of the few franchises that still give us hope for an honest gaming era.10/10 HR999 here I come"""
1;amazing game. defineatly one of my favorites if not my favorite. outstanding graphics and a good challange. I just wish it was less expensive and had a few more big randomised fights. (this last part is a half joke) anyone who says its too bad because it is too hard is a pleb. Edit this game still great could use some more attention and all the arch tempered. i really wanna fight arch xeno and zorah. AqUa
1;Very addictive. The mechanics are super fun and the grind doesn't feel unbearable. Have had no trouble with multiplayer. Sometimes I'll lose my online session if I alt tab but I'm just careful not to do that while I'm actually on a quest with other people so it's a non issue.
1;I love the game. Played about 150 hours on Xbox when it was initially released. And recently started again on PC mainly because it loads a lot faster with the SSD. I will say that Xbox online session seems to more stable I have only drop once during mission in months. Where on steam I been disconnected during mission once a week. Oh It's not that I got booted as in these cases the monster and other players usually freeze for 30 seconds before I got disconnect.
1;I love this game grab some friends though it can be a slog to play solo. its grindy but its that fun grind. you really get the sense that your working towards a bigger goal and when you accomplish that goal (killing a monster you've been struggling with finally getting your armor and stats exactly the way you want them) the payoff feels immeasurably good.
1;Guys I don't care how tough you think you are nothing hit harder than life.But it ain't about how hard you hit its about how hard you can GET hit and keep moving forward OK?And don't be pointing fingers saying I'm missing out hp regen on my weapon cowards do that and that ain't you!https //www.youtube.com/watch?v NF651F2WBzY
1;This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced it's intelligent it gives freedom to your epic adventure and last but not least this game doesn't have any loot box and micro transaction nonsense!Great work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!
1;9.8/10 hands down I may give it a 10 but have yet to get to play the full version. However This game is amazing I love all the tactical strategies that you can make depending on party make up and types of magic used. This game truely incorporates individual choice in play style which is great for team building and the Dungeon creation is sure to give me many more hours of game time after I complete the main story.
1;Amazing game with great attention to detail that rewards exploration. Multiple ways to progress and no handholding.Best RPG out there in my opinion. Just some minor bugs here and there so far but nothing game breaking. 9/10 10 when the bugs get fixed.
1;damn I grew up with this kind of RPG and I love it.spent way to many hours in games like never winter nights and pillars of eternity and I'm sure this game will devour them as well.although I spent only 2 5 hours in this game I'm sure this will be in my top list in a few weeks.Edit I hit the 206 hours mark and still going and most hours played in my list P DAMN I love this game
1;I played only arena (pvp) for a while but i can tell that Source points are OP having an option to play without them would be really nice. Camera needs some getting used to and they need to fix the chat because if its your turn and u start writting in the chat ur character starts to do weird things (keyboard shotcuts are still active). Other than that game runs very smoothly for EA game 60fps without any problems on ultra. Will update this when i find more to say about it.
1;10 out of 10!!!!!! This is a great RPG. I highly recomend this game to anyone looking for a new RPG. Divinity has a good story action magic and game play that actually makes you get involved with the game to solve puzzles/mysteries/winning intense combat when outnumbered. Looking forward to see what happens with the rest of the game!
1;Do you like customization?Do you like a good story?Do you like making your own story?Do you like challenges?Do you want to play the best RPG on the market?Then this game is for you! I've already put in 28 Hours and I've barely scratched the surface of the story.
1;mod installer simulator+basically you can do everything in this gameyou can be a character you likeyou can use your favourite weapon and drive badass car or plane or tank or a ing dinosaura lot of game mode_loading a lobby that you don't have their add on take time like forever and that add on will disappear in shortime later spend a lot of time to downloading add ongreat game so far10/10 would pay more time to download mod than actually play the game
1;Like building games? Get Garry's Mod.Like Roleplaying games? Get Garry's Mod.Like Zombie survival games? Get Garry's Mod.Like First person shooters? Get Garry's Mod.Like Racing games?

1;Garry's mod is a very fun game but there's only one problem. THE GOD DAMN LOADING. When you enter a game it takes about 3 to 5 minutes just to join a game sometimes. But there's sometimes where I get into a game quickly. But..... Thats my computer I have a gaming laptop not a PC if you have a PC it might work? But I think it depends on your WiFi
1;Prophunt? Murder? WHAT ARE THOSE I ONLY PLAY GMAD TAWER CAUSE OF YOOGSCAST THEY RUINED THE GAME BUTT IT HAS MINIGOLF AND I HAVE A STRANGE THING FOR MINIGOLF AND OMG IT'S SOOO COOL #LITTLEKID #YOOGSCOOST Bad review time Don't play gmod tower UCH play real UCH and be a man. Also play Mother 3 before playing UCH you scrubs.
1;I have played this game for so long and the thing that makes it so good is how closely integrated the workshop is with the game and how easy it is to use. Servers automatically download addons on peer to peer servers gamemodes can be designed by workshop creators and so can maps. That's why this game has been going ten years strong.The best game I've ever played.
1;"""Joined serverBecame Hobo KingStarted building mexican border admin helpedRecruited more hobosTook over the streetsGot arrestedCame out of jail and became a police officerMan comes up to me screams """"HELP OFFICER A DIRTY MEXICAN STOLE MY NUGGETS""""He takes me to their houseI get the guy to help me break inWe kill the man on sightAdmin calls us upBanned for 4 DaysHavent had a good laugh like this for agesBuy It now if you want to have some fun !"""
1;A fantastic game built upon the source engine that provides thousands upon thousands of hours of endless content and things to do through user modification and the steam workshop. The game is phenomenal and very fun to play with friends either on a private server making use of mods you and your buddies have downloaded or on matchmaking as they're are plenty of different game modes to play. The game is also incredibly fun on singleplayer through the endless amount of things you can do.
1;There's many things to do in Gmod Make funny/cool poses having NPCs fight each other downloading fun maps off of the workshop and just having overall fun. If you just wanna lay back and have a fun time get Gmod. However I'm not too much of a fan of TTT or Prop Hunt but that's just my opinion. I rate this game 8/10.
1;This is literally one of the best games that never get old nor get boring.Even with its half life 2 graphics its still a overwhemingly perfect game for when your bored or just want to make amazing contraptions! or you want to mess around and shoot a ton of random npc's like me v(dont believe me? Just play it yourself or watch other people play it i guarantee after a few hours of seeing what this game can offer you you might really want to try it out for yourself too v)
1;This game is clearly my favorite game it is amazing. I am into these 2D games like Terraria but this is just better than the other ones (like starbound which i also like). Don't listen to people who compare it to Minecraft because it is much much different!
1;This game brings some of my most creative side out and i'm pretty thankful for it since i like to get caught up in doing my own work. I tend to get carried away when i'm only doing a few houses and stuff The HUD may seem weird to some people but you tend to get used to that pretty quickly. You may seem lost on what to do but if you talk to the Guide (Right click him) He can give you advice that helps you out through out the entire game.
1;Want a game like minecraft in a 2D style with more bosses and tons of more item while still manitaining that crafting experience? This game is what you're looking for.I always pick this up every year and start a fresh character playing again and absolutely become addicted to it everytime. While the startup is slow (just like Minecraft mind you) when you start progressing through the game it really speeds up.
1;This game shows people what minecraft could be. Minecraft is a great sandbox game but has nothing beyond being sandbox. Terraria takes that gameplay style and gives it a story and sense of progression/goals. If you were interested in Minecraft at any point but stopped because you got bored this game is for you. Would recommend to anyone though adult or child (though if you're really bad at video games then you might have trouble completing it).
1;One of the best time wasters i can think of. There is so much to do in this game if you like crafting loot and killing bosses. there isnt much to do in the end game really unless you want to put restrictions on yourself to make the game tougher. 9/10 )Also they are always working on updates. this game has been out for quite a while but they are still adding new cool stuff!
1;Started by making a base in a tree. Got confused on what to do and dropped the game.A year or two later I open the game back up look up a guide start a new world and fought and died on my way to the wall of flesh then the three mechanical bosses then plantera then all the way to the solar pillars and fought against the moon lord and beat him first try with a lot of cheesing the game.Overall good game.Side note Duke Fishron.
1;Almost 300 hours and counting. If you are looking for a game to relax and enjoy alone or with friends then this will do it.Terraria take the feel of minecraft and puts it into a 2d platform. It also expands upon the build aspect by letting you create a home base and recruiting townsfolk. There are many different biomes with unquie monsters to fight both above ground and below.On top of all that the dev team has release so many updates that it is worth the full price let along a sale price.
1;This is a very fun game and I reccomend it very much. I've had such a fun time playing it and Terraria can be played by all ages the game isn't too violent and there is a Turn off blood option even without turning this off the blood is not very visible.
1;Let me just start out by saying that Terraria is one of the best games I have had the privledge to get my hands on. When I first started it I felt indifferent about the game and it seemed rather boring. But then I dipped my toe in a little deeper and a monster dragged me under until I was fully submerged in the most beautiful fun and exciting experience I have ever had. This game is amazing. 11/10
1;one of the best sandbox games out there D i love its style and its game play DIf you are a fan of 2D games this is a must play game Di enjoyed every hour played it and i still do D8/10 Fallen Approves!Update for 1.3This game never stops to amazes me!!The number of items added and the overall gameplay you can dump on this game is unbelivable!!!!!
1;Ah... The one game refered to as a rival of Minecraft.... How much I LOVE this game. Weither its from the hundreds of items and mobs to find or the thousands of things to build its great. I honestly can't express how many hours I've had fun on this game solo or with friends. I 100% recomend this game!
1;If you are a grown up person and value something more than graphics in a game definetly pick this. The amount of fun solo/coop content this game have is astounding. If you already played years ago there's always a lot of new challenging stuff when you come back.
1;This Game is very good!Its very balanced between fighting exploring and building!Because of the huge amount of possibilities (e.g. Class Playthrough Multiplayer Going Derp Mode Building big and Synergie tests) I am never getting tired of this game.For 10$/ (even less if you wait for steam sale) this game is totally worth to buy!It also updates alot giving alot of new content on each update!
1;If 2D doesn't turn you off this is more than worth the price. Ontop of that it's on 60 75% sales quite often.Really no reason not to own it unless this is totally not your cup of tea.Not much more to say. Everything it does it does well. Great example of how game development developers should be. This was a great game when it came out and there have been so many free content updates adding over 2 3 times what was in the base game.9.5/10 0.5 for the dungeon gaurdions when you play hardcore )
1;This game is insanely unique interesting and your possibilities are unlimited! It may not be focused on building but heck it does it well. Even though im talking about building there is much more. All the bosses are creative! Everything about them! As well as the weapons. And if you are a bit stuck you can always search youtube or the terraria wiki. Honestly this is literally the best game i played in my life.11/10
1;I like this game. It's the next best thing to Minecraft but cheaper better and more. Loads of bosses and enemies to fight swords and tools to craft massive terrain to explore there's so much to do. It will take a very long time until you get bored because it's the best game ever. D
1;This is an awesome game that brings out a person's creativity! The only limit is your imagnation (and the size of the world that you have chosen).I highly recommend this game to anyone who seeks adventure likes to fight zombies (&amp some awesome bosses) and has a need to build amazing things. Just when you think you have unlocked every secret in the game you find a new one!
1;I've had dozens of hours on this title and I do have to say Terraria never gets old. Never.I have played this since around 1.1 and I've been a devoted fan since then. And with time this game can only get better.Best played with a group of friends you would be surprised what a group of idiots and dynamite can do.
1;Been playing Terraria for years now both alone and with my little brother. Together we've probably banked roughly 1500 hours. Challenging exciting addictive and super re playable. I've made hundreds of worlds and every time I do it's just as fun as the first time. We can't wait for the next installation from Re Logic! I absolutely recommend this game to everyone and their grammy.
1;An Incredible game Its addicting becuase theres allways something to look forward too and your allways eagar to explore the world Definetley reccomended for anyone looking for a cheap game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun And that passes the time.
1;This game is NOT a minecraft ripoff it actually came first! Go ahead and check anyways this game is soooooo much better. More weapons armor bosses and litterally everything else. This game is just better and its cheaper too! And that dosent mean it loses quality far from it! Sure minecraft is 3 D but terraria is better with 2 D. Can you imagine 3 D terraria I cant. So I say get the game!
1;The new districts civics and revamped wonder system are great additions to this wonderful franchise. My only complaint is that Firaxis needs to iron out the various bugs and problems that have been here since launch.Final Verdict It's a really good game but if you can stand to wait you could wait till they fix the issues before you buy.
1;The game is very nice I had to get used to the new interface but the district system is absolutely fantastic in my opinion.Religion victories are a bit hard in this game though and they should lower the infantry production cost or make their strenght slightly better because right now AT Crew has the same strenght is cheaper to produce and has a bonus versus horses. I would give this game a 8.5/10
1;Going from Civ 5 to Civ 6 is like upgrading to the new iPhone you essentially get the same thing couple of cool new features better looking design but a hefty price tag to wrap it all upHowever any Civ fan should definately give this a go but any new players should get Civ 5 to try out for a much cheaper price
1;This is something of a change form the older civ titles. For the most part it works out very nicely. The're some roughness around the edges but I think in a short amount of time these will be addressed. With some dlc and expansions the game could be some thing special in the civ universe. Some of the new features make great additions. I have been trying to play civ v and civ vi and I keep noticing that I prefer Civ VI even though V is a much more complete game.
1;After 1000 hours of Civ5 I've been waiting for this eagerly since it was announced. I played my first game on Prince and used it to learn some of the new mechanics but never felt sufficiently challenged by the AI so I cranked it up to King for my second match. My empire was all rubble from Brazil's conquering army within the first 50 turns T_T10/10 Would become enslaved by Pedro again (and probably will).
1;Brilliant. Feels like there is even more going on than in civ 5. Uses tile improvements by builders aswell as a new district system to unlock specialised buildings.Cultural advances are researched just like science. In mid late game you can bundle units together into a corps (2) or an army (3).When you level culture up high enough you can change your government and use cards based on your cultural research to aim your civ at specific improvements.
1;Another excellent entry in the Civ series. The addition of Districs to Cities make the city management and planning aspects of the game more interesting.Religion is now more enjoyable to persue as a victory condition.Entire game has gorgeous graphics throughout..
1;It takes some getting used to as its a completely new format compared to Civ V once youve played a few hours though you start getting used to all the new functions gfx seemed a bit cartoony at first but if you look closer theres far more detail than previous games all in all a really good game but does take some getting used to if you're an old school player like me )
1;"""It's drug totally drug. If your boss teachers or parrents were able to keep you from any of the series of Sid Meier's Civilization please you should listen to them. Once you unfortunately touch it even the God couldn't stop your clicking on """"next turn""""...Love yourself Enjoy the life and let you and Civilization stay isolated..."""
1;i like the game its very smooth running even on windows 7 (it's designed to run on 10) the only problem ive found thus far is the other players declare war on you when all you are doing is trying your damndest not to get murdered when you get two barbarian encampments spawn right outside your gates! are Barbarians a city state ally of the AI players now? and if so why do they want to me over by pillaging me when ive not met a city state in this map yet!
1;At 22 00 Me Mom just one more turn!Mom Just don't stay up too late okay?At 24 00 Mom You are still here?!Me Just one more turn!3 00 in the next day Mom GO TO YOUR BED!!Me Just one more TURN!! pleaseAt 13 00 in the next day Mom YOU HA Me JUST ONE MORE TURN DAMN IT!...And I'm still here ._.
1;"""its a civilization game it stands up to the """"test of time"""" and once you start playing you want just 1 more turn just 5 more minutes before you know it its 4 am and you have work the next morning .. its addictive like every other civ game i have played before"""
1;I said I'd give Gilmore Girls a chance while I played this game. See why everyone liked it so much. Just something for background noise.I have now watched 8 seasons. And I don't even like Gilmore Girls. WHich can't be true I've atached all 8 seasons. Still haven't concured the world
1;Finally! The most important thing about this game has been implemented! Time to rename every city. Honestly the AI is very difficult to befriend (though possible) but I'd act the sameway if I were to start my own civ. The trust issues are real. Curently having fun playing alone and with friends.
1;Awesome game! Best release version of Civ in a long time. That being said game does feel incomplete at times. Small things like no world Congress or UN makes the game lack of a sense of cooperation with the AI when playing single player. However any small complaints with the game are sure to be resolved within a patch or expansion or two. Highly recommended.
1;It needs some work. The AI especially could use a lot of tweaking but overall it's a fanatstic launch and setup to be the best Civ game to date. The mechanics are similar to Civ 5 but different enough to take a couple games to figure out. If you're not enitrely sold I suggest waiting until a couple patches or expansion packs come out but if you're a hardcore civ or 4x fan it's absolutely worth diving into.
1;Civilization VI is a worthy installment in to the Civilization series. It launches with the most features of any of it's predecessors. The visuals are rather pleasing crisp warm and colourful. The gameplay is leaps and bounds over Civilization V. All in all a highly enjoyable game.
1;In time this will evolve into a great addition to the series as its predecessors have. Along the way expect to be nickel and dined to death. At least incremental improvements lessen the learning curve. I'm surprised they haven't added a unit screen in the latest update. Seems they rely on a mod to fill that gap while they attend to other priorities. All and all an addictive and expensive experience
1;I played two different civilations I found it a bit differcult at first to get the hang of the new set up from the creators but ultimately it was enjoyable and I woould play the game a couple of more times just stay away from Marathon if you don't have any patience or time to do it.Overall i would recommend this game to new players of this franchise
1;I am enjoying the game so far. I am happy that it didn't have the Civ Beyond Earth glitches!!! Firaxis has brought a few of the original aspects back from Civ 4 which were left out of Civ 5.... very nice touch for us Sid Meier followers!!! Integration of a 'card run' civil direction addess a diverse aspect to government management! As I have been playing Civilization franchise since 1993 this is the most engaging and indepth Civ to date! Well done Sid Meier!!!!
1;+Amenities &gt Happiness+No more wonderwhoring+Districts are neat (production district too valuable though)+Leader ability+Civ ability adds more versatility+Great people are more unique (specific abilties relating to what the person did in history) AI dumber than a bag of rocks UI poorly designedOverall very good
1;Innovative changes have been made throughout large areas of the game to create the best CIV launch experience we've ever seen. One can only imagine that with expansion packs they will continue this to create the definitive Civilization experience. It also seems like they have good community interaction and are addressing relevant issues fairly well on the community forums with representatives addressing individual issues with impressive regularity.
1;I'm still getting used to the new game mechanics but it's a definite step up from Civ V (and a massive improvement on Beyond Earth). My only real gripe is with the ever present and continually (and I mean *continually*) respawning barbarians which make the early game much harder than it needs to be and the later game more tedious in having to constantly deal with them over and over.
1;Great game. Best civ game ever on release. If you judge it by the last civs then it has about 1 and a halfs dlc content plus the base game on release already.The AI leaves things to be desired but i am confident that these issues will be addressed. For the base game the cheap price of $60 in store is a great deal i recommend it to everyone who loves an RTS and/or loved civ 5.
1;A solid step forward for the franchise in almost every way. Exciting improvements to many of the core systems make for the best gameplay experience in a Civ game. I don't like the cartoony leader aesthetic the confusing fog of war or the soporific music score but everything else is so good that I do recommend it to all fans of the series or genre. If you're new to Civilization or 4x games in general you should really check this one out.
1;The good The game is great.The bad The interface was designed by aliens in a serious step back from Civ 5. Many things that SHOULD be told via context pop ups must instead be read in the Civilopedia. Several factors affect e.g. build times but aren't explained in the Civilopedia at all.
1;This game is amazing I don't understand the hate. Sure it has it's quirks and the DLC is but the main game is a huge improvement over civ 5 graphics and gameplay wise. I highly reccomend to all fans of civ 5 but be warned it is a bit easier and there is no real good dlc right now. Either way playing with friends is great and I definitely think it is worth your money.
1;Love the new disrict systems and I know some dislike the new graphics but I actualy like the new art style. If anyone has ever played civ rev then Civ 6 is that but far better. The new civics tree and eurkea moments really make a big change from civ 5 in a really nice way.
1;Love this game always looking for new dlc and mods to improve an already great experience! With this said there are a fair few negative reviews coming in and I understand some of the frustrations. Hopefully issues such as stupid AI will continue to be tweaked and rebalanced. As a side note please makes forests have more trees!!!
1;It felt like an incomplete product on release but my most grevious complaint the lack of teams has since been corrected with a free patch. Plenty of DLC has come out to expand the factions and there are some great mods.There is however still an unfortunate lack of diverse maps compared to its predecessor. Overall it's good but leans a little more heavily on its modding community than Civ V.
1;Game is really good ..expect something completely different then civ 5...civ 6 will only get better...yes there is some stuff that still needs to be fixed..but they're doing a good job so far...at the beginning it was a train wreck...yes I would recommend buying it..the better your CPU...the better it plays and looks...Have a niice day... )..

1;Had a choice between this game and battlefield 1... ea...Very funny meme of a game lots of fun a lot better than 5Russia for lifefunny meme timemy friend and i decided to do a civ 1v1 with civs on europe.of course the decides to go england and russia's spawn was on the coast so rip meor was I???moved my setller back one tile and wiped out all of europe with warriors boi quitbest meme gameplz get much memays DAMN daniel
1;Loved this game until recent update. Something wrong with deals especially regarding luxury resources. Seems I can trade 1 orange for someones entire empire. While comical it defeats the purpose of the game. Still giving a thumbs up in hopes they fix the bug.
1;This game and all the others before it have been a great joy to me and a way to stay connected with my brother. I am very thankful for the timeless happiness it gives me even when my heart is near sorrowful to death with depression. Thank you all who have made Civ possible.
1;Civilization VI is an excellent game easily one of the deepest and most rewarding 4X experiences I have played. As with all Civ games however it does only a meagre amount to improve upon the previous iteration which could put off players with extensive time invested in Civ V. Recent updates have tweaked and improved systems to make the game more balanced and therefore enjoyable as a whole.
1;I don't see why everyone is throwing a fit over the Deluxe Edition. Mine has downloaded each of the packs for free as it was supposed to. It doesn't show up as purchased on the store page but it does in game. Really seems like people are over reacting before actually taking the time to look and see if they have it or not. This is a game company that is out to make a profit like any other company if don't like it than don't buy it least of all whine and cry like the ***** you are.
1;I can say that I'm really enjoying the game out of what I've played. Of course the hatred of multiple nationalities and nations is back but I mean it's Civ. The fact that Firaxis has managed to release a Civ game that isn't terrible upon release is an achievement in itself! The game also gets some free points for finally including Norway regardless of Norway more or less being not that great in this game.Overall yeah it's good. I like it.
1;One of the best entires in the series. Give it time to get patches mods and expansions like CIV5 and it'll be perfect.9/10Edit Revised after Rise&amp Fall. The game is one step closer to being it's best. The next DLC in February seems to promise that final step!
1;Definitely a good game. When you first get the game it is truly a blast. It takes a while but it might eventually get less enjoyable if you keep trying the same difficulty. At this point you can either challenge yourself with a harder difficulty start playing multiplayer or download mods. All of which can extend playability enourmously. With the announcement of the new DLC this could easily become the best civilization game in the series.
1;"""The main question in a thumbs up / down ratings system is """"Did I enjoy it and do I think others will?"""" Yes I am enjoying it.Its not perfect. It shares a number of problems that have always plagued the series (played since Civ II). But is it worth playing? Yes."""
1;Improving from civ 5 were a big task but with the expansion and hopefully the upcoming 2nd expansion they have done it. Civ 6 is in my humble oppinion the best the civ series have been yet.It takes some time to get used to the new way to upgrade cities but in the end its worth it.
1;Stoked the game is out have wasted more of my life in this series than any other game I think. Well perhaps WoW rivals it but I've played this series since the first release so there is a good chance I'm hooked more )Still digging this new version quite different from previous version but once you figure out how the AI is motivated you can make it work out. Glad I didn't win every game so far!
1;If you look through the honest reviews the only complaints about the game you'll see are about the AI. While the AI is certainly the weak spot of this game AI has never been Civilization's strong suit and people tend to not realize that writing a fair and balanced AI is incredibly difficult (hence why not even mods have been able to fix it in any Civ game.Civ VI has several other minor flaws to be sure but overall it's a very solid Civ game and a vast improvement over V.
1;The best core CIV game I have played and with this recent patch 95% of the issues I had have been resolved. I only hope to see more content and more balance as time goes on. Small note that online multiplayer still tends to be unstable and any desyncs connects or disconnects can cause the game to freeze up and not recover. Play online at your own risk and be prepared to put effort in staying with a group.
1;I don't agree with a lot of the negative reviews. I have realized that I am a more casula CIV gamer than a lot of others so perhaps I didn't notice the flaws of the game. The important thing is that I had fun playing this game and that is the only thing that matters.
1;SCORE 9.6/10This is the best Civilization yet and feels like it has already has a major expansion. It took everything good from IV and V and combined them with some new stuff like districts and honestly a gorgeous art style. I've played them all and this one is the best and will continue to add and improve for years!
1;Is it perfect? No. But this game has come a long way since release. To say this is a bad game would be totally wrong. It's a different experience than past Civ games but the core aspects are still there. It is definitely worth the money and there's a healthy mod comunity. Personally I wanted to hate the game for changing so much but honestly through all its flaws it's still very fun.
1;"""A good iteration on the Civilization formula with multiple paths to victory supporting a variety of play styles. The """"just one more turn"""" feel has been ramped up even in the end game now when things tend to slow down there's always a steady stream of micro goals to be planning and working toward."""
1;I'm a fan of the series and this one is clearly an evolved in the right way title. I enjoy the AI's levels and also it's aggressiveness.I still dream of a day where I can stack multiple unit types to for a proper army but I was happy with the triple stacks given.
1;This game by itself does not satisfy me at all. The steam workshop is the only thing keeping the game alive at this point. I really like Civ 6 when I have 50+ mods on. The sad thing is that I beleive some of the modders have more knowledge on what people would enjoy than the Civ 6 developers do.
1;"""These guys are incredible. At first I didn't like the game graphics are not to my liking and the new system of districts just seemed to make everything too """"different"""" so I went back to play Civ 5 instead. But after a while once you get the idea of the districts workers etc... you realise this is the ultimate Civ game now kudos to the creators! Still don't like the graphics but it's never been about graphics with this game )"""
1;I've been playing the Civilization series since Civ II. The need for micromanagement has dropped off in the last few games graphics have improved and I'm loving the ability to use community mods nowadays. The ability to customize my cities with districts now is SUPER cool.
1;Very different from Civ V but in a refreshing way. Builder charges are a really cool concept and I love the civic system vs the different paths in Civ V. The fog of war map thing is kind of weird but the visible map is beautiful. Districts and tile management spices up the micromanagement side and provides another way to obsess way too much about the optimal choice. Great game so far.
1;I like this game I really do. I would recommend people to get the dlc's and play with AI mods or friends cuz the base game AI needs a bit of improvement. My only regret about this game right now is that I play with to many mods and that I need to play more. Also it'd be great if we could get a minimap review at the end.
1;Honestly one of the best games I have ever played and I've played quite a few. It brings such a different exiting approach to games. Being a lover of Football and cars this is the perfect combination. Also great if you want a break from FPS games.Would highly recommend!
1;This has become one of my favorite video games of all time I have even more game time on Xbox than PC. The ceiling of skill is so high and the floor for a casual player to pick up and play is very low. Perfect game for anyone. If you haven't tried this game you should.
1;"""Rocket League is the sportiest sports game on the virtue of demanding nothing but personal player input and having a high skill ceiling but fair learning curve on top of being ball related. Game has six unique game modes and dozens more mutators for players to keep coming back to. Visual/audio design is fantastic and contributes to """"game feel"""" for lack of a better phrase making scoring a goal never stop feeling good."""
1;Hello I have a problem ... I have 2 accounts in rocket league. So i got a ban on one of them for 7 days for bad words (yes I agree I'm wrong here and it right) but then decided to change my account to play so i got my second account. played a little but decided to go back. When I started the game on the main account I found out that all of my items were disappeared. Pls help me. Thx .
1;It's football with cars! and rockets and sometimes explosions! A brilliant little pick up and play that's easy to get on with nigh on impossible to master 5 minutes of fune that never really stops being fun over and over and over. I really can't recommend this enough!
1;I really like the concept of the game and how so there are many varieties of moves and tricks you can attempt in the game. I also really like the constant updates of new maps crates and maybe even gamemodes and how it just makes the game more and more unique. 5 Star Rating everyday of the week.
1;Hit the ball hit the ball hit the ball HIT THE BALL!!! Who cares where its going to go (every PlayStation player)But seriously though this game is amazing to play with friends or by yourself and I could not recommend any online only game more then this one.
1;This game takes first place when it comes to hour count on any game in my steam Library and for a good reason. You see... Rocket League is easily the best money I have spent on a game. This game is not just a game its a sport. Something to be competitive about something to sink your time and hone your skills in. The DLC doesn't affect the gameplay it's just for funsies. The crate system is much like tf2 and csgo. Go PSY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;Rocket league is a fast and exciting game. I love that it combines flying cars with soccer I loved SARPBC and this does not disappoint. It might take you a while to become competitive (as do most games) but it's so worth it. Keep practicing and don't let your low rank or losing many games discourage you. We've all been there.
1;This game should end with a mandatory cool down phase where you look at something and are only then allowed to pilot a vehicle after you are no longer a menace to society.Fun game you'll never be as good as in the clips you see on those video sites. But get 1 3 buddies and you'll have a blast playing this.
1;"""Very funny game.quite hard to play it is very difficult to hit this giant ball.But i think 20 for the game might be a bit much. Thy have to release some more features then it is awesome.So to summarise in a nutshell this game is great gameplay is great graphic is great but it is just"""" football with cars.so in my opinion cause of the great fun factor 8/10"""
1;One of the greatest sports video games ever created.Easy to get into difficult to master.Low price and years later it continues to get new free content.Highly recommend it!Update Years later and still playing.New content is regularly added for FREE and the game is still wonderful.Rocket League is awesome!
1;This game is awesome. HOWEVER I've found that you must get just slightly better at it before it really becomes fun. What you see the pros do is a TON harder than it looks. I put about 20 hours in just playing with my friends occasionally but not really enjoying it. As soon as I started to understand some of the more complex mechanics I fell in love with the game. Great game 10/10. But first u must git gud.
1;This game is amazing combines one of the few most famous kinds of games racing and soccer and even better they added Boosts it is amazingly fun and I definitely recommend to buy this game worth $20? Definitely You can fly around the map with the boosts too D ALSO KILL PEOPLE WITH THEME MEMEMEMEMEMEE
1;Easy to play hard to master. A ton of casual gamemodes too for those concerned with not wanting to be too competative. Whilst the ranked games test your ability and help you to improve. Rocket League has come a long way and long may it's journey continue!
1;This game is actually pretty fun when you're winning and playing with your friends. And nothing beats the thrill of slamming in a difficult goal. But I'll be damned if this game doesn't have one of the most toxic communities I've seen it rivals CS GO sometimes. Other than that though I definitely recommend.Edit I hate this game now
1;A great game that doesn't get old both casual and competitive people can enjoy this game the only negative thing that i can say is that sometimes the servers are a little bit wonky it can be frustrating to watch the ball teleporting right before your eyes but it isn't really that frequent to hinder the experience.
1;Probably one of the most fun games i played with friends. still fun by yourself though.the main issue is with the servers and the fact they copied fortnite with the rocket pass/ battle pass. It is a good aspect market wise but the game was unique. i give this game a 9/10 with friends.
1;Product received for free. Rocket League is The Best game that i ever played i recommend this game for people who love to watch soccer also this game can teach a lot about mechanics . The most important thing about this game that you will not be angry make sure that you will enjoy this game and check the website as well . https //www.rocketleague.com/news/
1;"""Great game with some amazing content for the competative side of players out there. You will start out being amazed at the arial acrobatics happening around you in game then all of a sudden you are in Ranked match honing your skills against others players attempting to best you with skill speed witt and """" Demos """" . """" What a save!"""" Highly recommend and encourage you to give it a try if you are on the fence about this one."""
1;"""Even after almost 350 hours this game still gets me intrigued to play. The amount of time and effort this game takes to even consider """"good"""" is a lot. Now I switched from Xbox to PC with rocket league and I have around 700 hours and I can't believe how many new ways I discover how to score a goal. It feels amazing yet frustrating that I can't be as good as I know I can."""
1;It has got nice cars nice graphics action different modes. You can play it competitively or just for fun. I recommend playing it with friends that way it's much more fun than playing alone! This game combines muscle cars and soccer if that sounds good to you get the game!
1;Everyone should play this game. Kids should be encouraged to play this game over shooters etc. Easy to play difficult to master ridiculously entertaining to play and watch. Genuinely the best game ever made in my view. Psyonix run it really well. Regular free updates and quality paid DLC. Worth every penny and will never be outdated. Oh and RLCS is brilliant too. So much fun.
1;i've been playin gthis game for 3 years and still there's so much to do.ok so it's easy to play hard to master type of game where it have alot stuff you need to learn to master the game and don't mention the brilliant idea this game has to offer and there's ranked for all those sweety people out there and there's different modes to the game that makes the game so good finally i highly recommend the game to the people that don't have it yet (
1;was my favorite game ever even if the competitive got challenging. With the new rubberbanding update i would not recomend any download this game. even if it was free. unplayable just a giant headache at this point. will update if it gets fixed Seems to have been fixed. recommened whole heartedly
1;This game is great and I reccomend it to everyone. When you hear about it the concept seems dumb but it's actually great. This game is worth all the money I spent on it. I have over 1000 hours on this game across many platforms and I still love it. If you have enough money to buy this I would.
1;I personally really like this game as the skill cap is so high and there are always new mechanics being found. I have played over 2000 hours on ps4 and it is hard to get into at 1st but once you get to a level where you have the basics nailed it really starts to become enjoyable.
1;Rocket League is a team based action game which includes lots of stratigies along with great time with friends. Many intense games come with a very toxic community unlike rocket league which is a very welcoming and kind community. Rocket league is a community based game with community made maps abilities to upload workshop maps aswell. With a low system requirement makes it still playable on many budget computers and still the maps are very visually stunning.10/10 Recommended Game!
1;"""After 300 hours over 4 years I'm finally writing a review for one of my favorite games ever. For me this game is a source of endless fun and challenge. There's nothing more fun than grinding in ranked with one or two of friends or getting the whole gang to play some """"friendly"""" 3v3s.Devs are constantly putting work into the game and always running fun seasonal events.10/10 would boost again."""
1;. Some poeple might hate it because you have to work. But that's part of the fun! Yes I ranked up! Aww I lost but now I know what I have to work on to get better and rank up! (Not that simple but you get the picture) If you got $15 to spare wait for a sale and get it!
1;"""Great game easily the best $20 I've ever spent on a game. This game does the """"Easy to play Hard to master"""" concept GREAT! The high skill cap means you get to see yourself constantly improve and get better. And a good ranking system to help keep track of your progress. Also literally no P2W in this game which is a huge pet peeve of mine. All items are just for looks!"""
1;Recommend this game as it is really fun when you start off and it is a friendly game unless you get toxic people in your lobby. The game has a great motivating factor in ranked which wants you to push your limits and get to the highest rank you can possibly get which is quite difficult but overall the game is loads of fun
1;This is a game that is just loads of fun. I don't want you to not buy it so in the words of Billy Joel I must tell you about it tell you about everything I feel give you a reason to accept that it's for real so here it is. Listen Boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away you know I don't like watchinganybody make the same mistakes others made. It's a real nice game and she's always there to play. You're a big boy now buy the game.
1;I purchased Rocket League on July 23 2015 as my first ever steam game and I havent had a period longer than a week where I didnt want to play it. If you can get commited to this game and get past the toxicity then this game is amazing and worth buying.
1;Incredibly addicting gameplay. The fun level is off the charts! This is the closest thing to a true sports game I've ever played you are truly rewarded for your time investment with ever increasing skill. The developer is constantly adding new incredible features mostly based on community feedback. This is the best time money ratio of any game I own.
1;I do recommend this game I love it so much however I have had so many times where I wanted to completely quit this game. There are people who think that just because it's a game it's ok to call people bad or useless or even tell other to kill themselves. This games community is super toxic but if you can look past that then this game is amazing.
1;I originally bought Rocket League as a second game I would only play if I was with friends but it's turned into the main game I play! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves cars and/or soccer. And if you have friends who own it multiplayer Rocket League is the best!
1;TL DR Concept sounds dumb Great fun It's highly addictive. )Played for probably 1500hrs (1000 on my account and roughly 500 with my brother at his place) and i'm still not great at it. Maybe slightly ok... but i just can't stop playing that damn game. So i guess i would recommend getting the game. )
1;This game simply creates emotion. Whether it's pure frustration or elation you will experience it. Scoring a last gasp winner or conceding a heartbreaking own goal it's all part of what makes Rocket League great. Psyonix have a very active community and they re trying to engage with fans of the game in all sorts of ways. The e sports section is also growing which culminates in a yearly World Championship which is viewed by more each year.10/10
1;This game at its most basic form is literally soccer with rocket propelled cars. But it's so much more than that. There's different angles on how to hit the ball. There's using your boost to propel you into the air rather than to speed up into the ball. On top of all that it's a team based game. If you don't work together more than likely you're not going to win. This game is incredibly complex for how seemingly simple it is.
1;12 Dollars!?!?! This game on sale is basically the best thing ever. Its worth $60! Its fast paced and well thought out. chat spamming should be a little more strict but man this game is fantastic. KEEP DEVELOPING IT! I feel like more maps user maps and more cars/game modes would make this a game to threaten the popularity of Halo and CoD.
1;Possibly one of the most unique games you can play right now. The skill cap is practically infinite there are many different game modes to keep you interested and overall its one of the best games out there right now. The only issue is the servers as the U.S. West one's can be questionable to say the least and there isn't U.S. Central servers. Regardless I have 500+ hours in as of writing this and I don't intend to stop playing it any time soon. 9/5/10.
1;I found this game to be very fun although not everyone may think the same i would like to say that it was more then i expected.At first i didnt like it cause of it stingy controls but arter a while you get use to them and you dont get botherd by them.
1;Very casual and addictive game. Content (besides crates) is being added frequently and bugs are getting fixed (from what I understand). The only real downside to the game is the excessively toxic community (even worse than csgo). Nothing lacks the game gameplay is awesome everything is perfect.
1;RECOMMENDED!!!At first it looks like an absurd concept of playing football with cars specially for all fifa lovers who think that this game will not have tactical and skill play moves but believe me when I tell you tha it has all that and much much more this game is based on pure skills even the slightest movement and positioning error can change outcome of a match.It gets regular updates and it just gets better with every new one. Must buy.Must have.Totally worth the price.
1;game is about 90% luck 10% raging. skills doesnt matter to win if you are lucky you win if your opponent is lucky no matter how good you are he still wins. Overall this game is fun until now i've only entered the hospital a total of 12 times due to over stress. 10/10 would enter the hospital again !
1;This is a 10/10 game. I have easily put 700 hours into this game and I will put in 700 more! Then 700 more! There's not much I can say besides get this game! Worth it.Edit Just updating my review. I still think it's a 10/10 game. I even have 3700+ hours at the time of this edit which is 1600 more hours than I said I would have total when I said I would add 700 more and 700 more again.
1;Very fun game. Once you get better competitive gets very fun and enjoyable. I highly reccomend playing with friends because it makes it highly enjoyable. The fact you are driving flying cars just makes the game very fun. I would rate this game 10/10. Very fun. Also anything non multiplayer isnt very fun. 10/10!
1;This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Great fun with friends and to mess around in. If you are into competitve games than I STRONGLY recommend this game if you haven't played it already because it can get very competitive the more time you invest in this game. The better you get at the game (which all comes with time) the more fun the game gets for you. 10/10
1;"""Such a great and fun game... Great for both the casual and hardcare gamer. Dont let the concept of """"football with cars? how childish"""" fool you this game requires high skill to play properly. One of the best times I have had with a game in quite a while. Whether its the online competition or the much missed split screen gaming of old this game is great!I highly recommend this game ! two thumbs up XD"""
1;Soccercars has changed my entire outlook on localcoop online coop gaming. Grab one or two buddies and pick this up. has 4v4 too but ITS MADNESS. As much as i'd like to go into the lack of game modes or the limited customization..the truth is this game is fantastic and lacks very very little. Soccercars is my new love.
1;Havent had so much fun on a game in years! This game is epic and if you dont have it yet you should buy it now PTrust me. You need Rocket League! Cross platform with PS4 so lots of people onlineRuns smooth as silkGraphics look AwsomeFully supports xbox controller10/10
1;"""Easy to play incredibly difficult to master. Rocket League is a simple game with an ever increasing skill curve. Matches are 5 minutes long which have attributed to many """"Just one more..."""" Power sessions. Incredible game. Incredible devs. This is easily my favorite game."""
1;absolutely great game perfect to waste time on with a small game time of 5 minutes. at first you may be daunted by the people in your games making aerials all the time but the more time you put in to the game eventually you'll be doing that too and its great. rocket league for me is a 10/10.
1;You are guaranteed to love this game if you either have a social personality or a competitive one. The beauty of it is you can take it seriously to play the ranked system or you can have fun with your friends no problem or both. Also the devs are always coming up with new fun ways to play the game and further entertain their fans. Good game over all.
1;SUPERSONIC ACROBATIC ROCKET POWERED BATTLE CARS SEQUEL LONG AWAITED YOU CAN MAKE YOUR CARS LOOK AS GAY OR AS STRAIGHT AS YOU LIKE THERES NO DISCRIMINATION. GAME OF THE YEAR AWARD 2015 CONFIRMED ITS PRETTY INTENSE.(Could probably do with a controller though unless you are PRO AS F**K)
1;Good controls on the controler if you like using that i personaly do. This game is a fun time with friends then alone. The game is very competitive with online people. That makes the task hard when making a group but is so worth it when you get the perfect people together!
1;To me this is this year's biggest surprise. I tried this game on the PS4 because it was free on PS+ and I got hooked immediately. It's an amazing skill based game with simple controls but with high skill ceiling. The you can with this game's simple controls is nothing short of extraordinary.I wholeheartadly recommend this game to anyone who loves videogames and having tons of fun playing them.
1;Easy to learn difficult to master.So much fun to be had in this game pulling off epic goals and last ditch saves. A game only lasts 5 10 minutes to its great for a short session. In built ranking ladders and car customisation give you a sence of progress and you wont want to put this game down.I highly Reccommend you play with a controller though as it is the best way by far!
1;Nice shot!Nice shot!Nice shot! Great controls. Simple but it has a high skill ceiling. Fun and addictive gameplay. Awesome developers that listen to the community. Frequent updates.One of my fav games of all time. It is a great party game or you can play ranked which gets really hard as you progress through ranks.Go buy it and hook up your controller ASAP!
1;I know that i just played 1 hour but before i bought this game i was playing on the cracked version wich it don't have no multiplayed but it was a lot of fun even with bots and then i decided to buy the game on Steam abd i'm enjoying a lot more!! I recommend you to buy this game! Just buy it!
1;I may not have the full 100 hours under my belt currently i am at 4 hours but believe me this is the most fun i've had in 2 years! The controls bit wonky at the start but really easy to pick up but hard to master. So many different strategies in one football/soccer game! And it even is entertaining to watch! I bought this game and it did NOT dissapoint i know i will get many hours out of this game!The lootboxes are quite a let down but oh well wat can you do about it
1;When I saw friends playing and looked at videos I thought sure this may be fun but it's not for me.Then they convinced me to try. 15 minutes later I was hooked bought my own copy and can't stop playing.The arcady controls combined with a good physics engine just makes this game awesome. try it!
1;Amazin game I've been looking for a game like this for ages. The balance that the devs managed to get between simplistic design and yet extremely advanced gameplay is amazing. No matter how many hundreds of hours you play this game you'll always improve unlike many other games. People complain all the time about the servers but honestly I never experience lagg. Ez Pz 10/10
1;Rocket League has a good learning curve decent matchmaking systems for low to midtier ranks and overall fun and satisfying gameplay with a variety of modes. It's a nice game to play while listening to music or podcasts and the like. 800 hours in and I'm not bored of it mostly because there's a lot of room to improve.This game is getting updates that add more customization maps and gamemodes every few months or so.20 euros/dollars/pounds are definitely worth it in my opinion.
1;Good game with a lot off featuers .rocket league is one of the best games about soccer i ever played fifa is too boring for me kappa. In free time you can trade with other pepole using items what you loot in game andBTw. this game is good to make new friends.i aproved that game have fun
1;Ah sweet Rocket League. The game the gets you screaming after getting a Long Goal or hitting that Epic Save. This game is an incredibly fun and crazy game and I'm surprised the idea took so long to produce. Though sometimes frustrating this game provides countless hours of ball hitting fun and I love that it's so goofy. This game is a definite must have is you enjoy cars and soccer or even one by themself. P.S. get the DLCs they're great.
1;Rocket League is just a gorgeous game.I'm sitting at an amount of 1 400 hours writing this review and I have no plan of ever stopping to play it.I could praise this game for actual hours praise the way it makes you want to improve praise the fun this game includes but I don't really want to.There are some other really great reviews out there and I just wanted to mention how much I love this game and give it another positive review.
1;If you are playing from Asia do not buy this game!Every continent has its own server only Africa and Asia there are no servers...The ping will be high and everybody playing close to the server will get advantage.Good game but not for asians yet...EditedNow they do have asian and many another regions servers.Thanks devs.
1;With over 2500+ hours across PS4 X Box One and Steam and over 2 years of owning the game on PS4... I feel that you can trust my review. Rocket League is one of those games that you play when you don't know what to do. Rocket League is amazing. I have met new friends and progressed past my expectations. If you take a break for a few months you will lose most of your skill... Trust me I know.If you haven't played Rocket League buy it. I've never met someone that regrets the $20 investment!
1;I was sad to let go of Rocket League for a second time(the first time when i switched from xbone to PC) and i am missing it already as it is one of those once in a generations lifetime where it has so much charm in it that u feel like its that friend u love see everyday as they give u the fun times
1;Literally the best game I have ever play. So much replay value. Takes complete skill by user no assists at all so everyone is on a level playing field. Only takes the time and effort of the user to excel at this game. Honestly the best game I have ever played.
1;Spend years obsessed with random little game called Rocket Power Battle CarsOnly game I'm good atEverying beats me at other games cause I don't practiceCry for yearsRocket League comes outOnly one with rocket car skillsWreck everyone with 5+ goals every gameThen the game server goes down cause it's the first day of launch and that happens with every game. Now I'm back to being a loser.Please buy so I can finally beat you too
1;at almost 3k hours think it's time for a review.One of the best games i played with very high skill cap. More time you invest the better you get. Trading make this even more fun when you want to take a break from playing and upgrade your car! Constant updates hearing the community is the key to success and it's filling both.
1;Not a big fan of soccer (not since 2001 anyway) and cars are nice but I don't consider myself an enthusiast.But put those things together and man u have a MASTAHPIECE. Addictive gameplay fast and smooth lobbies for a quick online bout sweet customization options yadda yadda yadda Rocket League has it all.I usually don't have time for more than 2 3 online games in my life at any given moment but this one always makes the cut.10/10
1;"""This is the ultamate """"Just one more"""" game. Even if this game was 60 bucks I would recommend the game. You will find yourself in this game for hours on end. Granted there is a learning curve but you will find that you have the skills needed just by playing."""
1;I really like this game but there is just one problem.Well in this game there are 2 maps that people who have lower specs pc lag i get 25 fps...Sometimes i cant hit the ball because of this lag...So if the put that we dont like the map why do i play on it for like 1 in 5 times? Just for derank me?I would like to dont play in this maps because i cant just play on them.But Rocket League still a fun game and an awesome game Recomend )
1;Absolutely Amazing Game!One of my friends introduced it to me a month back and I havent stopped playing since. I will say that it is very frustrating on the different servers that have some lag even if you know you have a decent connection and CPU. Not to mention some of the mouthy and arrogant people that also tend to bring this game down. I highly recommend this game to those who love fast action games. 9/10 D
1;Such an awesome game. With high intensity gameplay and fast paced gameplay it's a game I was not expecting to have such a long game play value. The learning curve is very little and tutorials/training makes starting out easy.Currently the only con would be the server issues the game are having but of course this is just due to massive amounts of players wanting to play. Give a couple minutes and you will get a game.Highly recommend.
1;Definitely one of the best competitive games and really freshening in contrast to the strung out matches in shooters.It's also a great deal for casual gamers since the ranking system considers their individual skill. Matches just last a few minutes (5 + goal cam) and it's perfect to dawdle away some time (even though you will mostly start one game after each other ) ). Long story short it won't be a mispurchase.
1;I like upgrading my car i just got an import body its sickk!!I love playing with my bro yyrkoon and gc playa who would of thought of cars playing soccer but i wish you could buy crates thats the thing hope they make a change to that soon butm still its an awesome game i think you should get it you could even join the clan
1;One of the Best Games on Steam it's so much fun to play pulling off amazing tricks and scoring give you the greatest feelings you can possibly have towards this game it's a Must Play 10/10 would flip through the air to hit the ball into the goal again!!
1;"""I don't like cars I don't like soccer I don't like digital sports I don't like rockets nor jet propultion I don't like leagues I don't like being told """"What a Save"""" when I let in a goal and I don't like the person I've become. I wish I never bought this game. 7/10"""
1;Honestly when I first saw it I thought it was a cool concept and all but I didn't think it was worth $20. But then my friend gifted it to me so we could play together and now after about 20 hours of gameplay in a little over 2 days I can say this was probably the best $20 gift I've ever gotten.
1;This is an awesome game it's one of my favourites. The matches aren't heavily time consuming so it's a great game to pick up and kill a few minutes. It also has a great competitive system if you are into ranks.Lastly I highly reccomend a controller to be used. I played this with keyboard and mouse for a long time and I could definately see the difference in performance once I started using an xbox 360 controller on my PC. It just makes the gameplay smoother.
1;Probably one of the best games i have ever played this game is SO damn addictive and i cant stop playing it! Once you get the hang of it it will be even more fun D Im playing on a keyboard but im probably gonne get myself a controller since ive heard its way better! p
1;Approaching 1000 hours and no regrets.Rocket League is by far my favourite game of all time. I love seeing an eSport grow as the pros are still modest and humble the players are still friendly and the community is contantly growing!From a game perspective great concepts and fluent gameplay. Furthermore the devs dont f*** around they have and continue to release great content and updates. Keep doing what you're doing Psyonix.
1;This is a good competitive sports game that is a blast to play with friends. I have a few issues with it however overall it's a very solid release and I highly recommend it.Pros * Fun game play* Online Matchmaking* Easy to start hard to master* Large active communityCons * Needs better keyboard / mouse support* Needs ability to further tweak graphic options (some fog and post processing is always enabled)* Needs a more refined match making rank system.
1;It's amazing game. And the rankings could not be better. When your a rookie you learn from big mistakes. When your a semi pro your working on gettting a advanced skill set and getting better overall. And from Pro and beyond you master of being a good rocket leaguer. This game takes time. But I hate soccer but I love this game. Please buy this.
1;Love This Game so much Played it First on Xbox and Moved to Pc one complaint I have is not being able to trade from xbox to pc and Xbox not being allowed to trade keys i think it Would be an easy fix if i am wrong im sorry but i belive it wouldnt be hard to implement
1;So adictive and so fun packed in this Car + Football game. Such simple premises couldn't be more right the adrenaline and the excitement you get in the field is great. Also the community is awesome for casual and competitive gameplay. Try to enjoy with friends.
1;Rocket League is one of my favorite games of all time. I have been playing it for months and I don't get tired of it no matter how frustrating it is at times. It's a weird game in that the lows are vastly outweighed by the highs so you keep coming back.
1;Rocket league is all about the tense moment right before you start an aerial. The ball floating above the goal. All u must do is execute a perfectly double jump aerial to nudge the ball forward into the back of the enemies net. All of a sudden ur car decides to backflip instead of jumping. You miss the goal. The other team clears their shot goes in. Forever Potato 1.... (10/10 would backflip again)
1;I don't think I've ever played a game that I thought was perfect until I played Rocket League. If you're not into sports you'll love this game. If you're not into cars you'll love this game.I can't recommend this game enough.Even the dlc is worth it's price. Very inexpensive and adds some of my favorite cars and some customizations too
1;Good game when you play casual.BUT HOLY ING THE RAKING SYSTHEM IS YOU WIN A GAME 10 0 YOU GET ING 2 POINTS AND LOSE A GAME 3 4 AND LOSE MOTHER ING 12 POINT WTFFFFFFF LIKE THIS IS PLEB. ING HORSE THE RANKING SYSTHEM WAS MADE BY PEASANTS. LIKE I S H I T YOU NOT THE GUY DOES NOT KNOW HOW MATH WORKS. but realy fun game i recomnec it )
1;This game is the game of all games. You will only come across a game like this once in your whole lifetime. It brings a tear to my eye how crisp the gameplay is and also the fact that they even though of bringing cars to football. I gives me great honour to say that i have played the hell out of this game and i am so greatful to live when this game is out. 10/10 would bang no homo )
1;Nice shot Psyonix!!Really an amazing game!! Nicely done.Rocket League is more of a skill based game where you are given everything in the beginning of the game.. your experience or rank doesn't give you any extra boost and any better car.. Its just the more you play the better you get.Psyonix giving free arenas and updates! dlc cars just have a nominal cost. Its a greate game and I do recommend trying it...you will end up spending a lot of time playing it.Enjoy D
1;This game is easy to pick up but hard to master. It's good whether you have 10 minutes to play or a few hours and even better when you have friends to play with. The community in this game can be a bit.. unfortunate sometimes but other than that I've enjoyed this game much more than I expected to. If you're on the fence about getting this game I'd suggest giving it a try.
1;Great fast paste game. Rocket jumping becomes mandatory if you want to get good. Despite the simplicity its not an easy game at all!The ranking surly has some probems we got 4 5 points each win and than we got obliterated and got like 11 points.The community ist mostly friendly but people leaving when they realise the game is lost... thats just sad. Game handles that very well though first a bot jumps in and then a player joins as soon as possible.
1;Look this game is cool but you should fix the Bans i tried to play online and controller disconnected then i went to reconnect my controller and had some problems when i came back i was kicked for being idle and couldn't rejoin also i was banned from matchmaking Ranked and Unranked
1;Pretty good when playing in a party with multiple modes to pick from. The Rumble update added a new fun gamemode which changes up the game significantly and is much fun to play with friends (my hours on this game increased by at least 20 within the first week of the Rumble update). The game does get rather boring when going solo but that is down to the team that you get put on XD
1;I never was a fan of soccer games and not really too much of a fan of car games but this combination is very fun!This is a fanastic game with a very high skill cap that gives you hours of play in an increasing variety of game modes. All added maps and game modes in patches are free to play which is pretty awesome. They add a few small DLCs that are pretty low cost and add a few extra cars to play with and decorative items.
1;Really fun game for anyone that just wants to chill or get competitive. It's great to play with friends and there are plenty of gamemodes to keep you interested. I highly recommed this game to anyone looking for a good time especially if they enjoy soccer basketball and driving games.
1;This game is totally awesome and I've spent huge amount of time playing it.But recently I have an issue with it. After the upload the interface changed into Russian and I as a native speaker can say that Russian is very poor. Translation of some words is completely wrong and sometimes it's absolutely not clear what it says (makes no sense).I may even offer you my help with the translation but Russian language in Rocket League needs changes )Thank you!
1;Even though it takes a while to get used to the game is insanely fun to play. The premise of the game may seem simple/boring but it's really not. Slightly disappointed due to unavailability of cross platform parties but other than that the game is well worth the money spent on it.
1;"""A very fun game that is really enjoyable with friends. On the other hand I can't say I've enjoyed the game on my own 90% of all the games I joined had toxic people typing """"ez ez"""" and what not. Apparently they get satisfied by typing""""botgame"""" """"easy"""" """"forfeit pls"""" etc i'm not triggered just dissapointed. One tip set chat to team only or disable it awhole (in audio settings) to have a more enjoyable time on Rocket League ."""
1;"""Rocket League""""What I'm not addicted.......you don't know my life.....I can stop whenever I want......"""" Rocket League theme Music starts playing *3hrs laterJust one more matchJust one more matchJust one more match Chat is disabled for 3 Seconds ............Just one more match______________________________________________________"""
1;Think i've found my Best Game Of 2015 right here everythings great about this game can't praise the devs enough everything they've done is great nothing is pay to win they've listened to community feedback and made adjustments to the game based on that feedback not buying the DLC's wont exclude you from any matchmaking it's all just perfect.
1;Very fun. If you watch a gameplay video an think to yourself Thats Looks Awesome! Your gonna love this game. One thing i do wish they would add tho Is a multiplayer freeroam mode or Like a Tag Mode. Both Would Be really Fun. Would Love to see a tag game mode!
1;"""Short review The GOTY of 2015 for me! Ridiculously fun and outrageous fastpaced multiplayer sport action! So easy to learn yet so hard to master! A game that makes you think """"Just one more game"""" over and over again until you have to go to bed to even have the slightest chance to function properly the day after! An instant classic and a must buy for everyone even the slightest interested in any kind of sport game! Utterly recommended!"""
1;I didn't realise how high the skill ceiling was until watched Kronovi.Easy to pick up hard to master but when you do get your first aerial goal you will feel like a god. Even now after 308 hrs(!) I still get that feel when I pull off an awesome goal (albeit rarely for me (). Looks simple but there is depth. Just watch Kronovi that guy is ridiculous (I'm sure there are others too that's just who I've seen).
1;FIFA for men.All jokes aside this game is amazing. With mechanics that make me question how the hell I just shot a ball into a goal from halfway across the field in a car with a rocket strapped to it the game clearly wasn't built around the concept of how but rather why not?The bots are a little dumb sometimes with a goal every now and then being a bot just driving into their own goal with the ball in tow.A must buy for anyone who likes ingenuity.
1;This game is so ing fantastic even better if you have friends to play with. There's nothing like the joy of pulling a Messiesque play and having your car projected across the whole field after the ball explodes as it enters the net. It also comes with a very neat replay editor.Besides some server issues at the time of launch (there's a ton of players online at this moment) the game is really worth it. Also the devs have been very quick to respond to the connection issues and they are amazing.
1;After countless hours of gameplay still a lot a fun and with and infinite learning curve since you can always improve.The devs continue to be very active throughout so don't worry with minor bugs they're getting patched constantly.10/10! Would fly after the ball again.
1;The learning curve for this game is so high. When I started people were hitting insane shots that I never thought I would be able to hit. After 1 100+ hours in this game I can finally do all the cool stuff that I had wanted since I started. This game is so much fun especially when you have a friend or two who like it as much as you. Give this game a chance you won't regret it.
1;It's funny because I don't really enjoy racing games and I also don't enjoy Football yet for some reason I enjoy this game. It seems like such a silly idea yet it's extremely addicting fun and I can play for hours! There always seems to be room to improve. I would highly recommend this game! (Dank Soundtrack too)
1;I never thought I'd see the day when I could tell people that my favorite sport involves slamming balls into a net from midair. With a car. That's right a f***ing car.Well I guess that day has come.10/10 most fun I've had playing a game in a while. Even more fun with friends. Buy it you won't regret it.
1;Very simple mechanics makes this physics based Rocket Car soccer game easy to learn but very difficult to master. The competitive nature of this game keeps you on the edge of your seat and every goal feels ridiculously exciting. The ease in which you can follow whats going on in the game makes it a shoe in for the next big e sports game and I look forward to seeing it develop.
1;I can't remember the last time I played a game THIS fun! It's challenging competitive fast paced.. Controls may be quite hard to master (I mean it must not be easy to hit a bouncing ball with a car) but once you do (it won't take long... you just have to figure out how the ball's and cars' physics work) it really gets soooo exciting.I totally recommend this game! It's worth every cent!
1;I find it fun to play beautiful graphics fun with friends.One thing though. The season rewards if you do the comp 12 games won itll make you do the amount of games your rank say gold 64 games all over again. I would reccomend it to have fun but not competitvly.
1;I have played the game before getting it on steam. If you're looking to kill some time this would be the way to do it. ProsFun gameplay.Great mechanics.Easy to play.Hard to master.ConsThe community like most competitive games is cancerous.EDIT I am editing this for a badge my guy.
1;100% recommended. I dislike football. I'm not interested at all into cars.I dislike both Football games and driving games. But GOD ROCKET LEAGUE IS SUPER MEGA AWESOME *_* And it fullfill all kind of competetive thoughts someone could have the maximum skillcap of this game is like.... UNLIMITED *_*
1;This game... Oh man where do I start. I have to say I love this game no matter how hard it is when you first start out its just too much fun. play with friends its even better. there is so much you can do in the game and thats what i love. its too much fun even if you are loosing.
1;Think of soccer.With cars.With rocket boosted cars.That can fly.On a soccer pitch.With a ceiling and walls.With a giant ball.That explodes.Up to 4 players on a team.Absolute chaos.And everyone chasin' the ball just to get it into that glorious goal.And that is what Rocket League is.You should get it.P.S. *cough* Rocketpass is stupid don't waste your money *cough* *cough*
1;After 250+ hours playing RC I can just say... After couple of hours practicing it will became your life. There is no way back after your first areal. The game by it self is amazing. No bugs almost every 2 months an update. The only downside about this game is not really the game it self. ITS THE COMMUNITY. People arent nice but there are few exeptions. 10/10 would buy again.
1;Rocket League pretty much sums up the old adage Easy to lean hard to master.At the start you'll be happy every time you hit the ball but by the time you get a hundred hours or so into the game aerials become the thing yyou chase after. It's a never ending chase after sicker and sicker plays and it's brillianr.
1;While I only have 240hours gameplay I'd recommend playing it for these few reasons.1. DLC every couple months and also very cheap adding new items into the game2. There are many different playstyles you can have to learn.It's a game where you can either choose to learn and come out on top. Or fall miserably to the players who have 700 hours of practice under them.
1;One of the few games you play and just keep playing because it doesn't get boring! Every match is different and the community is so amazing. And the developers are the real heroes because they make free new updates every single month! With new game modes maps cars items and more awesome stuff. Defenitly my favorite game right now!
1;"""I think the central genius of Rocket League is that it compounds the accessibility + depth of soccer with the accessibility + depth of racing games. You can understand the game immediately upon seeing it but it's totally fresh and it supports a rich infinite and easily understood skill progression. It's one of those rare games that lives up to the """"a minute to learn a lifetime to master"""" mantra."""
1;Keep coming back to this game over and over. Great for a quick fix or a marathon. Great learning curve where it is easy to pick up and play yet will take a long time to master as you gradually get better over time. Great cross platform play. I had to play for a long time on my PS4 before the SteamOS / Linux version finally came out. Plays fantastic on my 1060 NVidia card.
1;"""Occasionally my wife will walk in the office and say """"Ugh. You're playing that stupid remote control car soccer game again?"""" and I say """"Yes. Can you make me some pizza rolls?"""" and she says """"Make them yourself.""""10/10 but I still have no pizza rolls.UPDATE Over 400 hours in. Still addicted"""
1;Surprisingly fun and challenging. I can't put it down once I get going. It takes a lot more skill and finesse to control the cars than you would think. A breath of fresh air. The style and overall atmosphere of the game is top notch as well. The devs hugely support this game and I think it will be a staple in gaming for a long time. Highly recommended.
1;Honestly I was a bit turned off at first. The controls were hard to master and I thought that just hitting the ball around was kind of boring. But once I actually got better I started to enjoy Rocket League. It gets a bit repetitive at times but the devs are great at adding new content and aesthetic items to keep it fresh. Plus now that I'm a bit more advanced I'm getting some really great plays!
1;Great game. Very fun and what's good is that there's always room for improvement in this game. All kinds of game modes (1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4) which I like a lot. I play this with my friend and we have so many great laughs together as well (Something not entirely common in games). I'd reccomend to anyone if they like soccer/racing or not. Fantastic.
1;"""I nominated the game for the """"Just 5 more minutes"""" Award.Cars and soccer... Simple concept done great! 20 bugs is an absolutely fair price.+ many game modes+ free maps and new game modes coming with updates+ not connected with steam market+ very funny especially with friends+ skill based game with a huge learning curve toxic community dlc cars"""
1;It's Soccer/Football in cars that can jump roll and fly. Games are short (5 minutes) fast paced and intense. Like all sports you get scpre blow outs at times but they aren't overly common. Even a 2 or 3 goal lead can (and does) evaporate quickly. Buy it. Play it. You will not regret it.
1;I get to drive around blowing up other cars while playing soccer hockey basketball or this weird floor thingy. Over all very enjoyable and simple idea that has been done in an amazing manner. Bonus points for flailing uncontrollably through the air in a failed attempt to hit the ball. 10/10
1;This game is alot of fun... But if u dont have a friend or friends to play with it can get boring after awhile so I recommend to buy it if u have someone u can play with! But overall this game is amazing. A bit glitchy but that doesnt show as often as on other games. I recommend you to buy this game if u like fun/action/car/football games DD
1;Its football with a car. Sounds like a partygame right? Something u will play one time and never touch again? U HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE!I bought this game 2 weeks ago and have played 60 hours already..ITS SO FUN AND AND AND.. just freaking buy it it keeps you hooked for aslong as you want . Customization feels epic scoring feels epic and lets not even start about how flying into a ball feels...9/10 Buy. It. Now.
1;By now you already know what this game is about so no need for an introduction. Highly competitive skill based game. It will take a huge chunk of your time to master but you can enjoy it at all skill levels. More content like cars cosmetics and maps are added from time to time in the from of DLC.
1;High skill cap every time I play I see people doing tricks that are better then me so I continue to strive to become better. Lots of replay value because of the high skill ceiling and the devs are patching and communicating constantly. Highly recommend if you are a fan of soccer or cars or rockets or just play ole fun. Controller strongly recommended.
1;one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match one more match...
1;640 hours in I can honestly say this is one of my favorite games of all time.It fits my schedule perfectly being that I often only have 30 minutes to play between other things I'm doing.This game is extremely easy to learn and EXTREMELY HARD to master.I have purchased copies of this for several friends and constantly prosthelytize it.I can't recommend it highly enough definitely check it out.
1;What can I say about this game?A M A Z I N GI'm not a big fan or soccer or cars in real life but this game is just so much fun I can't get tired of it! The music is awesome many different maps you can costumize your car and even trade items there are regular updates which always manage to amaze me and make the game ever better. Rocket League is just fun that's all I have to say about this masterpiece now go and buy it 3!
1;A game that you can play for short breaks or hours on end. Nothing beats playing 3v3 with a group of your friends. High skill ceiling and you never stop learning. Company continues to add new features and maps for no additional cost. Why don't you own this already?
1;Awesome game easy to learn but very hard to master because of the high skill level. But once u get used to it its great for quick games since matches are just 6 7 min and so u dont need to spend too much time for each game. However you will need to spend a bit of time to get good and to get the nuances.But you will enjoy it no doubt.
1;Well I've been playing this game for a long time and I love it but theres one problem. The maps. Aquadome needs to leave asap. People with computers that aren't like amazing can't handle it. It should at least be non playable on ranked because it kills my game. I've seen many people that actually have good computers complain about this map. This is just a suggestion obviously but if you could do anything that'd be great.
1;Lemme tell ya what this game is top LOL. its fun and i have become pretty decent. Considering im like the Ray Charles of real soccer this makes me feel good about myself. If you struggle with coordination like 1 in 4 people like me this is the game for you.
1;Definitely my favourite game. Enjoyed the prequel on PS3 and this game ramped up a brilliant idea in every way. It's hilarious and fun due to everyone being bad at the start and enthrallingly competitive once you get better. I'm at 3000 matches and counting definitely a hard game to put down! The e Sports scene is very entertaining to watch as well.10/10 reccommended!
1;Why I like about this game Its easy to play with friendsI love soccer and cars this brings them both together DFun gamemodes like Hoops rumble etcCompetitive game modes if your feeling competitiveIts cheap runs on bad quality computersWhat I dont like about this game the crates are rigged (not really) but they do take forever to getno rewards for completing achievementsIs the game worth it? Well yes indeed it is it is very addicting and fun to play with friends aswell as streamers from twitch!
1;So Rocket League ... is just one of the best games currently out there if you like skill games. It's really easy to get into but so hard to master. I've had hundreds of hours of fun with it so far an it's simply one of the deepest game mechanics i've seen in any game ever. Even after of these hundreds of hours there's so much space for me to improve. Also it's great to play with one or more friends.Easy 10/10 for me and definately recommended.
1;I always thought this game looked stupid. Then i bought it only because i though it would be a good (of very limited options) splitscreen game when my pc was hooked up in the living. In no time i was hooked. Super fun game. Its amazing how such a simple game can remain fun after 100 hours.
1;I would highly recommend this game to the one who seeks for an addictive indie and competitive sport game. Also it's an excellent time killing game because a match takes only five minutes. The game is easy to learn but hard to be pro at it. More interestingly playing with friends would be perfect and fun as communication is very important. It can be ridiculously hilarious at times especially when playing with friends!
1;"""Rocket League is a very fun and enjoyable game even if it is somewhat lacking in variety. Much more exciting than """"normal"""" football and a lot more tense. Controls are easy to learn but hard to master allowing more skilled players to shine above others. Matches are short and can seem quite hectic but a team with proper tactics will still be in a better position to win than a team that doesn't work together. Could easily see this becoming a proper eSports game somewhere along the line"""
1;"""&gt Bought Game&gt Installed Game&gt Launched Game&gt Played Tutorial&gt Realized """"Damn I'm really good at this game""""&gt Played Online&gt Got My Kicked&gt Tried Single Player&gt NPCs are Tough and Kicked My br&gt &gt Raged and blew up ever other car in every game i played&gt Pulled off one sick goal&gt PLayed Crappy the rest of the games10/10 One of the greatest games ive ever played and ive only played it for like 3 hours"""
1;Because i dont like soccer nor cars i did not think i would like this game. But i guess if you combine 2 things you hate it ends up consuming your life. It can be really fun with friends (if you have any) and very competitive. And you get to blow people up.
1;I would never recommend this game to a true friend as I value their life and time. This game is like an abusive relationship. You will get infatuated then get abused and humiliated repeatedly but keep coming back. It will ruin your life. You will think about it when not playing that you should get out of this one and move on. But you will come back to it again.If you are not my friend recommend 100%.
1;"""Pros Rocket cars Racing Explosions Great gameplay and graphics Hats! and lots of customization options and hats! Easy to get in too Doesn't require much memory or a beefy graphics card to run. Basically all you need in a game in one game!Cons Addictive. """"Just one more game then I'll quit"""" 10 games later..."""
1;At the beginning your all rookies and everyone struggles at making a goal celebrating when one does go in then yo get to semi pro and pro and people start making better shots thennnnn you get to veteran and expert where people start making crazy aerials and theennnnnn you get to master and legend where everyone is a flying god on wheels and then roocketeer which i have not seen yet.
1;Genuinely fun game. The mechanics are simple and awesome. Polished to a mirror sheen. Fun the first time you boot it up and fun the 100th time you boot it up. Awesome with friends awesome solo. Would recommend to players of all skill levels and time investment levels.
1;I bought this at the same time as my friend we thought it would just be a casual game. How we were wrong. This is brilliant the range of skill is huge and there will always be room for you to improve. I must say Rocket League is better with at least one friend. Highy reccomended you can get so many hours from such a small price. BUY IT NOW (Be prepared for frustration when you first start)
1;I could sit here all evening figuring out how to tell you guys how good this game really is. Instead i'm gonna keep it short and just tell you this I was never a fan of soccer videogames nor racing games. This is still super amazing and awesome and I completely love it and so will you. Just buy the damn game xD
1;Simple soccer game but with cars so it's like 9000x cooler. Flying around in rocket powered cars to score goals. Simple concept flawless execution game you and every one of your friends should play.I've only set it down to take food and water breaks since I got it (and the occasional downtime from having unreliable internet). What I'm saying is it's awesome.
1;"""One word summerises this game.. """"fun"""".I was a bit uncertain if I would enjoy it not a big fan of car games or soccer games. But together.. well its fun. Extremely accessible to new players.. but clearly difficult to master. Can't see i'll get sick of this game anytime soon."""
1;This game is really fun. There's not much to say about it the gameplay is great and dispite other people's reviews I have great connection on servers. The graphics would be great but with my mediocre PC I had to lower the settings quite a bit. Other than that I would highly reccomend this game to just about anyone.
1;Amazing gameFun fun fun fun. If you loose play again and win. If you win play again and win. Graphics is really good as for my Radeon HD6870 its about 45 55 FPS.But really I didnt know what to think about this game before buying this. Very postitive feedback!
1;So if you have friends this is the best game ever!!! PIts only like 10 euros on Spaces cuz steam cencors it xD) so really no excuseNow they added a trading and crate system with cosmetic items which I admit has persuaded me to spend 10 euros or so...Pros Super fun Don't need to be good to have fun Don't need to like football New updates and DLC's come out often Lots of game modes + competative mode Easy to learn Hard to master Doesn't get boring New Trading/Crate system Cons Rip Life
1;I like to keep me reviews short so here it goes Pros Unique game style like never seen beforeSimple gaming structure yet fun!Very good support and dev's are good community listenersGood musicGreat graphicsAmazing gameplayCons Matchmaking needs improvement.Community flamers is around 2/3 for me
1;Far too many mainstream games these days are very similar and following the same old boring industry cliches.For the first time in years I can honestly say that I experience pure joy from playing this game. Even losing can be really fun.The game is very simple and straightforward yet hits the nail on the head in terms of gameplay mechanics and it's simple objective. It's very fun and I highly recommend it even to people who don't neccasarily like sports type games.
1;This game is one of my favorites. Pretty friendly and competitive community. No . Developer that keeps delivering new content. DLC's that are worth buying for a few bucks. Playing with friends until you rage quit. Quick chat was never this easy and annoying.10/10
1;I didn't plan on buying this game. A friend gifted it to me because he wanted someone to team up with. The concepts are easy. You can pretty much jump in and start winning just knowing the basics. Once you learn the more complex maneuvers however this game becomes incredibly addictive. It's a blast with friends. Everyone should play this game.
1;I have to say this game is absolutely astounding. I don't like games with cars all too much and I hate sports games but rocket league is just right. And even though it seems like it might be the same thing over and over it's always interesting and something different every time you play.
1;I never again need to run out of arguments to annoy my younger brothers! 5/5 +overtime I can never be mad at losing no matter the score I'll be laughing my face sore! 10/10 losses/would lose again If you're used to Losing then this game will make you lose with a smile on your face if you win well....Miracles do happen AWESOME GAME
1;This game is absolutely amazing if i wouldn't have had $20 before i bought it and i knew of the pure ecstacy available within it i would have done some pretty terrible things to get it. $20 well spent my friends. if you havent already bought it. please do so immediately. 10/10 would shoot goal again.
1;The game is awesome! Lots of fun and the way the game is done is just spot on DBut I have to say after 190h of gameplay rocket league has the worst and most toxic comunity I ever played in. Allmost every game ends in rage complaining acusations and negative coments from either one of the teams... It seems like people are not interested in having fun in it only conplain about everything that happends. But if you play with friends its tons of fun DD
1;I might be nubby but If I know anything this game is something EVERYONE should play now you might be asking. I hate soccer but I love cars or I hate cars but I love soccer. Trust me give this game a whirl and you'll fall in love only problem is the matchmaking I see Vets facing Legends or Rocketeers but point aside this game is one of the best I've played and i totes rec. it.Even better once you put enough time into it
1;Playing PC Games for more than 20 years but this masterpiece is more fun than 99% of all the games I played! Multiplayer Highlight!!UPDATE Still Playing! Still fun! Still getting better (slowly) ...UPDATE 2 It's nearly 600 hours ... time to bash the game now like a normal troll? Won't! Still great!
1;Rated E for everyone certainly no toxicity to be found anywhere within this game./sThis is a truly brilliant game. Perhaps a hallmark of it's status among other competitve games is that it has it's very own toxic community.Play without friends at your own peril.Play with friends at your free times peril.
1;i got this game for free on ps4 loved it so much i wore out the right trigger on my ps4 controller from gripping it so hard loved it so much i bought it for the pc as well. i highly recommend this game and also highly recommend using a wired 360 controller instead of keyboard and mouse for this game.game is simple to pick up and learn but very hard to master simple controls simple but good enough graphics good competitive game.
1;This is my favorite game on Steam currently (I have 340 total games with all my accounts) and for good reason. I throughly enjoy Rocket League the tactics of it the replayability the awesome wheels and car builds I can unlock and just the game in general. I honestly have no idea WHY I love this game but it's truly got me hooked right now. Please someone help. xD
1;Oddly enough I've never enjoyed online PvP games I've always sucked when playing other people. I'm also not a huge soccer guy.I love Rocket League! Super simple to start playing and there doesn't seem to be a skill ceiling. I've still got a ways to go as far as skill but I enjoy every game I play. It's much more than a simple arcade game.
1;I generally don't like either racing or sports games on the PC but Rocket League manages to combine and transcend both genres in a very fun way. I do play it with a Logitech F310 controller which is a very cheap way to get a lot more enjoyment out of the game. The replay value and fun to be had are well worth the price of this game even if you think you don't typically enjoy the genre.
1;"""Brilliant Game!Easy to get into but hard to master. Can't remember when I was last this pleasantly surprised by a game. It started of as a """"Fun to play with your friends"""" game But it left that mark at the same point as you leave the ground. After that you can't play together with those that doesn't see clear enough to realize this is one of the best games ever made!Now if only could get good at this..."""
1;Things that are good FUN! addictive gameplay multiple game mods never let you get bored customization Things that are not so good i can fool the game by leaving tthe match any time i think i will loose a season match thus i will alwasys have perfect score in any season i play
1;Love the game Can just come home after work turn it on and chill playing it for an hour or two.It really is just a pick up and play and if you need to head out well thats fine because rounds only last 5 minutes.Only thing wrong with it is the smurfs. I don't understand why people smurf you're not good if you can only beat people who play it casually )I'd recommend a buy anyhow seen as most smurfs cry hard when you can beat them which is funny to see xD
1;Amazing game with great looking cars! Awesome games physics and concept..Totally love it!Personally I think the best parts of this game is to control the car with complete freedom and ofcource the dope af songs!Although should add an option for playing songs during the matches.
1;As shown by the 93% of positive evaluations this games is good very good.Content is frequently added and the community is huge.A lot of customization available including in game settings which can really enable you to create unique and fun experiences.This is one of those games that are very easy to learn but extremely difficult to master. The difference in skills is absolutely all that matters a gaps in experience will greatly show ingame.Lots of fun ahead of you go buy this game.
1;Easy to pick up highly addicting game. The gameplay gets more exciting and fast as you learn more complex techniques such as aerial shots. The cars are great and the extras and customizations are neat. The game seems stabile and not overdone although some fields (maps) seem to lag a bit more than others. Highly recommend teaching yourself the right techniques to save yourself and your teammates frustration. Watch the pros compete too you'll learn what works.
1;Why are you even reading these to figure out if you should buy the game? You know at elast one person who would attest this is pure greatness. Just buy it love it and then write Psyonix a letter saying how this game allowed you to become a better person.
1;This game is really fun with friends. Car customisations are really nice with some very cool combinations. The gameplay itself? Simple concept difficult to master. The game devs really work hard to improve this game and listen to the community. The devs add extremely cool and unique DLC which are worth the price. The devs already include a lot of free stuff for everyone so support them. What are you waiting for? Buy the game!
1;Though I dont like soccer games neither cars games(though these last ones I can play and maybe enjoy if it is good) because I am more FPS kind of player though this game is another level I have had enjoyed hours playing with friends and with random people as well it is something very competitive and nice! excellent game I enjoy it a lot!
1;Wow. I have been looking at this game ever since I started seeing clips of gameplay on reddit. I thought it looked cool but was worried that it would get boring. I took a chance and let me tell you....I LOVE THIS GAME. It's simple yes but it's really fun to play. Every game is different. I am not into sports IRL but this game gets my adrenaline flowing. I find myself throwing my hands ip in celebration after every goal! Very fun!
1;Rocket league is not just about hitting a soccer ball with your car. It is a about controlling your boost and driving skills. You can hit the ball in the air or on the ground to score goals and defend the enemy team. Rocket league also has competitive modes and regular modes for more casual players.
1;Extremely addicting. I started playing about 2 weeks ago and I get better every time I play. I haven't had this much fun with a multiplayer game in a long time. The controls might be a bit wonky on keyboard though so I suggest picking up an old xbox 360 or ps3 controller. 10/10
1;This game is incredibly fun however as of late the player base has become extremely passive agressive and toxic.There are still a few players that are genuinely good sports but they often are drowned out by all the people with their heads up their own asses.play with friends report toxic players.
1;This is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer game since battlefield 4. Solid game mechanics with no bugs I've seen in 200+ hours. One of the few games that gets better with each update (psyonix really seems to care about this game) instead of worse. Seriously just buy it.
1;This is probably the best game I have played in a few years there is an awful lot more than meets the eye with split second aerial trick shots huge helpings of strategy flying cars all turned up to 11. It's very hard to put down too vehicle personalisation and simple yet effective communications with both hotkeys and VOIP make this a very community accessible game with cross platform party system to come doubly so. Strongle recommend must be tried!
1;Product received for free. If you like Monster Jam like a true fan as myslef.. you will enjoy this game beacsue of the constant smashing and speed.. use the hotshot because it gives the highest damge to the ball.. i also suggest turnign the cheering fans off because it is quite annoying.. hjonestly i dont even know if t hey are cherrign for mne or naught.
1;I really enjoyed playing this game. The thematic is awesome and has a great potential to be an e sport.There's one thing I really miss in the game which is the absence of a mini map.I hope on the next roll up updates that could be included.Recomended.
1;Rocket League is incredibly accessible to any player (especially if they have a controller hooked up but even with K/M).I can honestly say I haven't had more fun by immediately launching a game and hopping online with friends.The game is simple but fun and well worth the retail $20 pricetag.
1;Great game and superadductive. Team up with a group of friends and just have at it. Slightly mild learning curve at first but once u get the physics and the vehicles controls down the rest just comes naturally.One thing I would recommend for me using a console controller just felt a lot easier for controlling thr vehicles compared to a mouse &amp keyboard combo. I picked up a 360 usb controller got some gripit's to put on the joysticks and been loving it ever since!!
1;Rocket League What else is there to be said?Pros +Simple yet addicting gameplay that only gets more fun as you master its mechanics+Easy to pick up and put down if you have a few minutes+Consistent content updatesNeutral &gt Gamepad required (IMO) Keyboard and mouse users are welcome to have at it&gt Lack of game modesCons Horribly toxic community PSN cross platform Reporting players is basically useless (unless you provide extensive proof)
1;While it has a steep learning learning curve Rocket League a vehicular sports game that resembles soccer is a great game. PROS Eyecatching graphics Great gameplay One of a kindCONS Quite difficult The community can sometimes be but most games are like that. Becomes a bit repetitive.
1;For all those that enjoy devising strategic solutions while under pressure as one engages in a battle of wits that will surely adapt oneself to a setting that may always prove unpredictable challenging and may also trouble many whom possess addictive personalities as they spiral downwards with an addiction that puts so many drugs to shame that this game might as well be illegal.
1;First game that I...100% ed x2Bought 2 times (PS4)Bought all DLC's x2Played for more than 250 hoursPlayed on my new GPUPlayed online multiplayer (I'm a single player person) that's saying a lot right there if you can't find something in this game you like there is something wrong with you even if it's just the music
1;Lots of fun quick online matches puts you right into the action. Pretty easy learning curve but hard to master. Definitely would recommend for when its on sale. Doesn't feel like a complete enough game for a full retail game though. Either way I'm enjoying it a lot.
1;A lot of fun to play with friends and totally worth the 20 dollars. I would recommend using a controller with this game since it makes it way better to control your car but the controls are nice and easy to learn. If you're looking for something to play with your friends this is a good game to get.
1;Cars with rockets playing soccer what's not to love. The price point of this game seemed high until I played the game. It's super fun and casual and I have gotten a lot of play time out of it. Even if I'm losing or playing poorly I rarely get salty when playing this game. Fun to just chill and relax while playing with friends. Of course there is also a growing competitive scene with a high skill cap.
1;Very fun game some people don't like it after a while but I enjoy this game a lot and I think that it will go very far. It's fun alone but it's even more fun with friends because then you can communicate and strategize the field. Overall I think it was worth the 20 dollars. )
1;Addictive game. Great gameplay servers are typically good the business model has gotten worse with time. Putting cars in the crates is obnoxious although I'm sure it brings more money in. Hopefully they're working on a new game as one can only be a one trick pony for so long even though it's an incredibly COMPELLING one trick pony.Protip turn off crates in settings before you're even tempted. You can buy plenty of better things than $1.50 CHANCES at cosmetic items.
1;I hate football but love Rocket League. It's a awesome game to play with friends or with randos. Definatly worth it even at full price. You can rankup from Rookie to Pro to Veteran etc. It's always funny when your pwning someone who is higher rank.I recommend this game to anyone.
1;Th1s G me is like a wh33l man with a dash of WHAT A with ball man that will Bl0w Mindss AND lycarily infuse Nikun to eat poo poo also MAH mixtape 'D4nceKu$h' feat TIMMY a b01 band front man that was established in 1999 TIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEH but in all seriousness YALL SHUD V1S1T MAH SOUNDCLOUD 'Ku$h did 911' this will lyrically blow ur poo poo out of nikuns mouthhole
1;Hit kick and fly your way through the fun action packed high pacing game of RL. Car soccer? Really? Yes that s right and it works. You can play casuals and have tons of fun by yourself or with a group of friends. But if you want to play competitive well you will realize how much you suck at the game. With free map updates and good server support this game is a definite grab for your library.
1;I love this game so much. But there are still some things I would love to see in the game.Car designs It would be so much easier for me to change my car designs if I would be able to save my setups. Being able to have different patterns for different teams.I would be so happy if you would add these things to the game )
1;This is definitely some of the best $20 I have ever spent. Huge player base right of the start and has a huge competitive capacity! I definitely couldnt recomend this game more the only negative I have encountered so far is limited customization on car parts. Though maybe that will come.11/10 Car Explosion SimulatorDefinitely Pick This Game Up!
1;This is the first game to get me excited about playing in many years. There is something so teeth clenchingly fun about rocket powered soccer cars. I lean left and right and forward along with my car sort of like how you lean when you play Wii Bowling.Honestly just get this game. Even at full price you won't regret it. It's honestly the most replayable game I've ever owned and my life is better for me playing it.
1;What more can I say that hasn't been covered a 1000 times before? Easy to pick up and get involved but nearly impossible to master. This game is addictive engaging and a blast with friends. The competitive scene is massive and microtransactions are cosmetic only. The only true downside for me is the toxic community. If it bothers you to see childish racey and disrespectful remarks simply disable text chat and keep voice to your party only through discord or another service.
1;I honestly can't say anything negative about this game. I can wholeheartedly recommend it throughout on all aspects. The servers are well established and allows cross play from PS4 and PC. The mechanics in the game are flawless and I see no bugs. This game has A TON of potential for ups for sick moments and for hilarious moments. You won't regret buying this game whether you're alone or a group.
1;This game is very well optimized and it works even on a weak PC. I am playing it on Very High and it works very well and i have just an ATI Radeon HD 6790.It is very fun and you willl never be bored to play a match. The most interesting part is that you can play/troll with your friends so it is a very funny game. Recommended
1;The guy who created the concept to this game must be a no s giving genius! Cars playing football why the not??So addicting has got me 400 hours until this exact moment of both joy and frustration always learning new techniques and tactics to become better and better.Multiplayer with friends or going all solo this game is amazing. 10/10
1;Rocket League is quite the good game. Who knew that rocket cars flying around in an arena casually blowing each other up and hitting balls could be so exhiliarating? When I first got this game I thought it was cool but didn't think I'd spend 200+ hours on it and yet here I am. What an amazing deal this game was and will be as I play more and more of this fun game.
1;This is one of those games that is generally awesome. Like the old cart racing + fighting games. It takes minutes to play and a very long time to master. I'd recommend anyone who likes driving games of any kind to give Rocket League a try. Watch some videos of others playing and decide for yourself.
1;Amazing games are those that are the first thing you think about when you wake up and is the last thing that you think about when you go to sleep. Rocket League is one of these amazing games. It has really cool features such as car customization and multiplayer. There is nothing that I can really think about that can fault this game. I definitely recommend this game to everyone. Thanks.
1;Cars. Cars and balls. Cars and balls and rockets. Cars and balls and rockets adn goals. GOOOOOOOOALS! Seriously though this game is fantastically addictive and is one of those titles that you'll find yourself loading up for a couple minutes just to play a round or two before leaving the house for the day. Awesome game play with solid graphics for the genre however you really do need a controller in order to play the game properly so keep that in mind before buying.
1;This is probably the best game I have ever played I'm hooked. Its competetive mode doesn't take nearly as much time as say CS GO or LoL and it's perfect for eSports. A player who has never played or heard of the game can easily watch and understand a tournament where very good players are competing. (Unlike games such as LoL) Even when you think you're really good there's always someone who discovers another hard and useful thing to know. 11/10 would post this review again
1;Plusses The controls are tight and the gameplay is deep the graphics are slick the music is bumpin' and the game is fun.Minuses The community is not as friendly as it could be not a lot of content or story. Other notes There is paid DLC but it is tastefully done. The mechanical skill required is difficult for newcomers but rewarding to learn.
1;What is there to say? This is probably one of the greatest all around games ever created. It's probably the most fun approachable multifaceted time consuming watchable games ever. No doubt. If you're actually reading this and you have not purchased Rocket League do it now and you won't regret it. Unless... by regret it... you might regret all of the time you'll lose as you sink your life into this game.
1;One of the best games I've ever played. The developers are great and add all sorts of stuff to the game free of charge. One of the few games where I will pay for cosmetic DLC just to support the makers. Rumble is chaotic fun this game just keeps getting better and better.
1;One of the best games I have ever played. The 5 minute game length makes it perfect for when you want to take a break inbetween working sessions. It's easy to play but hard to master which means it has a very high skill ceiling. You can play for hundreds of hours and still have a lot to improve. Remember to keep your camera locked to the ball and only switch when you are going to turn back and get the boosts!
1;hate football gameshate car gamesLOVE rocket leaguegreat game to play with friends or alone to pass time or even get sucked into.there is always new tricks or tactics to learn and always a way to be done over by the other team very challenging at times but in a way to push you on to become a better playerthis game is like a really hot girl with an STD really bad for you but you cant help but come back for more
1;I love it its fun and so addictive when you score wether its just a normal shot to an arial goal. its friendly most of the time people get salty if you miss now and again but it took a while for me to experiance that side of the game. overall great game and fun gamemodes.
1;Hands down the best $20 I've ever spent on a game. Don't even hesitate to buy! Only takes a few mins to get the hang of before you can play PVP but having months of skill will still pay off. This is one of those games where you can play for years and still enjoy it. Beautiful polished and fun for any age.
1;"""This game is fun to play with friends! You could bump into their big butts and steal all their goals to prove your friendsip is real! D Other than that you could also fly like a butterfly to make your friends feel jelly of you. And also don't forget to """"HAHAHA"""" at your friends when they missed the ball XD"""
1;I would have paid $20 just to have the original on PC. This is a straight improvement over the original with more content on top of the amazing gameplay. I regret not purchsing this at launch. If you have played the original or just plain enjoy fun this title will blow your mind.
1;Very fun game. Pros Easy to learn but hard to master. Great e sport potensial. Great community Fun both alone and with friends. Unranked and ranked multiplayer. Good servers and good conectivity Cons None i can think of after 46 hrs ingame.Do i recommend it Oh yeah. I think this is a very fun game.
1;I've only logged 14 hours at this point but so far i absolutely love this game. Now i know this is my personal opinion and that everyone may not feel the same. The simple tuth here is that if you like a game that features intense competition then you will love Rocket League. That is unless you're some kind of wierdo ).Edit After 100+ hours i can now say that this is the best competitive multiplayer ever! Buy it now )
1;5 mins games (plus overtime if needed) and about 1 min to start the game and find a match. Brilliant game cant get enough of it. Servers are a little dodgy at the moment but they say they are working on it as they didnt expect the game to be so popular which is fair enough )
1;This game...is really good! I love this game so much it's really fun to play with friends and pretty simple when you think about it...but good graphics I love the backrounds on the arena they look like they have so much work put in to them. I'd suggest you get this game.
1;If you haven't purchased this game by now you're wrong especially with the steam summer sale going on currently. This is a great game with a tremendous amount of replayability. The concept of the game is quite simple however mastering it is nearly impossible. Psyonix is continously releasing DLC and updates tailored exactly to what their fans want. There is also a great eSports league dedicated to this game which is incredibly fun to watch. tl dr BUY IT!
1;This game is a great game. The only problems i have encountered have been the fake ranks that people have. i.e. rocketeers making rookie accounts to win more games and people using fake accounts and leveling up faster. Other than that it's a good game 11/10 would recommend.
1;Started playing RL at my ps4 the game was a free playstation plus deal that month. Great game so I bought it some months later on my PC! Still enjoy playing it and there are still point to improve myself that's also what keeps me playing. Nice to play with friends and solo is do able because the community is very nice. Nice dlc system not expensive and not pay to win but it adds a lot to the game.
1;"""This game is a game worth trying out it's loads of fun and very addictive. It can be played both for fun and competetively. There is quite a bit of skill in this game and there'll be moments where you'll be """"WOW I MADE THAT SHOT"""".Seriously worth every penny."""
1;its an amazing game and I have some suggestions to improve the game in my opinion as listed below 1 adding mini map.2 switch to turn on/off infinite boost in training mode.3 team training with switch for infinite boost.thank you and enjoy this amazing game with friends and experience the adrenaline rush
1;Cool gaem. Simple premise executed well. Fast matchmaking fun to play by yourself or with your crew.The one problem I can recall is that controls are kind of lacking for PC version (peasants' fault as always). For instance there's still no acceptable mouse look implemented (although it might be planned).
1;"""Rocket League Because """"Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars 2"""" was too long.Seriously though this game is amazingly good fun with a few friends. I own it on PS4 and PC and can honestly say best multi platform game purchase I have ever made.Solid 10/10 from me."""
1;"""Rocket League pfft I see Rocket League like Randy Orton """"Watch out watch out RKO out of nowhere"""". As this spectacular game comes out of the blue and for me and others stuns with it easy handling and basic system but with some additional skills can make some amazing goals."""
1;I can't believe how much fun this game is. It sounds stupid when you describe it to people but I simply can't stop playing Rocket League it's soooo much fun. Great game to kill a few minutes enjoy split screen with friends take way too seriously or for a hilarious night with some buddies.
1;Rocket League is a very polished game. I've been playing it since the Alpha and it has far exceeded my expectations for a game that is only about scoring goals. The devs keep pushing out solid content and the competitive scene keeps growing. If you are looking for a game that is a blast all around I recommend Rocket League.Pros Competitive Fantastic devs Good community Great content for the priceCons Steep learning curve Crate System is hit or miss.
1;Really fun and addicting game. It is easy to learn but hard to master.I think it is easier to use a controller but I enjoy learning to play it with just a keyboard.Soccer + cars Usually I am no big fan of either but in this game I think they combine just fine.I think it is totally worth every penny!
1;It's a fun game that you should play with friends. This game is really fun so here are some pros and cons +fun+addictive+cars+great graphics+many customizations+challenging at times+both offline and online bad connections sometimes addictiveGreat game!9/10
1;"""Product received for free. Buddy of mine bought this for me after weeks of begging to play with him. At first I was like """"nah.""""Now I just gotta ask why you're reading reviews instead of scrolling up and hitting """"add to cart.""""One of the best multiplayer games of all time!"""
1;"""Regarding value of your money you get a lot. This game is on discount nearly every sale so I d look for that if you re interested. Quick matches with or without friends offer tons of fun. Classic """"only 5min longer mum!"""" feeling made this game one of my most played games in my library. Recommended!"""
1;Best game I have ever been addicted to. I don't usually write reviews because I play a lot of games. But this one deserves it as it is by far the best game I have played. It has a experience like no other game. And it is hard to explain but it's like getting injected with adrenaline and running wild waiting on a outcome and sitting on the edge of your seat just to see your team win or lose. Love it great job Psyonix!
1;This game is one of the few that i have put my time into.When i first heard of this game a year ago i immediately bought it and began playing together with a few friends.this game has a great community and an easy learning curve. Like any other multiplayer game there still exists salty players which are trying to destroy the community.It has a nice and easy learning curve but it takes a long time to master.so i would rate this game 9/10.
1;"""The first description of this game that was given to me was """"It's like soccer only with Hot Wheels."""" I was skeptical at first. But after playing a few games with a friend who had this game I've been playing ever since.You can play casually or competitively. You can customize every aspect of your car. But best of all you can do a flying dunk into the goal and then fly away in style. This has become a go to game for me. 10/10."""
1;Warning! Things tend to get loud when you play Rocket League do not buy this game if you have any of the following a) An unstable internet connection with terrible pingb) An unstable room mate with crippling anxietyc) An unstable neighbour who works too much 9/10
1;"""It's like a drug. You first try it and are like """"hmm. This ain't too bad."""" Then you try it again and again and again. Soon you're addicted. You need it. You have got to have it. It ruins your relationships because all you can think about is this drug. All you can do is this drug. This magnificent nasty life ruining drug called Rocket League. Probably need to open up a rehab center just for Rocket League. I highly recommend it. Best game I've played in years. 420/10 IGN blaze it."""
1;"""When you first buy the game it is HILARIOUS because you suck so bad but once you have played quite a few hours you can ariel and such then you start getting competitive. Every game is different. Amazing goals and saves really get you going along with those long overtimes that last FOREVER. And you must know there will ALWAYS be """"that one"""" teammate who you will hate. (or love if he will be on the opposing team)I have spent over 100 hours on this game and it has not gotten old. 10/10"""
1;I've never written a Steam review before in all my years......until now.It looks fantasticIt sounds fantasticIt plays smooth as butter whether you're in online matches or notIt's one of the funnest video games I've ever played. Period. And I'm picky. I've been begging my friends all day to buy this game. It's just ridiculous and insane fun.
1;You hate the game you love the game.It's so much fun everyone is equal so it's a really competitive game. It will feel random in the lower ranks but the game requires and rewards skill the higher and better you get.Free updates and paid cosmetics seems fair.The only thing I want is cross platform parties to play with my friend who is a console pleb )
1;Some of the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. Fun by yourself or with friends. Nothing more satisfying than flying all the way accross the field in a rocket powered van. Very competitve feel to it but also is very fun if you're just playing it casually. Cross platform compatibility with PS4 makes it even better so there are more people to play with.Highly recommended and worth the $20.
1;Soccer with cars that sounds dumb Il just play FIFA. How wrong I was I held out far too long on this Game. When I finally bought Rocket League it has become one of my all time favorite games. Quick matches make it easy to fit in a quick game but like any quick game the time passes fast as you keep saying one more game.
1;&gt Playing ranked. &gt Trying to get my first aerial goal. &gt Do aerial freestyle into the goal with 0 seconds left to tie the match for OT. &gt Celebrating for epic win and goal. &gt Other team gets an epic save. &gt Lose match. &gt get demoted from elite to challanger. &gt Ragequit.pdf&gt 11/10 IGN would get game tying aerial goal stolen again.
1;"""Very well made game it has a huge variety of ways to """"complete your goal"""" the graphics are brilliant the gameplay is smooth. The only issue may be the occassional disconnect with servers but it definitely does not outway the excitement and replay value of this game. Could play for hours without getting bored... and if I didn't have to work ( 10/10"""
1;This game continually gets better with each update. It runs extremely well and has short fun games to play against people. Also the constant drops of free hats sprays and trails make the game even more rewarding to play. Highly reccomend this game to any person who likes racing/ competitive games.
1;This game is A M A Z I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!When I first got into the game I was sure it was going to be hard. But after you get the basics there is no limit for what you can do.Pros Endless tactics to score goals together as a team Entertaining gameplay All upgrades are just visuals Graphics are GREAT ! Upgrades for the cars are very nicely designed and it has some really funny ones too! wubba lubba dab dab Cons I actually couldn't find any.2139123712890730921310/10 would play again.
1;This Game is all about Timing..... and mastering the Games mechanics! Your Task is very simple...get the Ball into the Goal preferrably in the Opponents Goal. At first it can be very frustrating but when you are familiar with the controls it is one of the best Game s you will ever play.
1;Rocket League. Rocket. League. I love Rocket League. Like other people love heroin or affordable mating professionals. It s you up it makes you scream but you will always come back for more because when it hits you it feels soooo good. even after hundreds and hundreds of hours.15min overtime backwards turtle poolshot goal. gg ez.
1;The game is very addicting... I spent all night yesterday playing it and already went from lvl 0 12 due to the combination of my favorite things European Football and cars (RC cars in this case i guess). DEFINETLY WORTH THE PLAY IF you don't have a job....cause you'll forget you ever had one P
1;I really had no interest in this game despite having friends and family telling me I should play it. Finally became available for a free weekend I played for 5 minutes and purchased it.The assumption was it was simply a driving game but it's far more and quite more entertaining than expected.
1;One of my favorite games in a long long time.Very simple rules very simple inputs very interesting concept. It's soccer in a car that can fly.The fun in this game comes from how much can be achieved using the easy to pickup but impossible to master control you have over your car.To me it produces the feeling of playing Hockey / Soccer combined into videogame form. And it costs 20 dollars. I have payed that to get 1.5 hours of icetime. Buy this game
1;After playing this game for about a 1000 hours I can say that this is the game I've enjoyed the most per hour out of any game I've ever played. Only times I've ever not enjoyed playing Rocket League are caused by other people. But on the other hand all the time I've enjoyed and had hilarious games were with my friends in this game.
1;So much fun... the developers are brilliant!If you have a house that you can't scream or cheer out loud then this isn't the game for you! We play as a team of between 2 4 people and are always so loud that each of our respective family members have gotten upset! I hope that the developers can offer free counseling and gifts when necessary!
1;I almost died while playing this game... NO JOKE!The game was starting so I started rushing and took a huge gulp of coke and then next thing I know I started going dizzy and passed out for like one second on the floor this game is ING HARDCORE! BUY IT!
1;Theres not too much praise you can ever give this game.I would like to see in the future Customized chat commands to ie. change great pass to nice play ect.Make the goalposts transparent when at certian angles in the net your entire screen is black and you are effectivley useless.Other than that couldn't ask for more!
1;SUCH a fun game. In a growing E sports community this game continues to add the coolest customization new cool maps and the RLCS tournaments just keep getting better and better. The prize pools just keep getting bigger and bigger too. I cant recommend this game to enough people.
1;This is an all time favorite for me. the graphics are insane and the gameplay itself is just phenomenal and this game has hours and hours of replayablility. and to top that off the soundtrack is perfect for a game like this. also if your a total scrub at games dont worry you unlock an item after every game you play.
1;It's a very fun game. You can play with friends or random people. Games are set at 5 minutes but you tend to end up spending hours in one sitting. The basis of this game is amazing with how the game runs and the casual and competitive side to it.Also how could you say no to cars &amp rockets?!
1;The game is pretty simple and is hella fun. Eiter playing solo or with your friends you can expect hours and hours of fun without getting bored.Graphics are very good gameplay is simple and to the point and the soundtrack is really good!I think they still can improve the matchmaking experience a bit but they're always improving the game so i expect this game to be one of the most played on Steam. Top 5 maybe!9/10
1;Rocket League is a game dedicated to either team composition or strategic plays (either on your own or with others) and making sure your team is the best and rising to the top. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyonr looking for a game dedicated to teamwork!
1;Best game to play with your friends win cool items cool cars.The amazing reaction and scream you give your friend when make a sick pass and he makes a sick freaking goal this game is gold.Who tought cars and football would go well in a game? Well these guys did and they nailed it.
1;Awesome game really enjoyable as a begginner extremely challenging as you go up the ranks. Love the soundtrack and gameplay great for having a bit of fun with your friends. Ranked queues are quite engaging if you want to become the (very) best. Community is not salty (yet?) which is already better than most competitive esports' communities.
1;Soccer is boring. Soccer with cars is boring. But soccer with cars with rocket engines and the ability to climb walls and fly is amazing. Also incredibly addictive. Every match lasts 5 minutes so it's basically just highlights of a longer match.Rocket League is also easy to learn and get into but really hard to master.If you have friends that you like playing co op games with I strongly recommend this even if you don't care about soccer at all.
1;I Love this game so so much D Its great fun and there's all sorts of cool techniques to learn and master. There is never an end to how good you can get and in this game it is clear that practice makes perfect. Good satisfying intense friendly great to play with friends fun game D
1;If you like Driving a car and smashing it into an object from playing soccer you will love this game. It is driving and soccer combined into one to make a smashtastic soccer match. Throw your car at the ball to basically do anything in a regular soccer match stealing shooting ect. I highly recommend trying it because of all the combination aswell
1;This game make me go good I am never toxic and is like good game with me. Everybody like when they play against me it is like great fun. It is like non stop fun with this game. 1v1 is great to see how much you suck and it is really nice. Very gud nice.
1;This game is truly special its one of the best multiplayer experiences you can find anywhere. Whether its through the excellent split screen or online I've spent hours and hours at a time playing this with friends. Its extremely fun to attempt to master the intricacies and difficult aerial skills that go along with higher level play as well such that even though you may have started playing with friends for fun you'll find yourself coming back to it again and again.
1;Very competetive and endless amounts of fun. Having both regular and competative makes playing this game challenging and fun of your choice. I love the amount of varieties of cars you could pick from and how you could change it. You never find a car that looks the same as the last. Definitley recomend it to anyone looking for a non expensive game that is both challenging and fun.
1;Do you like strapping high explosive rockets to your backside in an attempt to gain that impercetable edge in competitive sports? Do you enjoy hydraulic equipped lowriders capable of flinging themselves gloriously skyward before succumbing to the inevitable embrace of Sir Isaac Newton's cruel overbearing guidance? Can you work out multivariable calculus based force vectors in your head in fractions of a second? Do you have a fetish for hats?GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!
1;day 3hunna i am hopelessly addicted to rocket league. i've begun to do flips around my house hoping i can hit some sweet shots. there is no ball though. nothing is real. except rocket league that is very real. we are rocket league you are rocket league this is rocket league. i bow in submission.
1;I love this game. My only complaint is that Aquadome that snowy map and Starbase arc are very laggy. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that has a good computer and 20 dollars. I bought it like 7 months ago and it has changed my life. I have already spent over 550 hrs on this game and hope to spend many more.
1;Never played the original but i can say that from what i have played and how much fun i keep having online and offline if you like competive and fun games just give it a try. ive had loads of fun with this and am looking forward to new maps and additions.
1;Very awesome game!The only thing that I don't like about it is that in the menus while using a controller you still have to deal with the cursor which is kind of annoying. Any way to get rid of the cursor entirelly? Also the lock on the ball button seems kind of lagging for me when i use my xbox controller since sometimes i cannot innitiate it or get out of it? I actually have to press the spacebar on my keyboard.
1;I myself have enjoyed nearly every FIFA and racing game there has been. So what do you get when you put it together? This masterpiece! A strange concept done flawlessly included features that I have always dreamed of. The game is beautiful and the sound effects as well. And of course you can fly making the game infinately more amusing and exciting.
1;Very fun and super addicting. Low learning curve makes it fun to play right away without to much of a hassle of learning the controls. There is also many layers of depth and complexity that will challenge an experienced gamer. The servers are great and I really love the fact that one is able to play with Playstation users!9.5/10
1;"""As a fan of football (Soccer for all the people who are wrong) and cars this game is just the best dream come true.With nice graphics awesome physics the amount of customisation Rocket League is plainly manic fun especially with friends! If you don't have any buy this game anyway you loner!""""A dream we all have had come real!"""" 15/15"""
1;Some people say they don't like soccer games or car racing games but they love Rocket League and it's easy to see why! Easy to get into but hard to master! It has become one of my recent favourite games to play and its even better when yopu play with mates.
1;Driving the rocket cars is by itself an enjoyable experience. The game has tight controls combined with a nice learning curve where you constantly learn new ways to better bend the vehicle to your will.Combine this with a very compelling game of soccer a thriving community and an excellent and responsive dev team. Rocket league deserves all the accolades it gets and more.
1;I really did not think I would enjoy this game. But this has been a few hours of enjoyment. A really enjoyable game in single player just trying to get my moves down. Not sure if I would enjoy MP but coop is something else I'm sure I can enjoy with my steam friends! A great game and BEA UTIFUL graphics. A must have for anyones that enjoys kicking some and wining!!!
1;If you're thinking of playing this game just remember these three things 1. Everyone else is trash you're clearly superior make sure you let them know it. 2. This isn't a team game go after every ball have zero faith in you're teammates to do anything of use. 3. Wasteland is 5 mins of you're life you're never getting back.
1;Probably one of the most fun games I've played in a while. Soccer with rocket cars is quite the idea. Pretty awesome that it's cross platform able. At least with the playstation 4. Anothe cool feature is plugging two controllers in gives you the option to do split screen. 10/10
1;Rocket League is always fun to hop in to a quick game. It is easy to play and challenging to master.I love the simplicity of the controls but depth of strategy. I recommend this game because everyone should experience the joy of making the perfect shot.
1;Why the hell are you reading this go and buy it for god sake. This game is the It's fast paced competitive and a tonne of fun. Your hours will waste away playing this and you won't even notcie. Already sunk in 57 hours. So what are you waiting for there are games to be won!
1;Rocket League is the game that you dream about. Cars and football two brilliant time wasters in one game with good multiplayer functionality there is some lag in places but idk if that is me or the serever. Defo Buy. Good with friends (If you have any)
1;Football is good.Racing cars is good.Destruction derby is good.Rocket league is all those and more.The only negative I've experienced to this game is the servers for competitive gameplay being slightly unforgiving towards those who have slow connection issues (despite perfectly fine gameplay).
1;Amazing game very well polished and I have not yet seen one cheater on this game. It's worth your money. This is my first ever review that I thought is 100% worth typing down for hands down one of the best games I've played that'll really keep you interested for a long time (especially if you like soccer).
1;Why are you reading these reviews while you can be playing this game?Why are you still readin buy the game already and download it.Seriously stop reading and play the game already.You already know you're interested in the game so what are you waiting for?Meanwhile why you reading this someone else is getting better than you at this game.While you were reading this your possible future teammate is crying about hie horrible teammates.10/10 Everything about this game
1;"""Rocket League is one of those games where you pick it up say """"this is fun"""" then proceed to play it some more till you realize that you suck practice some more still suck practice even more and learn sorta how to hit the ball suck even more learn how to fly and 50 hours later you still suck but its still fun.10/10 would fail again"""
1;4 Way Splitscreen? Check.Crossplay with both PS4 and Xbox? Check.DLC's that don't give you an unfair advantage and arereasonably priced? Check.Cars? Check.Football/Soccer? Check.Matches that don't take too long? Check. CSGO Good Matchmaking? Check.A (nearly) non toxic community? Check. Dota 2 Shhh Don't tell anyone!10/10.
1;This game is simultaneously one of the most enjoyable and most difficult games I've ever played. It's fun because it's very easy to get the hang of and have a good time but it's difficult to master. It's quite the addiction. Online or offline. Simple concept executed very well.
1;Cars! Rockets! Soccer! Also featuring Flying! Hitting! Shooting! Scoring! Saving! Even more fun than the gameplay videos make it look. You must get this game. It's so much fun.Update 2016 11 26 Rocket League has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of uniting gamers across the platform divide. Xbox PlayStation and PC players alikee all love the game and it's easy to see why once you play a few rounds. Easily the most unique memorable and fun games of the last few years.
1;"""One of the best games in recent years.Oh how i thought to myself when buying this that it's going to be hilariously stupid and waste of money... But who would have thought that after 50+ hrs i would find myself to be completely absorbed in the game.Also what i like about the company is when they release a DLC everyone gets something even if you don't buy it.Update Also this game is the embodiment of """"Just 5 more minutes!"""" steam awards categoryUpdate 2 Steam awards!"""
1;Overall a very good game it has good gameplay and fps is good considering i play on a MacBook air. There's more to it than the actual game there's ranked matches and season as well as a massive trading market. The only flaw is that some servers can be quite slow but it's still a great game.
1;10 Reasons to buy the game Great Game Nice Game ing sick game amazing game still reading this ? very nice game didnt push the purchase button yet ? what the are you waiting for ? buy it NOW . Stunning Game GGIF YOU DON'T LIKE THE GAME . Uninstall steam pls23/11/2017 GREAT GAME DID THIS FOR THE STEAM BADGE
1;The skill floor is so high that I trip so hard every time I play this game. Worth its megabytes in csgo keys.1 70h Just run into the ball.80h Time to man up and do aerials.150h Wall shots and broken controller! I regret assigning my boost to right bumpGet it!
1;Simply a good game. Only negative things are that the score counting doesn't work as well as it should leaves assists &amp saves unnoticed and rare network errors (you are in a party with a friend and only the host starts to look for the match).Awesome waste of time doesn't get on your nerves so badly.
1;It's the best sports game ever made...and they don't sell a new version of it for $60 every year like EA. So yeah that's nice. Also the DLC's are fun but not necessary so no pay to win crap exists. Bonus points for adding new maps for free. Coolest Dev's ever. Its a game you have to play.
1;Seriously one of the best games on my list. It's a very nice game to play competitive but also to just have some fun. The game also has very nice DLC but is not needed to be the best at this game. Has nice extra gamemodes like Hoops now.Just Buy! (you can always refund if you didn't like it P)
1;"""Honestly this has been one of the best games I have picked up in a long time. It is super enjoyable to play with your friends and you will catch yourself saying """"One more game. Just one more game."""" all the time. While playing online with people can be super frustating because of how toxic some players can be occasionally you will run into some really nice people that are just a joy to play with. I would highly suggest getting this game."""
1;*Updated Review*With this many hours into this game I will certainly say that this is one of the best purchases I have made in a LONG time. It's car soccer/football... a SIMPLE concept that is PERFECTLY executed. While it does have a learning curve with flying/doing aerials the game is very fun. The vehicle customization is also quite nice.It's an absolute blast with friends the community is decent and is a game you can't miss.
1;I enjoy playing the game but I have only one problem... I can't play online at all because the servers in my area make me teleport all over the map and I cant play at all even though my internet connection is good.. Gameplay is 10/10 hands down but in terms of online playabillity on a decent pc? 8/10.
1;This game will go down in history as one of the great indie games. Would def kick a spiked ball carrier in the face. I laughed so hard I cried when rumble came out. The devs do a great job updating the game and constantly releasing new content.The Cons...They need to clean up the skins system. It's a hot mess right now. Would also like to see better match making in casual so you're not put into a game that's six to one.
1;It seems insane to say but this weird little car soccer game is possibly the purest expression ever of what actually playing sports is in video games. It's the Oxford Dictionary's definition of Just 5 More Minutes. It's yelling out a window for a stranger to come and watch the replay of what just happened. It's laughing uncontrollably even though you just lost and demanding to play again. The cars have hats.You need to own this game.
1;"""This is one of those games that pleasantly surprise. I waited for a sale and took the chance. Very glad I did.You will find that time just passes by while you have loads of fun.Soccer """"football"""" with cars. The guy who thought of this is a genius.Just one more game ... ) ... can't stop. Just another ..."""
1;100% must buy. Game is highly addicting and is great for anyone whether you like football or not. Only wish is that the devs set up official group stage and knockout tournaments at some point in time for people of all skill levels. Despite that once you get in the game it'll be hard to get out.
1;So addictive I played this game and thought I would give it a go for fun for about 30 minutes and 4 hours later was still playing it trying to improve my game. I have now owned this game for a few months and still play this nearly everyday.I am still trying to improve my game as I am getting better slowly* *Yes Slowly ha ha ha. Excellent game and highly recommended as different from other sport and racing games.
1;This game is so much fun I haven't had this game for too long but I still love it. I have spent lots of time on it and have enjoyed every second. I would most definately recommend this game. I don't even like driving games or football games so this would be a horrible combination for me. But it's actually amazing. It is nothing like you would expect.
1;This is the first review I've ever posted for anything and let me tell you this game is worth every single penny. This is the only game I play constantly and I do not regret any minute that I've spent into this game. 10/10 would recommend to play this game especially now with the new DLC approaching!
1;I'll just explain it how it happened for a few of my friends. Someone tells you about rocket league you think it sounds lame you try it anyway you have 50 hours logged in 2 weeksI actually like hockey better than the regular game though. It's easier and I suck so I love easy.
1;GREAT GAME. BUY IT. ARE YOU STILL READING THIS?!? GO F*CKING BUY IT YOU BUFFOON. YOU STILL HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT. Well then I just have three simple words for you sir.GO.F*CKING.BUY IT.That was four words you say. Well you're the one who's still reading this when you SHOULD HAVE F*CKING BOUGHT IT BY NOW. SO QUIT READING THIS AND BUY IT.
1;This game has ruined my life in the best way possible. I've owned it for only 4 days and have logged over 25 hours! It is addictive and fun and paired with the steam link in my dorm the fun never ends! The only problem I have is that we yell so loud when playing we got a noise complaint.10/10 would aerial again!
1;Are you bored of FIFA and constant EA BS? Have you ever wanted to fly cars and play soccer at the same time? Or just take flying bicycle kicks to the next level?! Don't lie you potato! You want to! Divisions! Seasons Ranked Server Lag (Okay maybe EA and Psyonix have this in common....... BUT its less laggy....?) Physics like no other BOOOOOOOOST Flight (Some skill required) AddictiveGet it you dum dum!
1;This game is awesome it is very fun and addictive ! I first played this game on console and now I decided to buy it on steam and it is even better ! This game is just great and competitive too ! It is one of the best games at the moment and for me one of the best games ever ! This game is a must have for gamers !
1;i can't tell you how jazzed i get when i pop this game in by then i'm just drunk as all heck and just smiling hella big at me letting it loose with that hardsteppin' rocket jumps glugging that nO2 boost nozzle and NEVER stopping until i grab all of the orbs and hit 100like imagine if this actually existed and we could drive like that in a regulated setting imagine the lives that could be saved across the world and also don't cut across you dumb shiy you'r never hitting plat
1;Extremely easy to pick up extremely hard to master. Compared to typical sports games where complicated actions are done with the press of a button Rocket League is like learning a whole new ball sport in itself where every action is based on your skill and decisions not a preset animation. It is extermely satisfying to always be able to build on your skills much like playing a real life ball sport.
1;This game is great because there are 2 amazing aspects to it. There is trading and gameplay while some games are more focused on one or the other rocket league has the perfect balance. Psyonix is great too because because they listen to the communiy's feedback and fix stuff where they need to. I LOVE ROCKET LEAGUE.
1;"""Best game i've ever played wich has online. Best way to mix up football and cars.The dlcs are extremely awese i recomend to buy them first the """"Super Sonic Fury"""" it has the Dominus(best car in the game).Psyonix well done you got my heart with that game keep working on it and updating it. Love your work."""
1;"""This game will toy with your emotions. Experience the joy of seeing your firstborn by winning a tight match in OT and endure the shame of someone noticing your sweatpant erection when you score an own goal. Matches are quick but this electronic heroin will have you playing """"one more match"""" until your eyes bleed."""
1;This is one of the best purchases I've made.I've played its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocketpowered Battlecars on PS3. I can assure you that they kept the gameplay and style the same in this new HD version.The intense and also very fun matches can keep you playing for a long while.They also added A LOT of customization options for the cars which adds nicely to the battle playfield.Overall a great game I can fully recommend. 10/10
1;Really great playing solo but game really shines when you're in a group with a friend or more.Great game definelty recommend it.The amount of kids trash talking is bad in this tho so better turn off opponents chat and voice and you'll have a good time.
1;Reasons to buy this game You can ram other people which is annoying (ask the people who are always ramming me i get annoyed)You can make other explode which is annoying (ask the people who are always blowing me up i get annoyed)You can steal boosts from people which is annoying (ask the people who are always stealing my boost i get annoyed)furthermore it's a cacophony of driving footie games flying and epic goals10/10 would get rammed again
1;Product received for free. Hi! I just want to ask you if you could make like tournaments and something like that... You guys need to make more cars who will be not premium or Import. You need make things what can be got from ranking up.Thanks!Dear RaZeDeSiGnS
1;I suck so bad a reg RL. I cant fly. Most of my goals are accidents. Im constantly hitting my teammates. I get lol'd out of the net cuz im such a bad goalie. Then I tried RL hockey.... one guy called me Gretzky during a match. 10/10 still playin hockey
1;Never been one for sports games and racing games but combine them and I love it. Overall this game is fantastic! The only issues I have are the ranking system. I seem to always be paired with the worst teammates or I'm facing someone outside my division! (Stars vs. Challengers) That is not fair at all! Fix this and the game would be perfect!
1;I was always intrigued by this game but never got around to buying it. I purchased it during the exploration sale....and MAN....where has this game been all my life?!?!? I've only owned the game maybe 3 days now and I almost have 20 hours played.......I. Can. NOT. Put. This. Game. Down. Period.EDIT after playing 50+ hours. My review still stands. Closest thing to crack that exists.
1;What is rocket league? Well rocket league is a game where Ronaldo can be car form. Whether you want to play bots in the Season mode playing competetive or just trying to make the car you have look cool Rocket League is a game for anyone. You don't have to be the best because you can become the best or just play casual. Rocket League wasted a lot of my time but I mean it was time well spent. D
1;One day Lionel Messi bought mysterious shrooms from a street side seller and consumed them. After that he hijacked Nintendo and reinvented mariokart. Days later he somehow put up the game on steam. That's how rocket league is made. m8 I'd r8 8/8 Sincerely He Man
1;Rocket League is a true masterpiece. I like cars and I like soccer but I wasn't really sure about putting them together. Then I played this. Even though I spen most of my time in this game accidentaly dodging the ball missing aerials and flying into the opposite net or corner and generally screwing up I still love the game and it feels truly fantastic when I do something useful or hit a sick aerial. Definitely worth it.10/10 Can't wait to become a competent player.
1;So... sometimes i wonder why dafak i play this game so much but then i realise that playing this game makes me want to kill myself sometimes and because of that i found a reason to live... I just didnt know what to say... this game is just to much fun to play with friends or even alone just buy it already
1;I bought Rocket League because of a friend who said that it was fun and addicting.We were mad about CSGO crappy players and cheater so i gave it a shot.Following that I proceeded to play with him and some other friends.We were so bad but laughing so much that there's no way that I could say that this game isn't awesome.
1;Why does love always feel like a Rocket League?Tight controls and engaging gameplay make it a very enjoyable experience. This is also enhanced by the fact that DanielZo0 always manages to score epic goals and Vala makes incredible saves!An xbox controller is highly recommended when playing this game but other than that just purchase the game hit up some friends and let the beyblades rip as far as I'm concerned.10/10 would buy again.
1;Soccer with rocket powered cars. Sounds stupid and it kind of is but it's also one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've ever had and I just can't stop playing. It's a simple enough premise but the skill ceiling is so high that even after hundreds and thousands of hours of playing you're still always getting better and better learning new techniques and honing your car control.Grab a few friends boot up Rocket League and you're guaranteed to have a blast. Can't recommend enough.
1;Had family? Had friends? Had a life?Now you don't.10/10 played 17 hours in the last 3 days. As another guy said it made me forget about masturbating.Seriously one of the best games I've ever played and I'm so happy to have bought it at launch. The servers acted up the first 2 days (due to the massive amount of players 90.000) but now they are stable. PICK THIS UP!
1;Realy has the potential to be one of the best games here on steam.It is very fun to play alone or with firiends while even split screeen is an option.Play it casual with friends or alone or play it competetive in rankeds.Realy amazing and fun to play even if u dont have that much time to play some days.Highly recommended!
1;tl dr + Great graphics+ Great gameplay(controller makes it easier)+ Easy to pick up and learn the basics+ Extremly hard to master+ Surprisingly nice community+ Free Patches with new maps toppings antennas &amp so on+ Publisher that listens to it's community and is really active in the community hub+ DLCs that just add new cars which you dont need because they dont give you any bonus at all addicting
1;+Great game+Challenging skill curve very rewarding if you practice a bit+Very active Developer constantly adding new features+Developing Pro scene to follow Ranking system not perfectIts just driving and flying into a ball after all but you can go incredibly deep tactically and technically
1;"""If you want to age 10 years via stress and heart palpitations buy this game. If you want to say """"I've got this win"""" then get smacked down within 30 seconds and eventually lose buy this game. If you have dreams of ariel goals and ezpz shots buy this game. Why? Because RL is love. RL is life. RL gets me up in the morning. RL puts me to bed at night. RL makes me a better husband and a better human being. Buy this game if you too wish to be a better human being. Also $20? Ez decision to buy."""
1;This game is amazing!!! I'm not the biggest fan of Car games it's one of my least favorite genre. However this game is freaking amazing from start to finish.Multiplayer is just amazing. Friends or on your own you can have an amazing time! STOP READING THIS AND BUY THE GAME!!
1;This game is so fun ive been addicted to it from the very first second!! Ive been telling all my friends about this and some of them are getting it and buying it. I recommend it to everyone who even remotely wants to play this game!!! The controls with keyboard and mouse are pretty decent but you also have the choice to use a controller. Happy playing!
1;If your in two minds this may helpPros.1. Fun2. loud3. easy4. hard5. fast6. more funCons.1. to much fun2. to loud3. to easy4. to hard5. to fast6. im late for work7. im to tired to work8. yes i know im being loud but i just scored!!9. i need a new controller!10. s**t im late for work again!!
1;Its like soccer but with cars. It is faster paced but also easy to pick up. There is a high skill ceiling which makes mastering the game difficult to do and allows for longer game play. There is also nothing else in the store like this so it is a unique experience in itself.
1;Buy the game. Play the game. Love the game. Quit your job to play the game more. Leave your wife and kids for the game. Use your unemployment to rent an unfurnished rundown studio apartment where you and the game can be together without distraction. Live out your days in bliss.
1;Went to go hit the ball in the airMissed the ball in the airTeam mate is also flyingHe missed the ball in the airHe hits me in the airI fly into the ball because im out of controlI hit the ball into our own goal10/10 would get hit by team mate and knock the ball into our own goal again
1;When my friend told me about the game I was a bit skeptical about the gameplay itself since my computer has a terrible graphics card for games however after you lower the settings to performance and you have friend to play with... THAT'S WHEN THE FUN BEGINS!! D
1;It takes a bit of time to get used to the controls when you're new to the game but once you get the basics it's all good fun! Lot's of customization options for your cars with more being added all the time.Graphics are pretty good. Music is nice (although I listen to my own during play).Would recommend this to anyone who likes football/racing type of games.
1;"""Bought this game not expecting much just car football really. When coupled with 2 3 friends however it becomes one of the funnest little games which gets you saying """"Just one more game.""""There is also a competitive scene if that floats your boat where you can beat people and get ranked on it what is not to like?I would recommend this game both casually and to a lesser extent the comp side."""
1;1. Weird! How come there are so many people playing it...2. Eh why not *buy*...3. Sh*t's hard! How come there are so many people playing it...4. Still Weird! Yet weirdly enjoyable...5. Damn brah I'm getting gud...6. Still losing most comps...7. Still weird af but now amazingly enjoyable (except when I lose) D..hope it helped!!
1;Awesome game! Fast to learn hard to master!After 1000+ hours still the number 1 game for mePsyonix doing the best game support i've known till today.the only bad thing is the community the pros are awesome and friendly but the low to mid lvl players are a pain in the if you can ignore them THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!Cars Football (soccer for the ppl who don't understand english P) tuning. Now with Basketball as well.if you don't have it get it now
1;The first day of playing was the most fun I've had with a game in quite a while. That's likely because when you start out you get matched up with rookies as well. The difficulty has significantly increased since the first day but that's not necessarily a bad thing.It's definitely a great game. Easily worth the $20. HOWEVER I would not shell out the cash if you don't have someone you can play with and communicate with whilst doing so.
1;An amazing game that will make you completely lose track of time and that also has the support of the developers and the community. The constant communication between the developers and the community regarding all aspects of the game allows this game to grow exponentially even years after release!
1;Rocket League is a really fun sports/car game!Driving a cool customized car while playing soccer basketball or ice hockey. Do I need to say more?They also do a really great job at keeping it interesting with new updates like new arena's new items and since a while those crates.No matter what kind of gamer you are You have to give Rocket League at least one try!
1;This is one of the best casual games I've ever played. Doesn't require a super powerful computer and supports split screen on PC which is a big deal for me. I love the game and all the free updates with new maps and game modes that they've been adding.
1;I like this game alot but the server issues it has now ruins the game.. the ball jumps around.. you timeout.. i was kicked for idleing while driving around.. Fix the servers(alot) Only played on EU servers.. because i want good ping.. when servers are better i will give it a yes on recommend.. but as is.. atleast for Eu servers i wouldent want anyone to buy it..
1;If you like soccers and cars this is the game for you!However it is best to play with a controller because Psyonix won't fix up the keyboard and mouse. What I mean by this is that you do not have a free look option you only have the ball cam reverse cam and the front cam. That is the only gripe I have with this game.It is still a fun game to play and I recommend it!
1;Look you're reading reviews and I get it. You just wanna know if this game is your thing. How long have you been doing this though? Let me tell you something finger that scroll wheel until you get to the top of the page like the video and stuff? That's your answer.
1;This is just an AMAZING game! With the DLC's you can buy your cars can look beastly. This game has easily become one of my new favorite games within a few days of playing the game. But there's only one problem when searching for online matches there is no Canada east/west regions _ ... Like everyone forgets about Canada a lot of the time when it comes to selecting regions in games. But still a great and super fricking fun game!
1;The game is pretty much frustrating. It is pretty hard to hit the ball from time to time especially when it's pretty high and you suck at the game.However I usually play ranked on 2v2 when I don't have any friends playing I like always meet someone to play with for the evening or even after that.The community can be toxic but the game is definitely worth playing! (I have crossplay disabled)
1;if you want to have a good time with friends or some new ones jump on rocket league. take soccer and hot wheels with rockets attached to them and you are going to have a fun time. i reccomend you play this game for endless ammounts of fun. who knows what will happen when you dive into this game
1;Best competitive game EVER!!! this game is great if you just want to kick back and mess around playing with other people as you try to get the ball into the opponents goal or you can take play competitively as you use team work to earn points for your rank
1;"""Well """"Rocket League"""" It's a special game.. we all know that is football with cars. Still this game a so much fun the """"Garage"""" is awesome to make a car just for you!2 DLC's at the moment I do like them cars are cool stickers ..I do like to game just a bit better when I play it with friend then alone."""
1;"""THE ONLY REASON I DOWNLOADED STEAM WAS FOR THIS GAME and I don't regret it at all. This game is one of my favorites. Whenever I discribe it to a friend I always start out saying """"It includes Cars Explosions (When you demolish an opponent) and soccer"""" and most of the time thats all I need to convice them. If you buy this game you will not regret it."""
1;Was expecting to fly rockets into space but for some reason I can only play soccer in my car currently. Not sure how long the story is but I'll be playing through it to hopefully get to the part of the story where I get to fly the rockets into space. The dialogue is fantastic I can tell you guys spent a good amount of time and rock hard effort into making the dialogue for the story as good as you can. Still no rockets yet.69/10
1;Very good multi player game.Funny with friends challenging when playing alone 1vs1.Pros +Ability to use controllers (also steering wheel)+Short (mainly) 6 minutes matches+Crate system+Very good game easy to play hard to masterCons Some people are very very toxic Everyone now plays game for free crates Servers sometimes crash or ping is destroying game even if you are playing on your region's server. Final grade 9+/10
1;My friends begged me for like 2months to get this game i didn't want it at first but then i liked it!once i bought this game i got vulcan streaght ahead i spent around 23hours on this game and its real fun even tho im not that much of a pro! I'm looking forward for more updates and features and im surely going to buy every single DLC car and im going to gift it to the friends that wants it this game is epic! 10/10 9/11 8/7
1;Fun as all hell just get it it is so worth. so much fun i gifted it $20 to a friend just so i could play multplayer XD graphics are greatsmooth gameplayrealistic in a way Didk how to describe it read other reviews but when you read mine take my advice. If youare considering buying this BUY IT NOW or you can eait ten years for a sale but its better to get it asap for more fun. And if you are mentally ill and dont like it just refund it its not so hard
1;Have been playing Rocket LEague for a long time both on PC and console. I enjoy how it can be a quick fix for a couple of games and can also be taken very seriously/competitively. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try something different from the general shooters or RTS games.
1;All I have to say about this game is that even with the lack of content I would still pay $60 for this game. It is a complete steal at $20. Buy this game.. Please.. You will not regret it..Edit I don't play this game as much as I used to but they added a ton of new game modes and new car customization options. Even more of a steal now than it was last year buy it now! It's on sale!
1;This game is many things. It's a highly competetive sports game a chase the ball simulator or a skin collector. However above all else it's a very well made game. It simply has no flaws. It seems like it would become repetetive but it just doesn't there are always new strategies to try or new ways to play.10/10 Astonishing game
1;Fun and complex game however out of my 73 matches i've had about 5 or so against rookies/semipros and the rest is against ing 600 hour people and this is during a ing free weekend where half the players are rookies/semipros. there is clearly no properly working matchmaking.EDIT i did my placement matches and even at bronze 1 all i'm meeting is 150 500 hour people i have yet to see a semi pro in my 15 ranked 2v2 bronze matches.
1;"""Before buying RL """"Seems like a pretty little game to play in my spare time""""Now """"Life seems like a pretty little thing to do between my RL matches""""Warning This game will take the life out of you.""""Oh man another game won't hurt it is only 5 minutes..."""""""
1;I don't always have time to play online multiplayer games with my growing number of responsibilities. Rocket League is the first game I can remember in the last 5+ years that I just can't get enough of and what's great about it is that the 5 minute matches are perfect for someone like me who can't always commit to a 45 60 minute game. Easy to understand and hard to master this game is amazing from casual splitscreen on the couch to competitive 3v3.
1;What could i say about this game that i barely know and already consider as ?Well tons of fun car explosions missing the time of the ball all included in the pack.You should definitely play this and if you got your homeboys to play with you Oh boy! You gonna have a good time baby!
1;Perhaps one of the best games ever made? Definite contendor for game of the year 2015 not that it would win or anything. But a must play no you don't need to be a racing fan or a sports fan. What you have to not be is a . If you enjoy competetive games with a skill cap that are heaps of fun this is for you.
1;What can say? It take honestly LONG WHILE to get rly good (sry 4 bad english i kinda tired just waked up) but when u get gud you honestly it feel so satisfied more than many other game. But in seriously i have EVER NEVER enjoy sport game much as much as rocket l. I rate my fav. sport gem in history of gaming PERIOD.
1;This is probaby one of the best games i've ever played I highly recommend this game! My personal experience has been great though I have spent a little to much on this game &gt ) Though it's expensive it's worth every penny! The amount of activity by the developers is awesome! I used to play a game though I forgot what it was called the developers made an amazing game but never updated it I was depressed and annoyed thats why Rocket Leagues staff is AWESOME! &lt 3
1;Product received for free. I was surprised when I saw this game in my library. Turns out I got it for pre ordering the Steam Controller (Thanks Steam). Anyways after the first matched I was hooked. It's one thing to see people play it but it's another to actualy play it for yourself. If I knew I would have this much fun I would have bought it a long time ago. Nice game Psyonix.
1;Fast easy and simply just works. Great if you have just a few minutes to game wich can just as well turn into hours of gameplay. Once the round is done you are mere seconds away from the next one. Dont need to be a FIFA fan or race driver fan to enjoy this.
1;Rocket leage is tuned perfectly for people with any skill level. You can grab your relative and let them play the tutorial once or twice and bam they now know how to play the game. and the flying bumps etc. are always an oppurtunity for any player to improve and extend their skill base.If you want to be the best jump right into Competitive. If you wanna have mad fun go for standard/special modes11/10 would teach grandma againPS grab some friends
1;Brilliant Game so so so much fun with friends casual competative just a call of laughs definitely worth the price tag. Looks very nice Plays very nice and not too intense on the computer. Smoothe and well made.The only danger is the 'just one more' attitude it brings!Enjoy!
1;At first i was skeptical...not being a sports fan and not owning a controller. A sale came along I decided to roll the dice and couldn't be happier. Great game awesome gameplay graphics options and continuous content make this all the more worth the purchase!
1;Love this game with a passion. Game always stays up to date. Developers Listen to the community 100%. Easy to pick up and play but can take some time to master. If you enjoy Soccer and You love fast cars this is for you. The DLC of new cars and new paints alwasy keep your car different from other peoples. Only thing is I'm Looking forward to maybe some arcade Game modes like (penalty shootout Dribble only mode Corner Defense) Other than that. This game is awesome and worth the 20$.
1;With the ability to finally do aerials I'm starting to play this game 24/7. Please help!I've never been so addicted to a game as this. Sometimes you get bad teammates sometimes you get amazing teammates. This game has made me enjoy football so much more than I already did &lt 3 I approve!
1;The servers have stabalized!Tons of fun to play with friends. Although it can get competetive I never once found myself getting discouraged after a loss. You can feel yourself getting better and better every game and making shots you would have previously missed. I fully recommend this game if you have at least one other person to play with. Solo is entertaining for a while but playing with &amp against the AI leaves much to be desired.Multiplayer 10/10Single player 7/10
1;When Cristiano Ronaldo meets S�bastien Loeb. A huge bunch of fun.I heard about a trading system which will be implemented soon (don't have any proof though)It's a fun game. The amazing fact is the splitscreen possibility and the Xplay (you can play on PC with people playing on PS4).Unfortunately it's quite impossible to play without a controller (or at least it's a lot easier with one).
1;The game itself is good but the community is really bad. At least for the 80% of the time. It looks like the players have forgot all the manners when somebody makes a mistake. But sometimes you have good behaving players with you. best to play with friends
1;At one point in my life I had fun playing this game.It was something to play on the weekends and to have fun with friends.But now it's something more ..It's become an addiction if you can even call it that.Now it's everday. Wake up. Play. Sleep if I have time.Competitive in this game has captured me I'll never escape.This game can both make and destroy your life.Buy at your own risk...
1;Rookie Kinda boring. You lose almost everytimeSemi pro You start to like it and you win often.Pro You have a controller now. You are a big boy. You do small aerials.Veteran First freestlye steps. You dribble and you score from the wall.From a lvl 38.10/10
1;Rocket League is one of my favorite games of all time! I have been playing soccer for 8 years now and the thought of playing soccer with cars was very appealing! I did not have very highh expectations going into it. But I have to say that I have never had a dull moment. There are some issues that could be fixed like Rookies going up against Masters and so on. But other than that I would recommend this to anyone!
1;The game is very good but unless they sort out the AFK (MORONS) who are CRATE FARMING and messing up game play BIG TIME i have reported between 30 to 50 IDIOTS as asked by PSYONIX in there news page WHY DONT YOU PUT A AFK IN YOUR REASON TO REPORT SO YOU KNOW WHY THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED.ALSO IF YOU LEAVE A UNRANKED GAME YOU CANT JOIN ANOTHER GAME FOR 15 MINS because people are AFK YOU GET PENILISED GRRRRR this behaviour should not be tolerated by paying customers SO BEWARNED
1;Very fun game well worth the money. It's really fun and best played with friends. It's probably one of the best games for relaxing and having fun with people.It's probably best played with a controller but still playable with mouse and keyboard. I definitely would suggest it to anyone that has even a mild intrest in football/soccer.
1;This game is awesome. High speed action really great multiplayer game that only takes 5 minutes. You can play with your pc against someone on the playstation. Affordable and creative. Different styles of games also. Football and basketball as well as ice hockey. This game is one I will always go back to for a quick 5 mins of fun.
1;Rocket League is a great rocket car powered soccer game. There are multiple levels to gameplay as you get more advanced. You start off playing normal soccer but it quickly turns into flying around the map scoring unbelievable goals. The controls are easy to use or configure the graphics are beautiful and there's new content added all the time.
1;Great competitive game that's fun at every ability level but has an extremely high skill cap. The community is relatively nice in game and I've made more friends in RL than any other game I've played. If you like pvp racing games soccer and or explosions this could be the game for you!
1;I have played this game and I have vanquished said game. I have fought bots throughout the ages from expert to novice I have destroyed them all.I have lost my sanity yet gained great ranks of psycopathism.I have broke used and twisted many devices to play this game if thou must play thou must get a controller.Experience is a thing that you must need to play and only and only then will you be able to master the ranks.I conclude with the finale this game is cool.
1;Amazing game!Although I suck at this game i love playing it every single second!Even when I get matched aginst players with a higher rank then Me... I still love playing it!Even when I rage cause i f****** miss an easy goal... I still love playing it!And even when I practice so much to be good and i still suck... I still love playing it!The mechanics are amazing!And I always have a good time playing with a friend!Highly recommended!
1;Amazing and competitive game! I often forget to breathe in a heat of moment. It easy to get started and hard to master. Even with 100+ hours it is tough for me to do awesome aerial shots. ( I am not so talented). It's definitely my favourite game out there!
1;"""Insanely fun to play even better with friendsjust watch out the salt is realA lot of people leave after the first or second goal..... and a lot of people say """"what a save"""" to troll you... correction they spam it. a lot...A lot of bad salty people out there but that's with a lot of games. This one just has a high % of people who are like that."""
1;Did your mother ever tell you to go play with some friends outside?!Well thanks to Rocket League you could play that one sport every one loves with your best friends even across platforms!Football/Soccer has never been so fun! Frontflip your way to victory with one of the best games this year!Although the servers are somewhat overpopulated it's worth the money!Big 'ol 10/10.
1;These days gaming studios only give a flying f*ck about how much money they can suck out of you with dlc's and micro transactions. This game however is really nice balanced no pay to win crap and is guaranteed to give you a metric ton of fun. Im gonna rate this game 9/10 and the reason for that is because the only thing this game lacks is good car customization (like for example is APB Reloaded).
1;This game will ruin your life. Everything you thought was good will no longer be good food will taste off your hair will thin and finally fall out. Your family will leave you unable to stand to watch a once proud man wither away to a lifeless husk. Every prior achievement will seem meaingless and petty unworthy of the pride you once held. Now there is only Rocket League.
1;This game is fun to play and I really enjoy playing it. This is one of the game that will be fun to play to waste your time. I dislike only that camera thing Whenever ball's up to roof and you're nearby ball the camera wont show your car... where you can do nothing but to retreat or try to guess where's your car and what maneuver to do...
1;"""This game is great. It's just plain fun. It reminds me of the kind of games you would play on a friday afternoon on your N64 and three of your buddies. It's simple and incredibly well balanced everything is a skill shot. There is no """"instawin"""" button or play that you can pull over your opponents every game you just have to try to position well and hit the ball effectively. 18/10"""
1;I have played this game for a little bit more than 24 hours and i can safely say that this is one of the best games i have bought.Probably one of the best ''easy to learn hard to master'' uses i have seen.PD You may get high ping but who cares about it. You may get rubberbanding but its not that much. I have gotten MVPs several times with 300+ ping )
1;This game includes Sreaming children Sreaming teens Screaming adults Console peasantsWhen you first start out Get matched with ppl your level have no idea wtf ur doing*Hit's level 10* Somehow get matched against Kuxir97 and he backflips quadruple touches it in.
1;I would like this game more if the devs would actually try and fix its horrible cancer servers. This can't be from my side since I dont lag in any other game. Its a good game horrible servers.P.S It literally happens in every game now. I have no clue how to fix it any longer I've done as much as i probably could. I legit don't know how I always d/c its beyond me
1;I remember saying how this game looks so boring and all then one day i got it from my friend thought he just wasted his money on me cause i surely cant like a game i called boring.....Few hours later and im attached to this amazing game never judge a book by its cover truly an amazing and fun game only con i can think of is ball hit registration sometimes you dont even see someone touch the ball and it moves but other than that simply amazing can only recommend
1;"""of course its fun (controller or bust). microtransactions rule here. Not even a discount for buying bulk not that i would. good luck getting anything rare. 51 hours and nothing. not buying keys to open random crates. get banned for any chat thats not """"i love you you are amazing."""" heaven forbid you use the IN GAME responses. Feelings are king now. Still in the end it's really fun."""
1;Been a long time since I had a game that is actually fun for months and not just for a few days.Really nice game lots of options perfectly optimized even able to activate/deactivate crossplay with PS4 players . (February 2016)Been a long time since I had a game that is actually fun for years and not just for a few days.Game is still awesome and just as fun. (January 2018)
1;Super Sonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars *cough* I mean Rocket League (Yes I know they were both made by Pysonix) is one of the best games I have ever played. For the most part the community is one of the nicest ever and the ranking system while tedious makes for hours of motivated play.
1;Very nice and polished game.Here is a hint 4 new playes at the start you will lose a lot of games but if you whait untl lvl 10 13 (rank sepi pro) you will get the hang of the game and you will start to win a lot of games. (its very easy to become a semi pro)My favorite game mode is rumbleQuick opinion EASY 2 LEARN HARD 2 MASTER
1;"""I find it almost hard to believe that I put off getting Rocket League as long as I did. """"Rocket powered cars playing soccer?"""" I thought """"I will never enjoy this nor be any good at playing it"""". Even after purchasing it I thought I'd refund it within the 2 hour window.Now 1000+ hours in this is the game I turn to every day for a quick couple of rounds (that then turns into another couple of rounds and then another couple until eventually I'm not playing anything else)."""
1;Awesomely fun game. Easy to play hard to master. Frustrating at times. Moving at other times. Well worth the money. Can run on a potato because it's so well optimised.Update After playing more than 350 hours the above still stands. There are some maps that don't run on a potato and there are some frequent server issues. Don't let that stop you playing the game though!
1;pros very fun game with friends love the competition great variety of cars and skinscons pretty stupid ranking system (i dont know how Psyonix determines your wins/losses) some unfair match ups (e.g. experts matched up against legends) a few ball glitches and weird physics that could defintely be fixedOverall its a very fun game and has a lot of gamemodes. I would say its worth buying but the competitive side to this game can be frustrating.
1;Overall a great gameBUTthe community is ing toxic and cancer and the devs want to fix this by banning you from chat if you curse too much.which is ing stupid.They could have easily just blocked curse words so you couldnt even send it in the chat because if you get banned because you get angry on some idiot then you will get banned from text chat so you cant even answer to a normal person who wants to talk or trade or anything...Gr8 job psyonix.
1;Really a great game takes time to get good at but fun with friends! Definitely recommend! 10/10EDIT After awhile of playing this game because I reviewed it at about 28 hours I can definitely say that I am much better than what I was. So glad I bought this game and is still one of my daily games I play. Love the new update with crates cars and the new rumble gamemode. Honestly nothing bad I can say about this game.
1;I can't fly with my cars but I'm having loads of fun with my friends. Plus I can wear a wizard's hat and leave a trail of sparckles behind.Although repetitive not to mention that I don't like soccer this is a fun and enjoyable kick back and relax swear when you miss the goal game.
1;This game is worth your money everything about it is just so amazing. It's not easy to learn how to play but flailing your car about in a desperate attempt to score whilst screaming with your friends is just so exhilirating. Sick aerial goals feel better than cross map tomahawks anyway. Not recommended for anyone who wants to have a life outside of their houses. BEWARE Lag and performance issues are common! Make sure your that both your system and internet are good!
1;Absolutely addicting Game! Has a very high skill ceiling so be aware that you will have to invest a lot of time if you want to get really good. After 500+ hrs in I'm the 3rd highest Rank (Champ) and i would say I've just about mastered 50% of the things you can do in this game. Would recomment to anyone who likes fast paced competetive games.
1;Rocket League is the best team based online game I've played in years. There's a lot of gameplay here in such a simple package. The community can be a little toxic to be honest but that is true for many online games.The developer is tweaking ranked play and I think it will be solid in the next season.
1;This is one of the best games I have played in a very long time. It can be very challenging in some matches and completely hilarious is others. The developers continue to add new and exciting content with many cosmetics that allow you to customize your car. I don't spend money on costmetic items for video games usually...rocket league is one game that I make an exception for. Buy this game!
1;I love this game.I first tried it on PS4 with friends and I actually didn't like it at all.I gave it a try on PC during last sales and it's another experience. I highly recommend buying it well worth the 20$. It's my second most played games at the moment.And yeah try using a controller.
1;Went to a game of pickup soccer with friends and scored using my car. Killed the goalie but got a free hat. 5/7 would do again.The use of crates to supply DLC is a decision I fully support as it gives people a chance to trade for items instead of just purchasing them while those who have the money to do so can open the crates and support Psyonix.
1;good game overall but boring without friendspros +so much cars and items &amp and u trade with other players+skills and teamwork is the main thing you need (not pay to win)+you can create private server for you and your friends+singleplayer and season mode but very easy for most players+another sports modes+so much maps to play in+tournamentscons ranked system is terrible kids everywhere servers
1;I'd give a thumbs up and definitely recommend it.It's a lot of fun but players are a bit out of control latey. Cussing you out and then reporting you for their obscenities.Don't tell people not to ride your cootchie they will ban you for that but not bad the other players calling you a .Cootchie is much more harsh!!!
1;A game which made me yell and laugh out loud waking my neighbors and made me want to throw my laptop through the window. Getting used to playing with the 360 controller takes some time but once you get used to it (and sending wrong quick replies/commands with the d pad) you won't go back to the keyboard
1;I have aprox. 165 hrs on this game and I can say that its very fun but if you ever want to become actually good at the game you have to practice absolutely everything. It's like a full time sport where you have to put a crazy amount of time and effort in to break through the lower ranks. it is highly rewarding to be a good player though like any other sport.
1;"""This game has consumed a large portion of my waking life so naturally I will explain why. I have no idea why I first played this game seeing as I do not enjoy """"sports"""" games if that label even applies here. However I was instantly hooked and amazed at this games ability to be both simple and rich in depth of skill. Although they've become a bit gluttonous with their micro transactions this game still has incredible value."""
1;Probably THE most addictive game i've played on a PC... perfect game design and simple yet genious gameplay mechanics using physics as a main toolEDIT After almost 1000 hours I'm still hooked to a game that I never thought I would play more than a few games )... a must buy!
1;If you like soccer and jumping cars well you got just the thing. Rocket league is a very fun game and you could go competetive if you'd like a fairer match. But if your ping is bad I don't recommend because you'll end up not playing and teleporting like a mad man. Otherwise it's a very good game.
1;Rocket League is my first love. The first game I owned to get over a hundred two hundred three hundred hours. It has been a complete joy to play. I recommend this to anybody who likes to play with friends. It has everything thing that you would want in a game. A casual and more stressful mode for people looking for more serious competition. Its perfect.
1;This game........THIS GAME!! It is a very simple concept yet difficult to master. While there is 1v1 this game is best experienced if played with a team preferably with your friends. At first i didnt expect this game to be groundbreaking but now i think its safe to say i love this game more than other big titles such as CS. This game was perfect from launch day and the updates can only make the game better. 50000000/10
1;This game taught me the concepts of sin cos and tan. It taught me how to calculate geometry on the fly. I am a better person at math because of this game.This game also taught me that i can break a controller really easily by slamming it against my desk.10/10
1;This is the game that I've been spending most of my time on it and it never gets me bored. The core gameplay is just so consistent and interesting that I could play alone or with my friends at any time. The variation of customization also drives me crazy with excitement. I love this game! I LOVE IT !
1;Rocket League is a game that is best understood after a game played. For me I could not imagine liking this game. A friend got a four pack about a year ago and after one game I was hooked. This game is my favorite. The game is so simple that anyone can understand how to play but so difficult that nobody can master it. Truly a masterpiece.
1;300+ hours and still trying to learn new skills within the game. This game is very easy to pick up but rather hard to perfect. I can't recommend this game enough especially when it is only $20!Edit Now have over 800 hours and am still learning new skills
1;Great game....... If you play with a group that understands DONT hit the ball towards your own goal. Once you get the hang of flying and flips with accuracy you will rule the field. Just remember teamwork and every so often stuff will happen that will make your jaw drop.
1;Massively fun immersive &amp thrilling esport on the brilliant Unreal 4 engine runs really smoothly even on an older system while still looking beautiful. There is a competitive league and various more casual game modes. Only missing a racing mode. Matches last about 5 mins each so it's always easy to pick up and put down... and then pick up again!Can't believe how addictive this is maybe thanks to the continued support from the developers?
1;"""Clocking in at 1000+ hours and there is still more to learn. A stupidly high skill ceiling will ensure that the next 1000 hours are spent climbing the ranks.The developers are actually trying to give the players a better experience with every update.As for the award you know how the saying goes """"Can't end the night on a loss."""""""
1;Football + Cars + Rocket Booster Rocket LeagueFly around make epic goals epic safes and have tons of fun!! Very performance friendly Cross plattform (PC/PS4) Easy to learn Hard to master Nice graphics Customizations Rockets on Cars Funny Game Modes More Customization
1;This game of car football started off small with just normal football then it made Ice hockey then it made basketball sure these wernt popular but i gave good content to the community that psyonix but sure 2 years after the game was launched the server are still but with the competitive system and the gamemodes for the casual players is enough to entertain anybody!
1;Best sports Game in years!Constant free contant updates as new game modes new arenas and new items! And they do listen to the comuntiy and do change a lot of things the comuntiy recomands for example Saveable presets of Car s being able to set different items to each color of the car.I played it almost everyday since i got it. And since they added the Rumble mode its like a totaly new game. Great mode! Ok sometimes new added Achivements are bugged but they fix it after some time )
1;"""It's really rather simple. Live your life or play Rocket League. There is no """"do both"""" option once you start. Get a hold of some friends (or play with other random addicts online) and forget time place job girlfriend/boyfriend kids to eat etc and so on and just play this game."""
1;The best $20 I have ever spent on steam. Hands down.An absolute RIOT to play with friends.EDIT Still the most fun game I've played with friends.EDIT STILL the best 20 dollars I have ever spent.EDIT STILL the best 20 dollars I have ever spent but the Rocket Pass is kinda aids.
1;Easily my most played game of all time. Maybe Final Fantasy 7 can give it a run for its money but by and large this is the most addicitve game I've ever played. I love it. I want to bone the cars sometimes because it's so good. That said invest in an indestructible controller because sometimes you will get so you will on your controller before throwing it off a mountain. Really.
1;Cool Unique and fun gameThe perfect game to play with friendsAfter 1200h it is still one of the most enjoyable games ever.You can always improve and learn new playing styles.After 1600h they made Rocket League great again. By releasing sports to the ranked playlists. Amazing.Side note Some bugs have been in the game for a long time.
1;Another glorious rage quit simulator. If you have enough tolerance for children who are on the same level and constantly insult you then it is a good game.With enough friends to play... it is pure joy. After exactly two years since I wrote this review you can have I feel of accomplishment by reporting harassment of any kind AND some days pass you log in you get a message that something was done against someone you reported. Yay?!
1;Rocket league is one of the best games i've played in years and the best to play with friends.The thing i like most is that you dont have to always be competitive so you can just go around and learn how to freestyle and have fun. while other people who like the competitive side of the game more can play competitive with other people who like that aswell. Thats why i nominated Rocket League for the best game of the year
1;Just BUY IT! This is the most awesome game I've ever played or seen. You can jump in for 1 or 2 matches or play 5 hours straight. Play in casual mode or test your skill in ranked. Rage with team of randoms or gather your friends and kick some It is still lot of fun.If you really don't know wait for sale but I assure you it's well worth the money. Hell I'd sacrifice my leg and some non vital organs if I had to.
1;A friend recommended this game and i was like meh.... But this is the most fun i have had with a game.... (going back to NES times in my brain....) .... ever!!!! Really... buy it... Even if you do not like soccer or driving games... And if you should be a fan of the former Top Gear Team.... BUY NOW JEREMY COMMANDS!!! .... and me too. You will not regret it... especially with some good buddies!
1;The game is basically football with cars instead of people but have to say haven't played a more fun sports game than this one. The game is very interesting and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for a game to have fun with although there is a competitive part to the game as well.
1;"""10. For (i monday i++) 20. morning of ith day 8AM 30. """"I'll play 3 games of rocket league and get to finish some really important work. """"40.50. 10 hours of rocket league later 60.70. """"I'll get up really early tomorrow to compensate for today.""""80. Continue Loop.10/10 would destroy their careers again"""
1;Very fun game but only recommend if you have a few friends to play with knida boring if you dont but if you do this game is great. I didnt think it was going to be worth the money so i got it on sale Id buy it again and again now... one of them games were if you win your happy and mad if you lose. Constant updates making the game better and better easy to run and the graphics are ing dog... just buy it and refund if you dont like it... but you will... probaly...
1;love this game its a perfect mix of sports and racing. Its a great clean game that I think is also great for playing with friends and is enjoyable for a wide variety of people. Highly recomend it. (Note If you are planning to use this game on split screen you need two controllers will not work with keyboard and controller)
1;Simple fun turned into competive fysics its fast paced action in which control strategy but mostly skill are ever important +Great dev+Cheap n Fast DLC. +Hard to master+Fun n Fast paced Controller is by far the best control systemA 32 hour marathon made me realise I crave my cherry browns.
1;Stop reading reviews and just get the game. for every minute you waste reading reviews you are missing out on the combustable flying customizable rocket car kicking overly large soccer balls (which don't even look anything like soccer balls) action... and we all know you don't want to miss any of it.
1;"""When I bought this game I would have never thought I would now almost have 300 hours in this and still be playing it ten months after I bought it. But the game is just easy to pick up and super fun to play together with friends. The """"easy to learn hard to master"""" type of game."""
1;A really addicting great game. I've been play This game is definetly a fun one to play with but could still use a bit of improvement. There is quite a bit of lag and the match ups can be really bad when new players get paired up against/with level 20+ players. If some of these things are fixed as well as a few other bugs this game has huge potential. Plus who doesn't like hunting and killing their friends?ying it for ages and it's fun and exciting and very competitive. 100% perfect.My only negative point about this game is that now i'm on anti depressants it is very difficult to play effectively. It's kinda crushed me that i can't play competively anymore.
1;Super fun with friends. You don t even need to be good at the game to enjoy it. I think that this game is good to play when you have 2/3 friends and all of you are bored just join rocket and you will be more happy! enemy goals are not included in this happiness but... when your team scores its a really cool moment D Also games are super fast so if you are just spending a little time this game is great )
1;Having to write a review for the first time for steam so it may aswell be this Bought it on sale a while back for about $15 a little under 400 hours later and i still can't get enough of it! Have bought all their DLC and i don't plan on stopping any time soon. Great community of gamers and supporting developers who are constantly updating and improve this game9.5/10 .5 deduction for making wasteland a thing
1;Really an amazing game.. One of the best soccer realated games on Steam. Fun to play with friends and also to play online with randoms. Has many gamemodes that you will enjoy and that's what made this game unique. Any computer can basically run this game.. you don't need a complicated setup. Amazing game 9/10
1;Alright so... the game itself is awesome and I can easily say it's my favourite game on steam. There are a lot of maps cars and customizations but there's one thing that I hate about this game... the community. Sadly it's full of s ready to insult you for every little mistake you make. If they lose it's your fault if they win it's their merit.So yeah you should definitely buy this game you're gonna have a ton of fun but bring some friends with you!
1;If you love cars and soccer this is truly your dream game!This game is both competitive and fun and is definitely worth more than a cheap $20Definitely one of my favourite games so far!Definitely recommended to get it especially if you are a fan of soccer/racing.
1;I love this game!!! I have a few suggestions You should add a Super Rare item/car. It should be abled to be sold on the market and it should have like a 1/10000 chance of getting it after an ONLINE game. It should be a red colour.You should reduce the amount of XP gained in exhibition mode to stop people farming.
1;First game Didn't know what I was doing Didnt touch the ball Couldn't figure out how to jump/boost Kept hitting space to jump and changing the cameraSecond game Looked at settings to figure out how to controll Somehow scored a hat trix Got boosted from level 1 to level 4 forgot to save replayNext Played tutorials Failed at tutorials Still suck at game Still wonder how I scored that hat trixYou can ride on walls use your rocket booster to fly and the music is pretty good.10/10 Awsome game!
1;Easy to learn hard to master. Fun game to play solo even more fun with friends! Graphics music gameplay interface etc. everything is smooth and clean. This is the kind of game where you still have fun losing while watching a replay of the other team scoring an epic goal.
1;Rocket Cars capable of flight driving on the ceiling/walls double jump dodging. In door arena soccer combined?It's quite fun easy to pick up quite difficult to master very addicting. A lot more addicting and fun than you'd expect just watching streams of it. Tons of unlocks and it sounds like the devs will be behind this one for a while. Totally recommended at face value or especially whenever it gets discounted.If you're tired of the endless stream of MOBAs FPS' and RPGs give it a shot.
1;Rocket League. This game can be a fun and rediculous game with the cars paintjobs flags hats ect. But once you realize that it can be something more than a silly game it can be super intense man. Like the silly parts of it hides the esports part of it and its crazy. The game get more tough the more you play through it. Me and my close friend realized it early on once it got us hooked on it. Lets just say its super stressful.
1;The game is so much better than intially thought. The idea of cars playing football should stay on the TV (Top Gear).....oh how wrong I was! Such a great game when played with friends it is well worth the 15. You will have many many hours on this game guaranteed!10/10 Would try flying around the arena again!
1;An amazing remake of the game Battle Cars. It's a truly unique game. The game is simple you customize your own car then you use it to play in a physics based soccer/football game. The game can be quite challenging at first but once you get the feel of the game it is truly an addicting game. Graphics Quality 9 / 10Gameplay 10 / 10
1;One of the best games I've ever played. When it comes to gameplay also lots of free updates.Crates are little bit weird also events now have microtransactions. Also had to mute all the chats because the community is really really toxic. Still can't stop playing this game just too much fun.
1;Product received for free. Pretty fun game. My buddies had been asking me to play with them for quite some time finally started playing and I loved it. It's got fun competition and I'm always on the edge of my seat feeling like I'm at some sort of sporting event getting loud when the ball gets close to goal then sighing when it doesn't go in. All fun and games love it.
1;8/8 gr8 m8. Really fun game! I love playing it! Great community and hours upon hours of entertainment! If you are thinking about getting this game do it. If you do not like it keep playing it. It gets better as you get better. If you can't get better watch youtube or twitch and it really helps! Thanks for making this great game Psyonix!
1;One thing you need to know about this game is that it's competitive as .Don't listen to the reviews saying that it's relaxing casual or whatever this is real and you will get yelled at.Just a friendly warning but the game is still awesome just suggest playing with your friends that way it's much more fun.
1;"""5 more min? Games only go for 5min.... 3hrs later *played multiple games*.....""""Well that game went for a little longer than expected""""Fails english class because didnt hand in english assignment on timeThus doesnt know how to speak englishMoves to Japanmovetojapan/10"""
1;Just love it. Great game constant content created by them for the player base. While the games community can be toxic sometimes overall the community and it's streamers are amazing banding together supporting their game and generally making it fun to log in and spend your time there.
1;Seriously addictive game once you get the hang of it! It is true that you might have to invest a lot of hours before you can do cool stuffs skill wise(around 200). But once you are out of the beginner's phase you can really add up the hours quicker than you think. Amazing game! never get tired of playing it.
1;Rocket League is a game that is very easy to pick up and even harder to put down. I've never been a fan of soccer or even sports games in general but something about this game just keeps me coming back every time I look at it. I would definately recommend this game to anyone of any age!
1;After being on the fence about playing this for a while I killed some toilet time by watching some livestreams of people playing this. I decided to buy it to give it a shot. 10.3 hours into day 1 I have killed my day off and still want to play more. This is awesome especially with friends.
1;Flying cars playing soccer? Bah leave me alone.Im not a great fan of sports games especially not soccer but this doesnt have a lot to do with soccer.Simply one of the most dynamic and rewarding titles i have ever played.servers 9/10graphics/audio 9/10gameplay 10/10learning curve 8/10 (git gud)skill factor 10/10gamedesign short intense rounds. still qualifying for the long term.Holy cow! Everybody dance!
1;10/10 One of the best if not the best game ive played ever. Gameplay is great and so is everything else.My only issue with it is that the game often crashes when match making and it always crashes when trying to change the wheels for my car. I would love this to be fixed
1;Was playing Rocket League and heard someone knocking at the door. Fought the dogs to get to the door and listened to a teen as she asked me to donate to a charity to help teens. Went back inside for the checkbook and wrote the teen a check. Come back to play rocket league. Kicked from the match and banned for 8 minutes for leaving the match.10/10 would get banned for donating to charity again.
1;Highly Highly reccomended. There's nothing else quite like it. Rocket league is one of those games that is easy to get into but extremely hard to master. You will have just as much throwing yourself at the ball in the first 10 hours as you will hitting aerials into the goal at 100 hours. The games are quick and satisfying and always leave you wanting more. If you pick this up on sale you will not be dissappointed. $13 is a steal.
1;One of the most fun multiplayer gaming experiences i have ever had (and i'm still having). Simple to learn but hard to master yet anyone can have fun. The game keeps getting better with each update thanks to the competent devs. It will keep going for a long time!
1;I finally understand Wall Street. I finally understand the 1%. I finally understand Capitalism. I witnessed a van wearing a sombrero propel itself across a soccer field using nothing but money. I am a true capitalist now. If only there were wheels with dollar signs to truly express my love for the stock market.Oh wait.There are.God bless America.And Mexico I guess.
1;Rocket League is a great and unique game one of a kind. It's great who wouldn't love football with rockets!? Because damn a lot of people do (including me). Dev team is really active and really active on community forums reddit and twitter. They have some great ideas and keep implementing them. The game just keeps getting better and better! Definitely worth the price.
1;Rocket league is one of the best racing games on steam. Its really fun and rewarding when epic stuff happens. The customization system is good and allows every player to make a unique car. The dlc doesn't make the game P2W because its purely cosmetic.I think this game is really cool so i will recommend it to anyone.BUT If you do not own a gamepad controller for pc i wouldn't buy it.
1;I rarely review games but Rocket League has earned a special place in my extensive library. Its like playing soccer but less boring. Fly through the air drift spin in circles score goals a multitude of ways and demolish your enemies I personally enjoy demolishing my enemies. Definitely worth a buy.
1;"""Great game! You may think at first that how does a soccer game which is played with flying cars could be fun well it is! When a friend first told me about this game I said """"Nah not interested"""". Then a bunch of other friends bought it too so then I decided to give it a try and I'm not dissapointed.You can spend hours on a single session playing with your friends and it's really competitive.Recomended 100%."""
1;This game is so much fun. It's soccer... but with cars. It's one of those games where even if you're in that situation where you gotta play alone it's still super fun. Well priced. Graphics are great. Gameplay Mechanics are awesome. Easy to learn. Super fun to play. Even better with friends. Highly recommend this game. 10/10 for sure
1;Honestly I think the unique feature about this game is the game is about Cars and Soccer which is the only game I know that is about Car Soccer I think Psyonix Developer puts effort into making the players happy and make the game fun This might not be entirely true but I think they really give it their best.
1;I'm not one to rate games but rocket league is great. It is one of my most played games for a reason. But to have a ban on people for losing connection to a game on ranked is t. I'm mad as right now. So yall can go yourselfs for adding that t. Besides that though the game is great. Again yourselves for adding dumbass bans.
1;Rocket League where if you dont do well your teammate calls you noob and get's angry i kind of like that....Its entertaining. Its an awesome fun game to spend your time every now and again DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT get addicted other wise you will become a keyboard worrior and start saying ''Noob'' Enjoy the game its fun with friends or family.
1;Great game a MUST if you played the prequel Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. The slightly easier to say Rocket League is a great successor.Only minor problem I have with it is that its capped at around sixty because of the cross play with the PS4 (which struggles at sixty and overheats like a dog in a car)
1;A nice game that teaches team play control over emotions and eliminate errors by trial and error. With cool graphics and interestingly presented vehicles you will not be able to break away from your computer. The game has unfortunately one big minus bad servers these servers are so bad that having a weaker router although having a few Mbits or ms (ping) you will have lags as if your computer came from the Stone Age Split.
1;Gameplay and first impressionshttps //youtu.be/Mm6XXiZ7ha0Loving this game right now simple but tricky to master. Timing and situational awareness are pretty key. Learning all the different moves you can use and how to use them seems a lot tougher than it first appears. Local splitscreen coop online coop ranging from 1v1 to 4v4. Had a blast with it so far. Looking forward when I can spend more time with the online aspect of the game.
1;This game is 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase the game.In all seriousness i believe this game is awesome to play either alone or with friends and you also have to bind the word ''Savage!'' in your quick chat settings for more fun
1;Rocket league works as a competitive solo game and a fun party game to play with your friends. There's a ton of customizatioin in this game like cars tires boosting animations flags etc.... I don't even like football and I think this game is fun as hell and for such a low price point you should definitely try it out.
1;Ok so... when i first saw this game and this was before it was releasead i really liked it and i knew it was going to be my next favourite game .I have a lot of awesome memmories on it and also i met a lot of friendly people.The community is like 40% very friendly 40 % very toxic and 20 % normal people.Also very unique and addicting
1;Lets start. Мy friend made me to play this game (we are not friends anymore) and i didnt really like it. Now 2016 i got the game myself other than pirating it before and LOVE THIS GAME. Of you like soccer THIS is the game for you there is even a cross platform for PS4 and PC.Thanks for reading my review.
1;Great game if you like the competive aspect dont have to like soccer to enjoy the game awesome fun with friends working together but playing with randoms can annoy the hell out of you as there is alot of bad team mates around Cheap fun for you and your tight mates DownSide need DLC for Acheivments biggest hate about the game yes i got the dlc as i like to 100% games i enjoy
1;When U Bring Cars And Soccer You Get An Extreemly Addictive Game! Definetly Recomend To Everyone!!!!Love The Amount Of Customizations You Can Add To Your Car Hopefully In The Future They Bring Out More.!!!The Feeling Of Scoring A Goal Whilst doing A Flip Is Just Awsome!!This Game Is Well Worth $20 Im Sure U Wull Play Over And Over Again Once You Have Tried It!
1;What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! What a save! if you enjoyed this review you will love Rocket League
1;Rocket League is a great game even if you unlock everything there are still goals to reach. Leveling up and best of all beating your friends. I LOVE THIS GAMEIf you get this game...I recommed changing the video settings so that you get the best gameplay.I also recommend that you do the tutorial! It is VERY helpful
1;An excellent skill based competitive physics game where you control a battlecar in a football match. A brilliant idea that is hard to understand without having played the game.Even though I am not a fan of racing games nor soccer games this particular experience is always enjoyable and leaves me wanting more. And you can always get better by playing and practicing.The developers continue to work on the game. The pro scene and creative community are great to follow.
1;The best game to begin playing at 4 00 PM and look at your clock and realize that it's 2 00 AM. You get lost in this game and never want to stop playing. It's the most addicting game I've ever played with a huge skill ceiling.Edit 700 hours in still amazing. In case you wanted to know.
1;So is Rocket league worth the money ? First of all lets compare pros and cons+ High skill cealing+ Really fun with friends+ Individual Skill of a player matters+ Respectful Devs who look in to problems in a game Iffy Servers connection issues can occur. A Lot of Paid Dlc Rocket league is one game that is worth money if you don t want FPS and MOBA to play competetively ? Rocket league is your lord and saviour )
1;Soccer meets driving once again in the long awaited physics based multiplayer focused sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars! Choose a variety of high flying vehicles equipped with huge rocket boosters to score amazing aerial goals and pull off incredible game changing saves!
1;Rocket league is easily in my top 5 games of all time. It has wonderful purly skill based multyplayer. It's fun for all ages (with mute) and for all skill levels. The developers are always adding new features that enhance the experience as well as fixing problems pointed out by the community. You will not find a better value in gaming.
1;Man this game is addictive and fun. I am a challenger 2 right now in solo ranked and was challenger 1 in doubles before I started learning to play on controller. Yep this game can be played on a keyboard and mouse or on an controller I surely know that controller is better but yet felt the power of a controller in the game as it takes real time in game to learn use controller after keyboard. Overall the game is super good and I recommend to everyone!!! GG BOYS
1;"""I joined a ranked 2v2 gameI noticed that the opponents where playstation childrenI proceded to call them s and yell at themwe then continued to beat them where i ended the game with saying """" you""""10/10 would yell at a console peasant againP.S Playstation kids"""
1;Excellent Game.Original idea well executed very fun to hit balls around with flying cars. Note that it can be a little frustrating at first but if you keep playing it will become easier. Would recommend DLC Supersonic Fury. I've seen a lot of hate for the Batman V Superman DLC but why on earth would you want to put a hat on the Batmobile?
1;Easy to learn insanely difficult to master but still fun!Fantastic art style look + feel.Only game where I don't care about losing even after 1000+ hours of playtime.Great devs constantly interacting with the community.Unless you only play games with a story + campaign there are few reasons to not like this game.
1;You would think car soccer is dumb but in reality its the one of the most perfect games out there. Although seeming to be less mechanically intensive as other games once you begin to understand what makes the difference between a good and a great player you see that it really is. As someone who has lost interest in soccer I still find this game very fun and entertaining.
1;If you somehow haven't heard of this game by now get INSIDE from OUTSIDE and start ballin with cars and soccer balls! You ever watch Top Gear? They did this and then BOOM Rocket League is born. Best part is Everything. You not a fan of soccer? Who cares. Not a fan of cars? Not my problem. You a fan of kickin some a$$ and snapchatting sick goals to your friends to make them totes jelly? You bet your a$$ you are. Do the American thing and get this game. *Drops Mic*
1;I bought this game and didn't play it for a few months. Now it's my daily game and I can't recommend it enough.Extremely active and helpful devs who actually use player suggestions new content continuously added fun game for hours on end.It can take a while to get used to the controls and gameplay but anyone can get the hang of it pretty easily and the different gameplay modes are sure to please most players.
1;"""Neo Tokyo Hype!!! ......... """"Ten outta Ten"""" JonTron... but in all seriousness... this is a really great game it's really unique... and it's just an overall fun game to play... I rate this game.... a... """"Ten outta Ten"""" JonTron..... ok i'll stop now XD"""
1;"""When I was first shown rocket league my reaction was """"really? rc cars and soocer woooo"""". However after a couple games it is straight up addictingly amazingly fun and it stays fun just because of the skill involved there is always room for improvement."""
1;Nice Shot!Nice Shot!Nice Shot!What a save!*Banned from chat for 4 seconds*ok but actually you fly around driving into a soccer ball in a hopeless attempt at actually trying to play the game like soccer. Plus now with the latest patch you can spend hours customising your cars and theres even crates for all you people who are terrible with your money! i may of already opened some...
1;Incredibly fun game for all skill ranges.Offers a unique gaming expereince that can be both casual or competitive. Rocket league allows an expansive customisation system and allows players to trade with each other. It is an extremely addictive game that you can play solo or with your friends. For the price this game is incredible a must have title that will not disappoint D
1;Simply fantastic. This game has the community and support that every game wants. The gameplay and aesthetics won't stop making me come back for more. I'm not exactly good at the game with only me and my keyboard but the exhilarating feel you get when scoring an epic goal or save is so addicting. Spectacular game.
1;High intensity game with near to no entry skill level and a very high skill ceiling. Makes for a awesome game to play with friends on lan or over voip. Has crossplay with the playstation community and the community itself is fairly chill. Fantastic soundtrack good visual design and the different maps are great. Convinced
1;With amazing fast paced rocket cars and very fun battles I have yet to have a bad game.All the amazing accrobacies you can do in this game give you a very rewarding feel after performing this game is a must have.If you are on pc get a controller though because it's much better with that.
1;"""What do you mean """"there are other games"""" on Steam? This is heresy!! RL is your friend...RL is good...RL cares about you...you must....assimilation is inevitable...resistance is futile...Most amazing complete luck shot I ever got was being knocked into the goal after hitting off the side wall....flipped upside down in the collision...... ball bounces off my underside up and into the goal for score..15/10 Would accidentally imitate Kronovi by complete luck again!!"""
1;Rocket League is an amazing game you can have so much fun by just hitting a ball. Seriously I was at first not sure about the game but as I played and got better I realized that you can go through a lot training as hard as you can with friends to become the best players making amazing goals and saves. I really believe that many MANY people should install this game. You will love it.
1;honestly this game might seem a little bit childish at first but once you get enough hours in the game (say 100 hours) then a sense of teamwork and accomplishment will rise when you play (especially when you successfully score your first aerial goal). 20 dollars spent on this game is 20 dollars well spent
1;This is a fantastic game. If u like competitive game or u like cars or u like soccer or u like hockey or basketball u will love this go u deck out ur cars and u can even get batman's car too it also fun to play with friends too I can't explain how much I love this game
1;One thing I've found when playing this game you don't have to like football to love it. Best game on Steam by far. One of the most enjoyable and addicting games I've ever played. Good price free updates cheap DLC's and I never get bored. Can't get much better... LOVEEE IT
1;"""I love this game! At first I was very hesitant about the purchase. I thought it would be a """"weekend game"""" play it once and watch it collect dust. Damn was I mistaken. Amazing game highly recommended for anyone. Competative or casual you're bound to like the game."""
1;Awesome game really enjoying it really quick and the game never crashed for me. I think this is one of my favourite games I ever played.Maybe some matchmaking details can be used in next update pls P.But the whole game is just awesome If you like cars football and quick action this game is made for you....
1;Nothing like i've ever played before. Nothing i ever expected to play. And probably will never play anything like for a long time. Unique fast complex and pretty but easy to get into. And the Esports scene is taking of in a big way. Almost 3k hours played still just as if not more fun. Buy it nothing like it out there.
1;Very high skill ceiling for competitive players and also allows for casual fun if you dont play everyday.Game engine's physics are simple but diffcult to master (in terms of vehicle control).All vehicles have same stats which is good for balance and are only different for preference of looks and physical hitboxes.Just overall fun to play even when you aren't good and still learning to play. I recommend for anyone who can use a controller for pc. 10/10
1;"""This is easily one of the most instantly addictive games I've ever played.You ever hear the saying """"a minute to learn a lifetime to master""""? It was made for games like this. There's nothing complicated in the mechanics of it just in the interaction between players. It's just good old fashioned fun with a new paint job.Just one more game... just one more game..."""
1;Great game to past time with friends.Played about 1 500 hours on PS4 and a bit on here and it is never ending fun. From the first goal to your 5 000th goal you will still feel the same never ending satifaction of destroying the other team and spaming (What a Save!).bought this game for all my friends and i do not regret my purchases.
1;This game is one of the best sports multiplayer ever made. It is a remake of SSARPBC and while the first game had a small community of PlayStation players this game has taken everyone by storm. It is a typical example of a game which is easy to play but tough to master. I recommend everyone to give this game a try on whichever platform you like PC PS4 or XBO and give it atleast 5 10 hours of play and the next 100 hours will automatically follow.
1;This game is Amazing! I have been playing for Almost 1 year and a half and Ive gotten so good. There are many ranking sytems and can trade Many items. It is a very diverse and different game and there are none that compete against this game. I would defienelty recommend this you if you havent bought it yet!
1;Well good for the most part! I really like Rocket League. Its a fun game to be playing with your friends Good trading system You can make some good profit from here. Good and friendly community.But some things are really annoying and have to be fixed! Servers are laggy in 3v3 or 4v4 Frequent ping fluctuations Frequent fps dropsThese factors really make it a bad experience playing this game.
1;With over 1000 hours in the game it's about time I give this a rating. Obviously it's an amazing game. The skill it takes to be good is what drives me to continue playing all the time. The devs are constantly coming out with new content and game modes and there's never a dull moment. The only downside really is the servers sometimes as they are known to have some issues. If that could be resolved everyone who plays it would have nothing to complain about as that would make it a solid 10/10.
1;"""*shoots a ball into the opponent net* *enemy shoots it back to our net and score a long shot*friends start spamming """"Great pass!"""" *trying to save a hard ball**fails miserably* friends spam """" What a save!"""" 100% would spam """"what a save!"""" at any touch"""
1;Great game very fun easy controls with room for skilled players to be better (aerials). Don't come to this game expecting fair ranked play though as of now you can quit ranked matches anytime you want with no penalites and leave you teammates outnumbered.I reccomend this game for unranked play.
1;Ich empfehle dieses Spiuel total ABER es waere gut wenn ihrt Jungs noch andere Controller ausser xBox komplitabel machen wuerdet wie zum Beispiel USB Game Pad oder USB Vibration Joystick usw.This game is great But it would be nice if u guys make it able to use other controller than the xBox one.Like USB Game Pad or USB Vibration Joystick etc.
1;Why is Rocket League a great game for you?This is so so much fun and addictive game price is cheap... Let's go DGood +Great gameplay+Good graphics+Good matchmaking system (1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4)+Background music+Desing of cars+This game is easy to pick up and hard to master+Options in game+4 players split screen option+Customization +Very competitive Bad Sometimes a bad server connections.
1;This game is soo adictive and fun to play.. It takes time to master advanced moves days and months but it is worth it...Matchmaking is fast and you usually wait for 20 sec..In general unique game that you should try out.. If you don't try this you will be sorry..
1;"""THE ULTIMATE BANANA REVIEW ! PROS CARS ! SOCCER ! GOALS ! SHINY COLORS ! (oooohhhh) TUuuuuuuuurrBooooo ! MORE GOALS ! WTF ! where is this muth*ki**g Ball ? OH ! SHE'S HERE ! GOAL ! WTF Mate ?

EDIT. 2018 No Pin UP DLC ... very disappointed ..."""
1;I am an addict. I don't even want to leave my computer anymore. I forget to eat I don't shower. My girlfriend left me. I am married to the league. I wake up and itch if I don't play in the first 15 min. I drive around town waiting to see cars double jump and flip into infinity. This game has consumed my life. 10/10 would sell my body for 10min on rocket league.
1;Probably one of the most fun games you can play with friends in my opinion Great graphics and music Community isnt the greatest... lol..Variety of cars and cosmetics to choose from to choose the car aesthetic you wantPersonally i think it's easy to learn the game but hard to master it
1;"""Rocket League is a game that exceeds expectations. My first impression was """"Oh this looks kinda fun."""" Oh boy was I wrong.It is a F****** blast. The mechnics are perfect limitless skill ceiling even if you are terrible it's fun to just chase the ball around or terrorize your friends."""
1;I know it says that i've only played for 2 hours but ive played about 1000 hours on console. I really love this game im still getting used to the controls on pc but it still seems like the same fun i had on console. The only problem ive ran into is the casual play matchmaking but thats normal in every game. In my opinion this game is worth the money.
1;This is hands down my favorite game of all time. While many other games I've played tend to get boring after a while I never stop coming back to Rocket League. The fact that it takes years of practice to become better and improve makes this such an amazing game to play because it makes you want to get better and rank up. Whether you're the kind of person that wants to beat everyone and rank as high as you can or just want to have some fun with friends this game is excellent for anyone. .
1;*Update server region added in South Africa (SAF). Thank you Psyonix for the love!!!*With the First Rocket Pass Season done in 2018 and Competitive Dropshot Hoops Rumble and Snow Day upping the competitive games. RL gives you lots of choices in what you want to do and keeps you entertained for more. Psyonix's have improved the communications with the community and regularly show their planned Road Maps for RL.This is a must buy if you are casual or competitive player.
1;After 500 hours of play time it's time for a review! This game still continues to amaze me in that I'm still learning advanced techniques to improve my game play. Super addictive random crazy game play keeps me coming back for more! The devs are really active and continue to modify and add content to the game. If for some reason you live under a rock or haven't bought or played this game GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW! Highly recommended! The come back is real!
1;well i thouhgt after putting over 2k hours into this game i would finally go and write a review.TLDR if you dont own rocketleague yet then where have you been?It is THE game when it comes to easy to learn hard to master. The skill ceiling is enormous and with continued developer support there is no other game out there that has brought me as much joy as rocket league has.
1;This game is awesome and very unique Psyonix is releasing updates from time to time to fix the problems the community has within the game. Also this game is beginner friendly since you will (mostly) get matched against new players too. Also the training system is really useful for both beginner to pro. Overall a very fun and entertaining game. Really recommend it. A must buy!
1;Rocket League is one of those games that people question you for playing until they themselves have played it because the concept of it sounds straight out of a child's imagination.So to explain that point Rocket League is a child's dream with an added twist of competitive nature to attract any age group but also keep people playing with its harder mechanics that make you want to learn.
1;My view on this game? Buy it ONLY if you want to play it with your friends or on single player. The players on the server are (mostly) rude childish and sour losers often abandoning matches and storming out with other players on the team.As far as the game goes it's a lot of fun! The graphics are cool the gameplay is easy to catch and has a good set of skills to master.I strongly recommend it!! Again as far as you don't play with strangers.
1;I thought this game would be massively difficult but I was grateful to find out that thought it does have a learning curve its not that bad to be able to learn how to use the controls and start scoring goals! Highly recommend even if you are on the fence!!!!
1;Cons Toxic community addictive impossible to resist the urge to open crates you'll never make it to diamond Pay to win Way to many cars and there all ugly except octane Lots of scammers can't play the game well without a controller and its just generaly stupid. Pros some times you get a good item out of a crateWould recommend this is my kind of game.
1;When I frist saw this gameI tough to myself I don't see the appeal this looks silly! Then there was a free weekend a damn was is good! This is really a game where you can play casually or start the grind. This game is great with friends aswell whether it's online or split screen!
1;Simple fun and rewarding. Colaborative + competitive + sport + car game.Solid physics and mechanics to feel in control of your car and the ball being able to solo carry games if skilled enough. The multiple modes allows to never get bored and have fun in a lot of ways.8.5/10
1;1. play controller2. git gud3. ????4. profitNo for real D Its very good game for competetive players. It has very good esport potential because you cannot cheat in the game. Also when you ace in cs go your teammates are like yeeeeah nice one onetaps etc. in rocket league when you outplay 3 enemy players in the air while dribbling? WHAT? HOW DID YOU DO THAT? UR OP AS .
1;Easy to learn hard to master.A great game to play just to have fun with some friends or to watch while others are playing it.An e sports scene that will continue to grow.A game for every age and every mindset.And the best developer you could think of!
1;Simply put it's a ton of fun. One of the most polished products out there. but where Rocket League really shines is its UX. So many more games should allow you to sit in matchmaking queue while you get in a few practice rounds then pluck and drop you right into your game when ready. Marvelous.9/10
1;Great game but over the past year or so the developers add stuff that isn't desired (crates xp leveling) and should know better than to merge casual and competitive. Recent changes now prevent two of the best modes (rumble and soccer) from being queued concurrently which was previously available. For many players the changes made over the past year have only had a negative impact on their gaming experience. Disappointing.
1;When playing this game you will either give up in the first hundred hours or you will become hopelessly addicted and be forced to watch yourself become a more and more toxic human being as you try and climb out of Gold 3. 10/10 would recommend to those whjo hate themselves.
1;A very fast paced car ball (ok I know I made the word up myself).It is a good game if solo and a great game if playing with fiends. Played with both keyboard and controller controls are great responsive and easy to adapt. Ques are short you can find a match in 30 sec and play games are not long too.(edit made a real review after playing a bit longer)
1;Rocket League is a Unique Game Based on scoring a ball using cars!Pros Decent Graphics for a Game like this typea Perfect Game If you have Friends to play with.anew Perfect idea that you cant try anywhere else!Trading System is Just Amazing!Constant Updates to keep the game up to date and new items cars fixes and new gamemodes!Cons There is a very large Scamming community!Overall a Game With that price and this unique game Would Recommend!
1;Easy to learn hard to master.Rocket League guarantees hours of fun with or without playing with friends. The community is rather active despite the fact that the player count has decreased during these two years since release. The game itself runs very smooth and is rather lightweight while still giving pleasure for your eyes. It still sort of lacks content so I for one hope that the developers continue to add great content to the game.
1;I think I've played enough of this game to write a review.This is a really great game and is worth buying. I recommend playing on a controller.It's really fun and it can be casual but even from gold and higher it gets really competitive and hard. There are a lot of mechanics that you can learn and there's always something new to do. The key and crate system is ok and you can get free keys (you can't trade with the items tou get from crates opened with then decryptors) for playing the game.
1;all in all worth the money+nice visuals+ranked mode+dlc s cheap and mostly cosmetic +new maps and game modes are free+cross platform+spectator mode+save replays made easy+did not encounter any hacker yet drive /physic model hard to pick up hard to master UE3 (2006!!!) DX9 (2004!!!) matchmaking fails way to often to creat an even match temporal serversided lags (rare but present) too few decals too many Hats/FlagsReview based on MAO
1;"""Just. One. More. Match. ...aaaand its 3 AM!Extremely addictive game easy to learn hard to master. Actual skill and tactics are required. With short 5 minute matches you keep playing """"just one more match""""!Tip disable voice and text chat completely and only use quickchats for tactical communication. The game has quite a toxic community that you really don't want to hear. It's in the options menu tab """"audio""""."""
1;Not bad I purchased the game and jumped in a car. After spending hours driving around an arena rolling my car and chasing a giant ball I finally made it home and was able to play Rocket League.I quickly knew all too well these skills came natural to me and I was scoring all of my teams goals this game was quite easy...Then I played online...Turns out there's worse drivers than me.21.4/10 would watch my team spend half the game on their roof again.
1;This game is amazing! It is basically football with cars... I would recommend this game for those who like football and cars. That's all! AAnd btw I dont like writing rewiews but I love rocket league so I wanted to post a rewiew!Rocket League Rocks!!!
1;This game is the definition of perfection. Every aspect of this game is easy to understand and it is non stop fun. Best of all the creators are giving us what we want! Amazing DLCs and updates keep coming out keeping things awesome! This is a game where the only way to be good is to practice. I love games like this. 10/10 GET THIS GAME IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!
1;Best game I know so far. Not only the game itself is awesume as f*ck but the developers (Psyonix) are the best. Psyonix listens to the players and implement many ideas gained from the community. This is rare in the gaming community these days many developers make games for $$ only. Many ++ for Psyonix and the beautifull game they created!
1;"""hey kiddo (because an adult cannot be an idiot at this point) why do your system of report suck do you know what mean """"EZ"""" (it mean easy and that's not a good sports attitude) or some other terms like """"stfu"""" """"gas your race of jew"""" your romanian brain"""
1;It's an exciting game if you love football and cars. The mechanics and gameplay is fun whereas the game modes add extra hours of gameplay to be the best. It's a simple game and you can play it if you have short spare time and play in short breaks. Recommended!
1;Amazing value for money. It's quick to learn this game and just so fun. All cosmetic items are free no micro transactions it's great. I really look forward to see where this game will go possibly different gamemodes basketball hockey etc would be great. Buy this game it is worth your time.
1;Like sports games? Like FIFA but always felt it lacked control? Like cars and maybe racing games? This is the game. The second I played Rocket League I knew I was in for a good time. Combines the competitive nature of FPS other eSports games with the fun and creativity of sports in a physics based game not driven by sequences of animations.
1;Rocket League is a good game especially when you do not have much money to play other games. You do not have to worry about lag as there are lots of reigions you can play from unlike other games (minecraft). D I hope this helps some people who are about to purchase or wanting to purchase ROCKET LEAGUE!
1;Good game.Intresting and creators frequently update the game while also adding dlc and fun game modes different from the normal ones if you get tired of playing the main gamemodes.Rocket league has a amzing community of mainly nice people by every so often you might find that one salty guy like every other game.
1;Very good game great developers and every few weeks there are additions to the classical game. Psyonix is also caring about their players and it is in general a very nice working almost bugfree longtime league game where you play wo improve and where it is very fun to do so.
1;I don't really like sports and I by extension don't care for sports games. I ing love this game. It's great fun and it's the kind of weird party/competitive mixture of a game that I've seen only Smash Bros pull off so well. It's fantastic the developers are rad af and this game could be a huge eSport. Pick this game up.
1;Alright I have never written a review or I have never thought about writing a review.. but damn! this game is fun as hell! Its intense when coming down to those last few seconds to get a game winning goal! I highly reccomend this game.. for hours of fun for a low price.. GET IT! stop reading reviews and just get it already!
1;Too late in life to enjoy dinosaurs.Too early in life to enjoy teleporters.Just right to play football in cars on a screen where the depression of never finding someone to love is eating me in slowing turning more anitsocial with every goal. My bank account declining in money as I spend 100's of pounds into cars decals and pointless flags. My soul is made for rocket league but my it out for harambe.
1;The game is awesome just wanted to ask the developers one thing.When one scores can you please change the focus of the camera from the empty goal to the scoring player?You know in soccer when a player scores all the team mates go to the scoring player and cheer togheter it would be nice to do so instead of having the camera looking the empty goal.&lt &lt &lt &lt &lt &lt &lt &lt THUMBS UP SO THAT DEVELOPERS NOTICE THAT MESSAGE.&gt &gt &gt &gt &gt &gt &gt &gt TY
1;A must have in your library this game is awesome.Very fun to play and it's even better with a couple friends. Like many said this game is easy to pick up but hard to master.So it's really rewarding to play this game the progression curve in terms of skill is quite high.
1;To be honest playing football with a car was a child dream.Here we go thanks to the developers my dream became true. Moreover developers keep on updating the game which shows their passion to this game and gives us a good point of view about them.I would definetely recommend this game.
1;If you want to play this game for fun stop right know player are ing noob you have to play with friend to play as well as your level the community is not so bad but as always some player are pretty agressive. But if you play with some friends this game is awesome.
1;Well...come on just look how much positive reviews this game has or just look how much guides or youtube videos and more this game has. People love it because come on playing soccer with an oversized ball and rocket powered cars doesnt sound fun ? Really cool game with nice graphics and lots of ways to make your car look awesome. Just go buy it.
1;"""The first time I started playing I played for nine hours straight. In those nine hours I lost my wife to her lesbian lover and the kids in a nasty divorce. She took the kids the house the car and about seventy five percent of what was in the bank. . All I could say was """"Another game.."""""""
1;Fun game eggs cheer you on while you play soccer with your car maybe its not even your car though because theres no scale. Are they remote control? If they are RC are the eggs just large? If someones driving it are the eggs giants? im not sure. Oh and theres rockets. Whats not too love.
1;Apon playing this very addicting game a PC player can find him self loathing every single console player ever. How can you be this bad at the game when the controls are no different for PC if one uses a controller. Please delete PS4 players from this game. Thank you
1;Endless hours of great great fun!Bought the steam controller just to play this game.Takes some effort getting used to the game tho so don't give up right away.Would definetly recommend playin this with a controller. I played the first 150 hours with mouse and keyboard but it's way harder controlling the car in flight compared to when using a controller.RECOMMENDED!
1;i love rocket league just because you can play with friends and have fun i also like the fact that there is competitive so you can really test your skills in rocket league and see who is the better opponent there is nothing bad about this game in my opinion but off corse someone will disagree but thats there view on the game and this is my view on the game thankyou to the developers of ROCKET LEAGUE
1;"""I love this game. Each match is different from the last. I have shouted in distress and i have yelled in victory. the game is so simple yet it still keeps you wanting to play that """"one more match"""" before you decide to call it a day. I really do recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good online competitive game."""
1;Although I've played for 10 hours on this game (at the time of this review) I can say I will spend a lot more time playing Rocket League. This game is very fun and rewards players for performing well. There is an array of items to customize your car to your liking. It is very hard to call this game repetitive.10/10 in my books.
1;It is a one of a kind game where you can easily get into with friends. It is my passion which can be extremely hard to do because I like trying new games. Ever since I bought the game about a year ago I have played it whenever I can. I recommend this game for anyone who likes fast paced non FPS games.
1;The second i started i found it impossible to accurately hit the ball and thought id never get good... Although i was still have a ton of fun and over time got better and became super hooked to the game after some friends and i played it for a while. It has now become my favorite game. Even though its 20$ its worth every penny. Trust me. I recommend 100%
1;"""Ahhh... this game. Well I must say this game grabbed my attention since day 1 and I haven't lost it yet either. This game is specially fun with friends. What if you don't have friends ? (sigh) You can proudly play 1vs1 and start getting salty af so when you actually get friends you start flaming at them cause you're""""so much better""""."""
1;Fun game especially with friends. With randoms though? Watch the madness unfold. You can carry a game 5 0 and watch your advantage crumble because your team mates will try to goal steal they'll up the shot and when it's time to def they can't do all. In the end you lose 5 6 and have a german kid in your team with 0 goals and 0 saves rage at you saying you ed up the game.10/10 would recommend.
1;This game is okay. Pretty good cars tho. Something like a 7... or 8 outta 10? Yeah that's good. So yeah it looks alright too got nice graphics and flames and stuff. Physics are pretty accurate too. Player base need some work tho might be patch in future.all in all its okay.
1;This game is absolutely amazing. I have just over 200 hours on it and am lvl 41. I would highly recommend buying this game if you are wondering about getting it because for me it has kept me entertained for quite a while. Just make sure you dont enrage the 6 year olds
1;Rocket League has alright graphics and is very competitive I personally adore this game as it's alot of fun if you have friends to play with It offers a varity of customizations for your car It's very strategic and is bases on teamwork. There are some glitches in the game though not very many so nothing to worry about overall this game is a win win Get it!
1;It's soccer with cars do I need to say more?I rate this about a 4/5 becauseEverything in this game is wonderful from the gameplay to the customization of the cars. But I wish the custiomization was alittle more indepth. The cars I tend to only use use one of them. Also I bought the car pack becuase I thought the decals would go to every other car not just one specific car so I was alittle dissappointed on that end. But other than the car customization end everything is great.
1;Good game but... only for 20min after that you get angryI will not talk about casual...there are some big improvements that could be made on the competitive for example why 1 defeat is enough to lose a division?but several victories (up to 3) to get oneThe good players stays stuck in plat with (2/3 time) teammates who get carryed from bronze to plat.I remeber I get a rookie (no smurf) in my team he couldn't even toch the ball... 0 points at the end+of course we lose
1;So in being a Steam user since its inception which the entire valve community off at the time I have never done a review on a game. Selfish I know but that's okay.Rocket cars and soccer? Hahaha. Haha. Ha. No. Not a chance. As it would happen...Yes.Yes. Yes.Abso F'ing lutely YES.Incredible.
1;It is a good game but for one who likes and plays soccer in real life it will be a bs game. Many players just run aimlessly to just hit the ball without thinking where it will land. Best played with friends and not solo because the matchmaking is terrible so if you loose better to loose with your friends and not some strangers.
1;"""I was hesitent to buy this at first. I thought okay it's just """"another"""" car soccer game that will get old quickly...I was so wrong. Nine months later (and 400+ hours of play time) I still can't get enough of this game!This is simply the best purchase you can make on Steam!Click that Buy button now!!!"""
1;Probably one of my favourite games. I play consistently with a friend ( 180 hours) and I still suck so it's a testament to how much you need to practice and I love it. No match is boring and props to devs for continually coming up with new ideas like the Rocket Labs Snow Day and Hoops (the latter is a great game of fun). Probably the one game I wouldn't hesitate to buy DLCs. Definitely get this and don't stop playing.
1;pros beautiful design fun while playing by yourself fun with friends soccer but not painfully long and cars instead of people (like they literally just took the bad parts of soccer out) great on keyboard and controller car customization portal cakecons ranking system brown is not a color option
1;What a game!! its fun freindly the best sports game out there hand down it really it utterly amazing and the price you cant argue its very good value.lets start with the good graphicsgamplayfrequent updatesgreat funloads of contentfantastic devsetc etc....id be here all day saying all the stuff.the bad mic support is awfull others a really quiet no matter what you do if using a headset its not just me others have this issueit really is fantastic. fully recomend
1;"""This game ruined my life but my life didn't involve smashing rocket fueled cars into a giant soccer ball over and over again so this game is way better than my life ever was. I rate it """"GAAAH HOW DID I MISS THAT SHOT WHY IS THE OTHER TEAM SO LUCKY"""" / 10 points."""
1;Rocket League is a great game. The pros greatly outweigh the cons. With amazing quick responsive gameplay fast paced matches and lovely graphics. The only downside is that it relies heavily on on line multiplayer which can swing from playing with great teammates to dealing with trolls.
1;experience yelling and blood pumping like never before lose a shot and get yelled at. take the shot and get glory. you yell at your friends or they yell at you heck after a while it does'nt matter cause you don't know what's going on anyway.that's how I best describe this pretty damn awesome spectacular and thrilling game.If you did'nt buy it yet don't even hesitate.10000000/10 best game EVER!!!!
1;"""Buy this game if you like SpeedCarsSoccerBalls (And smashing into them)ExplosionsMore SpeedAccessoriesHats!Holy crap the speedDrinking the tears of your opponentsThe PC Master RaceConstant screaming and """"OHHHHHH""""'sAn enjoyable experience!11/10 IGN. Would definetely play again."""
1;Soccer meets cars in the fast paced world of Rocket League. With ample room for customization both single and multiplayer expirences a party system and even a competitive mode Rocket League seems to bring it all to the table. They even have basketball and hockey modes!
1;This game is incredibly fun it's easy to pick up and difficult the master. Just the way I like it.BUTAND IT IS A BIG BUTT (Again just the way I like it)The game lags way too much and in a game that requires precision that can be incredibly infuriating.But the game is very fun and incredibly good value for money so if you're playing with friends or playing alone like a pathetic loser (Me) you'll love this game.
1;Rocket League is one of the best games i've ever played it is not that hard to learn yet it needs practice... A LOT!!YES IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!1 Flaw tho... The ranking system of this game is a bit devious and especially the duration of the match that u will find.. But despite this flaw all good... PHYSICS ARE 100% ACCURATEGoodluck!!!
1;Personally I love this game. The community isn't toxic (so far) and there is a nice competitive spirit. The matchmaking currently isn't exactly great but the devs are getting right on that and they are pretty decent when it comes to patching bugs glitches or exploits. Of course I would reccommend this game to friends and have already started doing so.
1;900+ hours and counting. A competitive purely skillbased game with a seemingly endless skillceiling. An experience focussed on fun even if you're not into soccer/football at all. There's no need for tons of words just watch a video from a decent player and you can see what this game has to offer.
1;"""Fun game playing on your own but if you gather your friends in a team to play you will order some pizza and play an entire weekend without breaks. Jetfueld cars in a quick match of football hockey or basketball. """"Its all about love and then there was hate"""""""
1;Absolutley an amazing game. I have loved every second of this game. It is most enjoyable to me with 1 or 2 friends but the game still supplies a rather fun experience playing solo. Even if you do not enjoy the sport of soccer or Futbol this game will still intrigue and excite any player that joins the community. Excellent game with excellent game modes. Personal rating 9.5 out of 10 (5 Stars)
1;Im at 91.3 hours thats close to 1 hundred so i think i know most about the game and its safe to say if you buy this game you will not regret 1 dollor you spent on this game 10/10 graphics 9.5/10 gamplay (if including the bugs 9.5 but if no bugs 10 )online 9.8/10 ( people will get mad if you are bad)offline 10/10 ( no one will get mad so thats good ) )but over all its a great game i give it 10/10 but thats my opinon
1;Very good Game to play casually or competitively.You will spend hours trying to do aerial shots and amazing flips.The only thing that is bothering me is the fact that it is pay to play compared to other platforms and theres no exclusive item for Pc players.Really cool DLCs like Basketball or Hockey.
1;Played this until max rank on PS4. This game holds its value and then some. It's a fun and competitive game that is great with friends and strangers alike. I just bought it on PC and with my new gaming rig I was blown away in the first few minutes how much better quality it is than on the PS4. http //www trexgaming.com if you liked my review subscribe to my YouTube channel for a chance to win free Steam games and Funko Pops!
1;Rocket League is a game that personally I find one of the most fun games I have ever played. It is exciting and you never know what will happen next after almost 150 hours of playing this game I still see myself not putting it down any time soon. It is most definatly worth the money and I would highly reccomend it to anyone who is interested in buying it.
1;Amazing. I have not been addicted to a game like this since BF2 came out. Easy to play hard to master. As your skills improve gameplay elements such as aerial tricks and soccer strategy comes into play. The game is super polished and the visuals really draw you in. The only minor complaint is that I wish I did not have to wait at the end of a round for other players to be ready for a rematch. Oh well.Seriously buy this game.
1;BALL BALL BALL BALL GOTTA GET BALL SCORE ARIEL NICE SHOT WOW WHAT A SAVE. Rocket League is the pinnacle of arcade racing/soccer/backetball/team building games out there. Pick it up on sale and get a few friends or just one friend and go against the world.10/is there a need to rate this?
1;Game where is so much fun. With or without friends. But you have to play it with friends for more fun D Full experience with controller. Game is little more expensive than someone wanna give but experience is more than price of this game.UPDATE Game get you some more fun with events like Halloween and X MAS )
1;This game allowed me to drive very fast and moan very gayly into the microphone for my teammates and foes to know that I have scored a brilliant goal and initiate the celebrations.My favourite aspect of the game is rear ending my opponents god that feels f**k'n good. Pros Rear ending Playing with balls First touch 10/10I still can't control the balls once they are above my face it just makes it so hard.
1;I love this game to bits. You can keep playing it without (usually) getting bored and it's just generally loads of fun. Another really nice thing is that the DLCs are seriously cheap. Graphics are good and the physics are good. Can make you rage if you get dat ball stolen though. Oh and one downside the AI is pretty bad so try to stay away from that.
1;oh my god(long version) the main draw for me is how incredibly well done the physics are in this game. The mechanics are so easy to pick up and familiar yet so difficult to master and you better believe this game is capable of smash bros level moves and strategy
1;"""Well i don't play really alot of games but this one when I first tried it wasn't really fun to play.So ye I do recomend this game for all players that love team work games or loving car games. Even there is DLC for """"Beck To The Future"""" Car!!!!So my last words Really Must Buy it D"""
1;DO NOT BUY!!! read T&amp C'ST&amp C'S1. buy if willing to give half your life up to reach champion2.do not buy if you want to be sociable4.if you want a happy family stay far away fom this game3. if you want to keep friends that dont play this game... dont buy the game 5. this game is very fun however addictive and competitive6 realise 4&amp 3 are the wrong way round.
1;Didn't like it when I first saw it. Don't like soccer. Thought what a lame idea combine soccer with cars really? Waited 6 months bought it on sale just because I wanted to try it finally immediately addicted love it since 99 hours ) ! 10/10 would not like it again )
1;Its a game you'll pick up in 10 minutes and love for 10 hours straight but still be trash at.at hour 200 you might be getting good.at hour 400 you can say you've got some skill.at hour 600 you might wanna look at joining a amateur team.at hour 800 you could still be trash.at hour 1000 you're either on a competitive team or have erased all thoughts of the game from your mind.
1;Rocket League Is like spectating a little league soccer match where the parents cheer on their kids as the attempt to kick the ball around with their stubby legs and only manage to kick it a few millimeteres Is that moment when you're in a Bumber car trying to have a good time driving around until a complete stranger T bones you and uppercuts you against the wall. Is a hell of a good game 10/10
1;Been playing for about a year now originally on a friend's acc. I'm still not bored. The $20 for the base game is definitely worth it and the DLC just adds enough spice to keep you engrossed.The servers could use some work/upgrading but for a smaller studio Psyonix has handled the game's success extremely well.If you're into fast paced physics based gameplay give Rocket League a try.
1;This game is good but I think it's too easy. I myself am a proclaimed prospect elite player and I find that the game is too easy. I'm literally the highest rank in the game and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to go watch some Leafy videos he is really cool my favorite part is when he teaches us how to tie nooses.
1;"""You need to fix the ing Matchmaking im pretty new to rocket league and in ranked im comming up agains ing kronovi and like that.And before any of you start saying """"They just fixed it lol"""" you can put that up your arses.They havent fixed they've just said that to make everyone feel better.So take this message with great response Psyonix and eather """"Put it up your quot or """" ING FIX IT YOU quot Thanks )"""
1;Rocket League is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time and I believe that if you play with the right people you can have such a good time! It has a steep learning curve for the more advanced techniques but once you start playing the game a lot you will pick them up in no time! Strongly recommend what a game.
1;THIS IS SOO FUNNY. Even though this game is car football (soccer for some of those weird people who say it that way)this game is easily enjoyable. unfortuatly you find the occacional ragers especially dem russians from csgo tryharding the off on a really fun game. This can be funny because people just fly everywhere and sometimes if friendly fire is on just kill your own team when flying. overall the game i rate is a 8/10 for originality
1;Very entertaining. Matchmaking is decent so most of the games are played with people around your skill level. Easy to pickup difficult to master. One of those games that keeps on rewarding you for practice and dedication. It's just good fun. Local co op is a huge bonus. Excellent game.
1;Step 1. Choose carStep 2. Drive at hyper speed at Giant soccer ballStep 3. Miss the ball completely crash into wall and curse at lifeStep 4. Watch enemy fly (like superman with a jetpack) and smash ball into your own goalStep 5. CryStep 6. Repeat Step 15/5 If you are willing to invest in flying lessons
1;I've put countless hours into this game throughout PS4 and just recently switched to PC and I love it. Such a well developed game and the developers have really shaped the community well. Can't say enough about how much this game has lived up to standards.
1;Its an Awsome Game! The start was pretty hard and I didnt got any good Shots but after a few Hours i startet learning new things. Now im a pretty good Player and I love to just go into a Match and have fun for some Hours. Its way more fun if u Play with Friends but its also Fun to play solo with Randoms.
1;"""Played over 200 hours on console and working on the pc now. One of the most most pure """"fun"""" games there has been in awhile. Grinded alone on console for months and had tons of fun. The started to play with friends and a whole other fantastic experience. Once you adn your friends get good the world is a better place. This game can make you feel so dumb one sencond and like a god in the next. Such an experience. Totally worth it. Some of the DLC is pretty good too"""
1;"""I've been trying to 100% complete this game ever since the new Inventory and Painted Items update came out.With my luck I've yet to even gather a painted item.I'm dying inside every game I play I only play with the mindset of """"please just anything for this achievement""""I've played nearly 100 so far since the update kill me.Love this game though every hour went deserved towards this unique masterpiece here.10/10 would not get painted iten again."""
1;Get ready to face a high skill ceiling game the devs made superbly tight in the corners!Fun as nothing else highly recommended just get ready to lose once you rank up if you're not doing training...Not really worth playing if you don't own a decent gamepad/controller...
1;I don't have much to say it's a fun game and also competitive I myself got it to have fun with friends and it has been doing that perfectly but you can also try level up and get highest rank in the game and still be having fun the good thing about this game is that there are 0 a few cheaters.7 8/10
1;I realized recently that I've logged over 200 hours in this game... Unbelievable. I never would have guessed it was that much which just goes to show how outrageously fun it is. Although I wouldn't rank it among my top 5 because I usually tend to enjoy story based games more in terms of fun for the money spent it's probably the best steam purchase I ever made. 10/10
1;This game is really fun to play with friends or even alone. They are updating the game really often with new game modes DLC and other cool stuff. I absolutely loved the prequel (SARBC) So hearing about a sequel was a dream come true and they've done such a great job at making this game. Definitely a must have if you like this kind of games.
1;"""Hey there!At first Rocket League is just fantastic and makes a lot of fun. It is very skillbased and u improve ur skill day for day and it dont stops after thousand of gamehours. You just need to try it.The Game has just one big problem and these are the smurfs if u get in """"winning streak"""" (just 2 or 3 games needed) you get 1 or 2 smurfs as enemies. You cant rank up so. If Psyonix fix this the game is just unstoppable."""
1;This game is like when you had an off day in school but in your delerious and confused waking state you completely forgot about it. The moment you arre beginning to pick out a shirt and remember you do not have to go that day... That moment is this game. You never ever want it to go away... And you have woody.
1;1. played it 10 min &gt stupid game2. tryied it with a buddy aigainst two random people online &gt great3. first bycicle goal &gt amazing3. Epic save &gt omg did you see that??4. areal goal &gt save replay &gt watch it again 5. play another 1000 games and then do it again
1;Piece of game that constantly has lag spikes and glitches. This game makes me want to grab it by the metaphorical testicles and just keep twisting so it feels a fraction of the pain i feel when the lag spikes and glitches constanlty happen in game. But 10/10 game though really fun and competitive.
1;Rocket League is an awesome game especially if you like racing games sports games and showing off. The charm of the game wears off very quickly but there is so much more to the game that it doesn't matter. (Within 1 hour of gameplay you're sick of watching your lame goals.) The skill ceiling is extremely high but watching yourself hit a double touch ceiling shot over the entire team is one of the most rewarding feelings. 10/10
1;its a great game you can play it over and over again just like eugenes mum solo or with friends its always fun and full of giggles just like eugenes mum so if you like eugenes mum and rocket cars then this game is for you!be good if the cars had there own radio stations along with different horn tune!p.s eugenes mum got ed by marc make sure your tested after playing!
1;The game itself is basically football with cars nothing very special but it sure is fun.It's quite well optimized 40 60FPS on a Low Medium end GPU from 2013.Also if your autosave fails I would recommend trying running Steam as administrator before playing or you will lose all your progress when you quit.2
1;Just get this game. If you want to have a bit of fun with friends over get Rocket League. If you want a game to play on a competitive level with new ways of playing always being around the corner to up your game get Rocket League. Look the point I'm trying to make is... GET ROCKET LEAGUE!
1;Hi psyonix I really like rocketleague but the last two months that i have been playing competitive i never ranked up i am still bronze one and i am really good can you please seee that problem because all of my friends have ranked up but i havent and i play the best of the all.
1;This is the only game out of my 25 year gaming career that has hooked me in so hard. PS4 XBone and Steam combined I have dumped 300+ hours of my life into this game with no regrets!!!Short learning curve intense competition throughout the ranks and every game is different. LIkely my favorite game of all time.
1;This game has it all.It turned a boring sport and made it cool with flying cars and a bomb for a ball.Postives Fantastic Controls Flawless System Graphics Are Great (Ohmahgawd da grass moves) So much customizationnn!! Developers supporting it post release Online is addictingNegatives My online teammates always suckkkkkkkkkk The season mode is well put together but not very rewarding to play..My Rating 9.5/10
1;One of the best games I have ever played. Its very well polished and i haven't run into any bugs. The servers are finally playable as my ping is usually in the 40s. 10/10 Would recommend if you want to get sunk into the game for the rest of your life.
1;soo let's start First of all this game is a car racing game with awesome boosts.There is an massive free update on every three months besides that you can buy dlc's if you want.You never get bored of this game it has a good community.The servers are always full.There are just soo many reasons to buy this game.JUST DO IT!!!
1;Plus + + fun to play+ teamwork is important+ awesome workshop maps+ supergood training mode with many options+ reasonable price Minus slow strange launching client. (it opens small window which is not answering after that it starts) toxic community sometimes lagging for no reason
1;Truely awesome game. Football with cars doesn't do it justice at all. So simple but at the same time really difficult to master.Split screen is also amazing which was one of the main reasons why I bought the game. Playing online it great but playing on the sofa with three other people us brillian. Also discovered that you can split screen this across mutliple monitors D
1;I recommend this game if you are looking for a fun game not to play competitively. The matchmaking system on this game for ranked is broken it apparently matches you with people of similar ELO... you will soon find out this is t as most of the players it matches you with cannot hit the ball.... like ever!But casual play this is great to play on your own or with friends and therefore I would say overall this game is worthwhile.
1;I absoloutly love this game. It's so much fun and the extras (hats boosts etc.) Everthing is a ton of fun with friends and i havnt had one bad game yet. The only problem i have with this game is the ranked solo option. I personaly feel that there needs to be a smaller map and a less time limit for the solo ranked play. Other than that I love this game and would throw any money at it if there was DLC )
1;It's a very cool game only 5 minutes for a ranked match so you are not constrained to leave your match when your mom call you when the soup is ready and if you have some friends who plays this game too say bye to your social lifeHave fun guys it makes all the difference
1;Rocket League is an amazing game. I know I shouldn't need to tell you that but it is true. Great controls great multiplayer system (although sometimes inbalanced!) and brilliant car customisation! This game is the perfect example of easy to learn but hard to master!10/10 would score that one lucky goal and tell everyone how great I am again
1;Rocket league is not only addicting from online to offline play but the heart and soul that has been put into this game and continues to be put into this game is obvious as you play. A new free map for everyone to play on comes out when each paid DLC comes out and the amount of stuff you can do in the game outside of standard gameplay is outstanding.
1;Rocket League is a fantastic game I always find myself coming back to play it and it is certainly a great game to sink hours into.Pros Lovely Visuals Nice Soundtrack Infectiously Fun Gameplay Great Support Post Launch Generally Very Easy To Find A Match Great Vehicle Customisation Good Offline Support Easy To Learn Hard To MasterCons Can be punishing when playing against more superior players. The item drops don't drop very often. Community can be annoying.
1;Are you serious? I politely complain about your unnecessary ambient effects ruining my fps and you respond with UNDISABLEABLE AMBIENT SEA CREATURES? There's a reason I don't care enough about this game to buy your t cosmetics and it's this kind of thing that makes me not want to play at all.
1;So it basically goes like this a scheme for every 3rd game You own the other guys in rank 3 0 or 4 0 then in the last minute they suddenly manage to get 5 random hits from walls ground or whatever and shoot the ball directly into your goal so that you lose the game even though for 4 minutes with your partner you were making some sick teamplay moves and totally own the game.Yeah pur skilz2/10 would rage and quit again.
1;Don't like sport games? Don't like racing games or RC Cars?Get the game anyway because it's actually really surprisingly proper good. it's easy to pickup and play casually or play competitively if you have ALOT of time.Cars in this game are purely cosmetic so players won't have any in game advantages or disadvantages which does make it easier to learn than other games.Easy to learn but very difficult to master.
1;Ranked matchmaking is absolutely horrible. I feel punished after I play two or three good games. Pairs me (just a pro) with two rookies/semi pros against two pros/vets and an expert for like the next ten matches. What the f*ck. Horrible experience. The game non ranked is much more fun because it doesn't rubber band so hard.
1;Dis game is instant fun. got only 10ish mins. you can pop into a game. and boom. you are already making a difference. with CSGO for example. you cannt do this you have to know what stage they are at in a game and how the enemy team works. 8/8 WUD R8 AGAIN Abraham Lincoln
1;I like this thing the only thing is MY TEAMMATES KEEP SCORING ON OUR GOAL also START FLYING DO DO IT. LEARN TO FLY IN RANKED GAMES WITH A TEAMMATE THAT BEGINS TO HATE YOU FOR IT IT PAYS OFF. Its been 3 years and somewhere around 1000 hours since I made this review and my teammates still score owngoals.
1;This is a game I just can't stop coming back to. Game is great and the dev team keep releasing new content on a very regular basis. The new Rumble mode could easily be a separate game or a paid DLC but they released it for free. Easily the best bang for buck game out there. 100000/10 would play again and again
1;"""Very Fun and intertaing m80. Scrubs willb Rekt. 3goood5me. 8/8 Ign """"Gr8tm8 would r8t 8gan""""Oh forgot to mention that half the community are about 12 years old and play competitive when they shouldn't. (You can see for yourself) Real talk give the game a shot"""
1;This is seriously one of the most exciting and addicting games. You start off with the intention of maybe playing a couple unranked games doing some ranked and then maybe cooling off with Rocket Labs. This however as we all know turns into hours of ranked play until we finally get that phat Diamond rank up. I highly recommend the game and encourage everyone to pick it up don't even wait for it to go on sale JUST GET IT ALREADY!
1;This game didn't instantly get me hooked but some digging and I come to the conclusion that Psyonix has done a great job sustaining the addition of two massively popular gaming genres racing and football. Every game is different and the community has stayed positive and not gone spiraling downhill like the people in some of the other popular games *cough* CSGO...
1;"""We've all sat there thinking what would football be like with cars? Well heres your answer. Bloody amazing.Iv'e played FIFA but it's nothing like Rocket League The feeling of satisfaction after you hit that ariel goal or epic save is just awesome. Playing this game with friends is a blast and I definetly recommend this game to anyone that is considering/contemplating on getting this game.10/10 would fly cars into balls again.This definetly deserves the Award """"Just 5 more minuits!"""" )"""
1;Rocket League is an amazing twist to the world of soccer. It puts you behind the wheel of very powerful and awesome looking vehicles while also having the element of soccer still there. This is game for me is a 10/10 and i would recommend it too anyone that asked.
1;This is the simplest yet most deep game you can get. I am current just over 1000 hours in and I can tell that I'm no where near done learning. Theres more to do always room to improve. By far the most accessible competitive game out there. Worth the $20 though I would pay hundreds for the time I've enjoyed it. Buy this game.
1;Is this game good YesIs this game easy to learn YesIs this game easy to be mastered No you have to have a functioning brain and persistence to continue through your rut to succeed.Is it worth the money Yes if you like fun time with friends if you have no friends yeah stop reading this.Big Tip Friends make this game better.Plz play bby its sssaaahhh good.
1;A Man must ask himself. Does he like soccar? Hell no no one likes that panzy sport. BUT. Sometimes a game comes along with rockets and cars and hats. At that point and only then is it a man's duty to buy Rocket League. DON'T LET YOUR LEAGUES BE LEAGUES. Just Buy It.
1;excellent physics handling control match making and australian servers. very streamlined experience with all the options you could want. you really couldn't ask for better execution (although that's a bit of horse as things can always be better). but it's extremely well done.more personal opinion use a controller.

1;amazing game 8/10 really addicitive fun and really thought out. Wow thats actually what I thought of the game on January 9th 2016 but to be honest the gameplay is fun and the mechanics work nice but the gameplay gets to stale and the loot box system gets a little to addictive although when cross platform comes out im down
1;This is the most cancerous game i've ever played. I've never been this fustrated about a ing cancer game. It's always the same ing t there's this one that flies to the ball like a ing with his ears straight up in his . I recommend nobody to waste any money on this cancerous piece of ing game. This game really just gave cancer in the i now have cancer. Thanks for reading. Please donate to GIRO 500 let nobody die of this piece of cancer. Thanks for reading
1;Are we supposed to receive a cosmetic item after every online game we play? Because my friend and I always play together and he always recieves an item after each game while I get an item every once in a while. I don't know if it's a glitch or if it's supposed to happen but I would like to know. Otherwise this game is probably the best game I've seen in a while and I can't wait to put a few hundred hours into this game. By the way I play on a potato so if I can play you can too.
1;"""Rocket League is a psychological racing game players often experience commendations and abuse through the game's main feature Chat.Pros of Chat What a play!What a save!Great Pass!Cons of Chat $# %!Calculated.OMG!Players will find themselves in a mixed feeling of Nobility and Worthlessness. If you manage to overcome the psychological battle you might be able to achieve a myth called """"Scoring a Goal""""."""
1;"""Rocket League is basically completely physics based football/soccer with rocket powered cars. The aerial goals are done by jumping pointing the car up and boosting. There's nothing else. There's no """"kick ball"""" button or """"pass"""" button. Only car control and physics which is what makes this game so unique and challenging."""
1;My Aunt was seriously sick.She needed an immediate operation to save her life. Everyone in my family put all our money together....We were 20 dollars short. I found a twenty dollar bill on the ground 2 hours later and bought this game The best 20 dollars i ever spent.RIP Auntie Beth.
1;Definitely within my top 3 favorite games in my library!After 120 hours of gameplay I've no doubt there will be many more to come. 10/10. Recommended to buy even at full price.EDIT After almost 300 hours on this game all I can say is BUY IT. You won't regret it. It is entertaining like the day I bought it. This game is extremely fun and the devs are awesome.EDIT2 Almost 1400 hours in. Still having a blast with this game.
1;Amazing game in general reaching game of the year (dunno which year) and amazing for its price range. Definetly reccomend to anyone looking for a game that is easy to run on their pc i play it on igh settings and i have an all in one. GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;I have nothing but respect for this game. Awesome game! Might induce dangerous levels of stress...but it's all good. ...I highly recommend playing this game. It is amazingly balanced and has a rare element that hasn't been seen in many games for years. 11/10
1;This game is only fun if you play it with friends. If you play the competitive game mode without your friends its a game of luck. You have to hope for the best when you go for a save or block and hope that you score when you shoot. At least when with your friends you can communicate and have some fun. Its a good game but it needs to be more skill based rather than luck.
1;Have been playing this game since January and it's currently the only game I play when I have time. The game's concept is simple to pick up for new players and requires a large amount of skill as you go. The matches are only 5 minutes so it's an easy game to play when I don't have much time but it's easy to lose 2 3 hours in the game without being aware that it has happened. Would recommend to everyone.
1;"""It's all about the 5 minutes of the game what will you learn in those 5 minutes? Either to do aerials or just simply hit the ball. Then you're learning angles then you're learning how to do tricky stuff in aerials and how to combine those to make a goal deserve 4 """"Wow's"""". That's rocketleague. A game where you want to impress and win with your goals at the same time. It's a beautifull game . Thanks for making it psyonix."""
1;Why is Rocket League a great game for you.... PRO Great gameplay Very competitive Matchmaking (1vs1 2vs2 3vs3 4vs4) Easy to pick up and a hard way to master Good graphics Cool DLC's CON !Sometimes! a bad server connection I like Rocket League and I highly recommend it )I hope there add alot of free DLC's.10/10
1;So there are too many easily offended losers in this game. played sports all my life and there is always a level of crap talk and to get banned for saying someone is garbage (because they are) makes this game way to childish for me to play. i have put too many hours into this game to let these stupid people at psyonix ban me for what talk get out of here. turn your chat off if ytou cant handle some crap talk.
1;"""Rocket League is a great game to play casually and competitively. I've had lots of fun and so have many others. The controls are pretty easy to learn and the game runs great. The community is unique and made up of very """"special people"""". Rocket League is a must have."""
1;BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED!!!The most fun game you'll ever play. But this is a game which ishard to master. there will be times when you'll be elated with a victory and times when you'll be frustrated and curse this game when someone better than you beats you. practise practise practise and you'll start having fun!!!
1;Gets in Serer. Gets yelled at by team mates because I can't ariel since I'm prospect 1 divison 1 with 2 days played. Gets in to another server and I get yelled at since I can't hit the ball. Goes in to Hockey and am a boss at that mode. They need competive hockey!! 10/10 MY RATING THIS GAME IS THE BOMB!!!!1000/10 IGN Rating Amazing!
1;I just bought game.6 online tries.All failed because of connection problems...Seriously wtf is that? It's not even possible to complete a match. Incredible lag.Asking for a refund. You better fix it. It doesn't worth more than 5 dollars for playing singleplayer.Game? It's just fine. 5 stars. Your servers are terrible. Don't hesitate to invest money on multiplayer. Hire a team for online servers. You got enough money.
1;This game... is the most action you'll ever get when you combine football/soccer with RC Cars.Rocket Leage is the perftect mixup of two completely different things mashed into a video game. The game as to specs handles really well. Even on a Core Duo handles on 60 FPS max settings! Its really fun to play with friends or even alone.
1;Very simple and fun! I recomend this game to people that LOVE to customise their character but what I enjoy about this is that you can get painted items that look diferent from the normal item you usualy get from trade ups to unboxing them!the only downfall about this game is (my opinion) that their is not enough universal decals! BUT overall this game is fun since its a very creative game to make! Keep up the work psyonics! I rate this game 10/10
1;It's so much fun and is pretty hard to master but once you get your car flying you won't want to put the controller down. The devs are great aswell with all the new modes and arenas that get added not a fan of the crates and keys though. But it's definitely not a turn off as they are optional and it is not pay to win. 10/10 on the fun scale alone.
1;Dont play this game unless you have friends to play with. you will never get good. you'll always be alone... and if you WANT to get good at this game you will never be able to because you're friend will never play. so you'll forever be stuck playing by yourself with no friends that wish to commit to this game like you do. I love this game... but I have no friends that actually want to play. it's a 5 star game... good luck finding good dedicated friends to play with you...
1;Product received for free. Even if I am not an expert at the game it's still extremely fun. Playing together with my friend at his house is such a blast. Imo everyone should buy Rocket League. Played it on a Free Weekend for myself plan on buying it this friday.
1;You will never get bored of this game why 1. You always have something new to learn2. Great to play with friends3. Community isnt toxic4. You can always change the game up and make new and exciting modes5. The esport scene is huge and is very entertaining to watch
1;Quite possibly the single best videogame since Rocket Jockey. That's a game no one played and which was a million years ahead of its time back in 1996. It was so advanced that we still don't have a sequel. Because God is dead and the videogame industry hates videogames. And happiness.But yeah Rocket League. Buy the hype. Buy the game. The trailer is very profoundly but the game is very much THE Also you can put hats on your car. No really. You can.
1;Pros Fast PaceEasy to learnLots of customizationsNot P2WPretty Epic and alot moreCons Playing with people on PS4 sucks they cant read the chat or hear voice chat ( afaik ) Getting matched with Veterans that are quite badNot much else great game on a good price!
1;i really really really really really really really really hate football and cry football players who fall on the ground start crying for that do all real lfie football players but after this is said then if you like Board football or want a fast easy game then you should get it a try and i didnt knew it was so fun also thanks god for weekends on Steam
1;Good DLC strategy of giving out freebies with every paid pack unbelievably addicting and tight gameplay and I can't stop playing even though I'm erratically terrible.Must play must buy.2016 RL isn't still as good it's MUCH BETTER. May be GOTY 2016 too.
1;Fun competitive and Beautiful! Looks easy but it takes time to learn the mechanics and become good at the game but it is worth every minute of your time. Every match is different and fun at the same time! Trust me you won't be bored with this game. Good to play alone and so much fun to play with friends.
1;All my friends say that I'm too into this game but I think it's reasonable. Psyonix does a pretty good job of listening to its costumers and updating the game. The simple mechanics still offer so much depth and fun. I reccomend to play with friends but even if not RL is a great game.
1;Rocket League is a very good game many amazing features and has different types of game modes. The only problems I have had is a few of the newer maps not being like the originals. The main map in particular Neo Tokyo is very good but makes the player have to adjust massively towards the terrain difference. Overall an amazing game and would reccommend to anyone. Make sure to use a controller though otherwise it is extremly hard.
1;super fun game. Was very skeptical and was worried it would kind of suck but luckily I gave in to all the great reviews and feedback of how fun this game is. I did not think I would like this game as much as I do. It's super fun and very challenging but rewarding when you make those great plays.
1;"""This game is one of those """"gems"""" I've purchased over the years. At first I wan't interested in the game too much since I really am not a fan of soccer games. This takes soccer to a whole new level there is so much more to it than what first meets the eye. There is the ground game then there is the flying game it takes the entire game to a whole new level. I highly recommend this game at full price or on sale doesn't matter. It's one of those must haves."""
1;is physicly impossible to hit the ball when you start. You join a game and find that you cannot get higher than 10 points. You train a bit and find that now you can hit the ball. You train some more and overtime you are now a pro. This is rocket league. practice.is.key
1;This is by far my favorite game I've ever played. It's simple challenging addicting and it's a ton of fun. I play with my friends often and we have some great moments on this game. I definitely reccomend this game to anyone who is contemplating buying it or not
1;Oh so much fun oh so much hate.Wether you like Soccer with cars or not this game is fun and pain at once.Worth the price? Definatly.Ever get gud? Maybe after couple of hours. (hunderts)Ever gonna get bored of it. well couple 1000 of hours will do.So have fun playing but dont get mad. At least try not to. D
1;Rocket league is a game that you can not be naturally good at. Theres mechanics that you need to learn and understand. You learn something small and it makes you want to learn more and you practice. The game becomes a lot more fun once you get past that beginning phase of being bad. But the thing is even the learning experience is fun. You are constantly getting better and looking forward.
1;This game is good and I would reccomend. You can either sit down and relax and have fun with your friends in casual or you could take the game seriously and play competetive. In competetive you may encounter some people with a higher skill level than you and that may be frustrating but at the end of the day the game is still nice.10/10 would play again.
1;Buy this game.I mean who dosent want to get ing Tag teamed by the Batmobile and a bloody Delorean. But be careful kids this is a terrorist simulator. You are being trained to use vehicles to deliver explosives to your targeted area on impact and blow yourself and others around you sky F****** high.
1;Well its hard to get good items without paying like import bodies or rare and mystery decals. I think you should add an item drop depending on the score you got on a competitive game. What am I trying to say is if you get 0 500 score you get a common item. If you get 500 1000 you get uncommon. 1000 2000 rare. 2000 3000 very rare. 3000 4000 import and 4000 10000 black market.
1;I'm voting this game for the 5 minutes award. Why?Because this game is still one of the best games out there. I bought it around a year ago. And after these 365 days I still have fun playing it. Because it's just one of the most addicting games. Especially when I play this with friends it's incredibly hard to stop..
1;This game was good up until all of the 12 year old gods came along. how are 12 year olds so good at the game!? idk. the new crates and drop system is cool they update the game constantly and the developers are always on reddit if you wanted to chat with them over all its a pretty great game. 10/10 Grand Champ
1;Such an addicting game that will leave you always coming back for just one more game then another..... Crate RNG isnt the best in my opinion but that shouldn't be a problem for the vast majority of you who won't buy keys. Definatly worth the 14.99 price tag
1;Its a good game and is a lot of fun but since the latest updates my game crashes randomly when starting a ranked match. Starting the game up again does not let you join in the game session again and gives you a 15minute penalty.. That kind of sucks as it happens 1 or 2 times every hour and ruins the fun of playing ranked matches.. If that is getting fixed i can completely recommend the game. BTW i already repaired and reinstalled the game.
1;I loved the way that Psyonix implemented the hitboxes and turning radius of the cars to make each one a little bit different instead of just reskinning the same car. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a challenging but fun way to play soccer.
1;Great multiplayer game with excellent window of gameplay times (5 minutes minimum up to 10 probably in OT). Wish more people would be online more often but with the only content changes being new cars based on crappy movies you work with what you can get. Sometimes the lag outs get you good but other than that its a good blood pumping game with fun times with friends.
1;Product received for free. This game is very fun and does not get tired after a couple of hours playing it has more mod than just classic. Occasionally when you have a camera on the ball so when the ball moves from side to side you will start to shake your head. 9/10
1;At first glance it is childish and simple game. Maybe it's true but this childish and simple game is one of the best independent games. Great simplicity of playing millions of combinations to create the appearance of a car good graphics. All this makes Rocket League very good game that you can not only have fun playing it but you can also have the satisfaction of playing or even relax. I highly recommend Rocket League not only for children but also for adults.
1;Played this game for a long time.It's honestly really good. The new rocket pass allows players to get decryptors and open crates for basically playing the game.It's a really good game it's not pay to win because the best car is the Octane which you get for free.You can buy things to make your car look good. But it doesn't help in game.Overall really good game. You sometimes run into toxic people but you can toggle chat off. Yeah.Overall my favorite game.
1;Really fun and engaging. Heartbreaking and frustrating at times due to lack of my skill and the ones of random teammates. Nevertheless this game always makes me come back for more.Beware of the key system though. U can spend quite a lot of money on this game.
1;I've bought this game out of curiosity with the humble bundle (about 1 month ago). I've been playing this game ever since. It is just awesome the developers give so much and even the stuff you can buy is reasonable. It makes a lot of fun especially with friends. And the cars are well balanced i don't feel like there is anything unfair in this game.10/10 best game bought in years.
1;This game is amazing! All you have to do is put in some time. Dont expect to be good until atleast 50 hours played. Every single rank you progress in is a COMPLETELY. DIFFERENT. GAME. it gets more fun the higher you get! D would reccomend this to anyone of all ages )
1;I can say that this game is insanely addictive and fun for anyone! I have over 1100 hours in rocket league and would advise you try to get your friends in on the action. Friends will make any game more fun but for rocket league it has a whole new meaning. Would recommend this game to anyone!
1;This is by far one of the best games I have played. It never seems to get old or dull especially when you have friends to play with. The new road map is especially exciting! I am most anticipating the decryptors where you can open crates for free. Even though the items are not tradable it is worth it! Highly recommened
1;Firstly i would like to say that the graphics of this game are excellent. Watching it on youtube was also entertaining. At first you will get annoyed at missing the ball and getting scored against shortly after like i did but you will eventually get the hang of it )
1;A very fun replacement for Grifball. The AI is brain dead so don't play them. Hop online play it and suck for the first 100 hours. You'll have good games and some bad ones. By the end of it though you'll know what you're expected to do and there's no feeling quite like pulling off a perfect pass that sails right in front of the net for your teammate to slam home. I highly recommend if you have the time to put in to it.
1;This game is one of those games that you can put hours into and still not master. It is easy to learn but hard to master. It has a deceptively large amount of depth with a high skill ceiling and that's how I think all games should be. Above all this game is fun regardless of skill level age or interest in real world football. I believe this is a game almost anyone will enjoy and I strongly recommend everyone to try it out as you get a lot of hours for a relatively small amount of money.
1;"""This game is way too addicting for one's own good. Last night I played for 7 straight hours and 123.4 hours in 3 weeks. this is insane. I just say """"one more match"""" and it turns into three hours! it's insane! I have to turn down my video settings but it runs well and plays great"""
1;Rocket League is fun.No other ways to put it.It's fun when you just start if you dont take it very serious. Fun as a little game to play with friends.But oh my my if you take it serious. If you are a real competitive player you'll have the time of your life.
1;Lots of fun to play with friends! So far I only found that there is a slight problem with the server. About every 30th game I get disconnected or have lots of lag even though I have a normal ping (30ms) and have no problem with accessing steam or youtube at that same moment. Even with that I would recommend people to buy the game and play it with friends since it covers all its mistakes with endless fun and excitement!
1;It's FIFA with cars what's not to like? FIFA that's what but rocket league is cool!Just don't be a ball chaser...and don't hit the ball if you're sending it to the center of the pitch or towards your goal!! Have fun and don't play ranked until you're actually good!13/10 would play again!
1;I always tought what fun could it be to play a car footbal game over and over again well 150 hours later I can honestly say its fun! It's easy to play hard to master which makes it quite fun to play. It's really a challange to be really good at this game. Would reccomend.
1;Amazing game I've had it since beta on PS4 and was actually very good at the game and could have been good today but I fell in love with siege but games like that had many issues left unfixed and psyonix kills iron maintenance so this is a very great game and I really recommend it
1;Rocket League is a great game but if you are from asia south america uae or africa your ping will prolly be when playing competitve Youll usually be connected to an American or a European server which usually is about 100 ping over rall ruining your experience unless youll like playing single player or casual.
1;Broom Broom Beep Beep despite this game being extremely frustraiting at times with smurfs and toxic players it is fairly fun being totally honest is you dont care about winning or losing and just want to fly a car around then get it! But if you are extremely competitive then be ready to push through the smurfs and be 100s if not 1000's of hours into this game!
1;A extremly fun game for gamers who loves cars or football.No matter if you are a casual or more a competitive gamer this game give you both.It has limited singel player options so thats a minus but this game overall is fantastic!Play and enjoy with/against friends for fun or team up and rise to the top.
1;Get it! IT's is very worth it for the price. I only have 11 games and this is the best it takes the living competitiveness out of you. Got it two weeks ago and played 39 hours on it already..... DLC are very cheap also. (Hint) want it cheap? go to LINK REMOVED
1;700+ Hours so far and still may be stuck in platinum 2 surprising casual players when I say it but I still love this game and always play it on my off time or when people aren't on. The skill cap is really high so the game is always improving with new mechanics being discovered. The game doesn't require people to pay money to enjoy it either you can still get stuff just for playing the game enough and trading towards it if you really want to. 5 stars for me
1;I really enjoy Rocket League. It is the perfect embodyment of easy to play hard to master. It is brilliant for having friends over and playing even if your friends aren't gamers however if you play for a while you can find yourself doing crazy aerial maneuvers and scoring insane goals. Definetely a good game to get!
1;You are Semi Pro and you think you are doing really well. But when you do a duel game you realize you suck. Reapeats trust me. Very addicting game though trading with others is fun and trying to become really good. GET IT NOW WHILE ITS ON SALE. Even if its not on sale its still worth.
1;Rocket League or how to Jump and drive around doing absolutely nothing for the first 10 hours you play this game You dont even hit the ball Actually this never changes if your a casual player ) Play Neo Tokyo or any Rocket Labs Map if you're hitting the ball too often If thats not enough go play with the Mutators and you wont do br&gt 20/10 would not hit the ball a single time again
1;Definetly worth $12. Very fast paced game. There isn't a learning curve which is nice but it will take a while to get everything down. It's a very exciting game. I always go crazy when I make an insane save or crazy pass. If you want a fast paced competetive game this is it. BTW I play this by myself and its still extremely fun.
1;I love Rocket League (200+ hours) and no game is the same. Every player has his/her own play style and it is difficult to adapt to beat them. This game is definatly more fun with friends but even without them this is one of my favorite games of all time and it never gets old.
1;Sometimes the A.I. can be intolerable and the match making is not ideal but this game set out to achieve something and it did it exceptionally well. I recommend it to everyone I meet.These Devs are doing a great job! Very happy purchase worth every penny and DLC.
1;Don't read any negative reviews MMR was reset for season 3 so I wouldn't recomment competetive at the moment until everything is more stable. Game is amazing though can play for 5 minutes or for 2 hours. That's the simple beauty of it paired with the game and DLC being very affordable. It's worth putting time into the freeplay and training modes too especially the aerial training.
1;Absolutely ing amazing! i got 90% on all star goalie training 8 20pm 5/1/2018 and i cant belive it! still cant how well i've gotten so far! the game is so worth the 15 quid. skill beats skins. fav car octaneAlso i love the game but some of the teammates are traash please get better online players on 2v2. make sure to train console players! its annoying when i lose every match to them failing easy shots and saves
1;This is a game that requires pure skill and timing and is perfect for all you soccer fanboys out there such as I. ) Great competitive play and beautiful graphics. Also a very likeable variety for customization items. Plus it's only $20.00! Add me if you want help with basics or a challenge to play against D
1;Product received for free. Rocket League is a great elo ladder game! The concept is perfect and is effectively executed. It also runs very well considering the graphic quality. To anyone who enjoys working your way up ranks then this is a great game for you!
1;The game has its ups and downs but its ehh ok. all i ever get in multiplayer is just absolute trash teammates that just pass the ball to the enemy team. i play competitve and i get nothing but absolute trash players. overall i recommend this game just dont solo queque
1;If you don't want cancer don't start playing this game. Let me give you the rundown.Cons AddictingPainfulTurns you into a masochist ToxicCancerousPros Turns you into a masochistPainfulI can't stop playing this game even though I hate it. It's one of the worst experiences I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.
1;Really good competitive game Esports ready very difficult to master. Theres alot of toxic behavior but luckly you can change chat options to team only and you can play without fret. I've played since the realease but don't expect to beat me ) stop by my twitch channel anytime to challenge me! Just type in my name see you in the arena!
1;This game is pretty fun if ur playing casually or ranked in a group. HOWEVER never ing ever play ranked duos or triples alone. I've gotten matched with decent non toxic people maybe 10% of the time and toxic ing mentally people without full use of their hands every other game.
1;Rocket League is a awesome Game.The graphics are quite wonderful you can customize your car A LOT and every Game is different.It is of of those Games which are really easy to learn but really hard to master.Another awesome Thing about this Game is that you have a really recognizable Learning Curve and that you are proud of yourself each time you finally manage to do something that you trained hours and hours for.btw sorry for all kinds of grammar mistakes i'm german.
1;This game is absolutely awesome!. I love this game and it never gets old just like my other games.First i was like whaaaa??!! Then after some time i was really enjoying myself. Not only you can play online you can do many tricks and skills and do custom matches Much more too!
1;Rocket League has a challenging 'Stairway to Heaven' skill curve but is an utter joy to play once you're hooked combining mirror polished gameplay with true team dynamics that rival any professional sport. Rocket League is literally one of the best video games ever created.
1;I'm personally not a fan of any games that have a focus on cars however this game is just so much fun to play.When I first got it I spent hours on it trying to improve.Not only that but it's a super casual game so if you have a hectic life but need something fun to just play definitely check this game out.
1;After playing for a little bit ive realized this game is all luck on not getting ps4 players on your team because for some reason they like to lose and dont I know how they get to platinum. Thats for comp other than that the community isnt as bad as others.Dont get this game if you dont like soccer also. Kinda have to say that cause I had a friend buy it and say he hates soccer
1;Probably the only game on Steam that's not full of t. The game concept is great and the community is friendly compared to other competitive games on Steam. The prices of skins aren't exaggerated as other games like CS GO or PUBG. The best experience you get is when you play with your friends even tho playing solo it's still pretty fun. I recommend buying this game.
1;This is one of those games that becomes more and more fun the more you play it especially when you hit that first shot with your car from high above or when you come in at high speed and manage to save a ball in the last second.Yes online there is lots of people complaining when you make mistakes and lots of them give up really easily when you make multiple missteps but if you ignore there complaints and just enjoy the excitement in those moments then it can be great fun.
1;Product received for free. I've been following this game since it launched and it has yet to dissapoint. The servers are a bit iffy at times but other than that the mechanics are great and the community is overall good. Great game for playing with your friends or just playing alone. Probably the most fast paced and skill required game I have ever played but once you aquire the skill aspect of the game the bonties are plentiful of what you can do with it.9.5/10
1;rocket league is a fun football game it has its down sides sometimes like u cant score or lag but its good once u know everything and well there's nothing wrong with it except u have to buy it and not have it for free i recommend a 100/10 U SHOULD BUY IT NOW!
1;Rocket League is a tightly crafted fast paced chaotic dive into the world of sport and being along for the ride in this early stage is liberating witnessing tactics evolve metas born and Rocket League celebrities heralded as they soar above the pitch effortlessly landing aerial connections while attracting thousands on Twitch.http //www.permanent beta.net/reviews 1/2015/7/21/rocket league
1;I love rocket league so much I recomend it to everyone all ages. Its an amazing new concept that isnt seen anywhere else. The team is constanly updating the game and there is a huge player base you will never sit and wait in a lobby to play in a match. Jump strait into an amazing game you wont regret purchasing it worth every cent.
1;Really good game with a variety of skills needed! Very challenging in some sort of aspect with a fun feel to it. Community lacks a little bit do bump into some of them kids who think they're amazing but miss the ball 24/7 im diamond 3 to champ rotating between them ranks and i can say i still love this game! As you can see by my hours it took a while to get there so dont let your self down practice makes perfect! you're all thank you &lt 3
1;I have a problem with Rocket League at one time I bought a xbox 360 controller to play rocket league but when I plugged the controller with the open rocket league I tried to use it in the controller but it did not work it was not enough to use the start button when I I pressed split screen appeared but I do not want it to appear split screen help me...
1;I love and hate this game all at the same time. It's incredibly fun and just the right amount of difficulty. However there are some quirks to the game that may never get fixed (weird bounces rediculous 50/50 losses etc.). Regaurdless of its faults I will always play this game )
1;"""The game is really good I can""""t say it is not.I have a lot of fun playing it but I feel like it is good to wait when the price of the game goes off a little bit.Because I wouldn't say it is worth of spending that much money on the game and if you are If you're planning to put money in the game there are boxes that you have to spend money for the keys"""
1;This is a great game. Always fun to play with or without friends. Although it may take some time to get used to the controls it quickly becomes addictive. If you strive for perfection in your play it will never get old. The only real con is that the ranking system seems to be arbitrary at times. 9/10
1;"""Product received for free. Game gei but it brought me closer to my lovers Bean and Botness. Bean and Botness are the cutest cutie pies there are out there and they are so sweet especially when Bean uses his signature phrase """"Nice one!"""" I almost squirt every time he says it and Botnesses statement """"Close one!"""" OMG everytime he says it he makes me want to skeet all over my monitor. With these cuties we have made the swagest rocket league clan out there """"Oof Gang"""""""
1;Try it for two hours if you like it then you'll love it later. Rocket League has amazing developers that listen to their community and are constantly adding to the game. Note Controller isn't required but if you have one use it.edit 1 year later Yep still ing great.
1;Great arcade action game fun to play with friends. It will take some time to master but the game is pretty good at matchmaking you with people on the same skill level. There are various game mode and they are all worth trying out!7.5/10Follow our curator page here https //store.steampowered.com/curator/6716139 Nox Noctis Gentis Obscurum
1;"""By far one of the best games i have ever owned in the last 10+ years of living! The newest eddition """"Rummble"""" is the best game mode yet exactly what i was looking for as the games was starting to get a bit boring after 200+ hours across multiple platforms"""
1;"""This game. This Game. THIS GAME. This game will show you how some humans perfer to act like dogs instead of humans. PLAYING FETCH! THE WHOLE GAME! """"OH PLEASE MASTER! LET ME TOUCH THE BALL!"""" People will forget that they have common sense and throw the WHOLE GAME! just to touch the ball.ONE.MORE.TIME. When i finally started getting my friends involved in the game. It was awesome. Plays were made people didnt just slam the ball to slam it. Play with your friends and avoid the dogs online!"""
1;Happily playing a game of ranked doubles....Scoreboard 2 1 with 30 sec to go looking good gonna rank up this matchDisconnected symbol comes up Oh god why now????Error connection to server timed out rank down 13 points banned from matchmaking for 15 min..........8/8 would smash monitor again
1;Do not buy this game please! You will never ever have a social life anymore PIt is very addictive. It is also a pleasure to see how many good players are around the world. It pushes you to play more to improve more.Simple idea but best result.Highly recommended
1;This game is amazing. Its a Easy to learn hard to master type of game. It takes practice outside of just playing matches to get better and really takes skill. So rewaarding once you have started to learn a skill. Learning how to airdriblle now and its insane. Great game
1;Easy to learn hard to master. Lots of cosmetics (DLC's and crates) that can be bought to make your car better looking and to raise your e ego. The game has got a bit bland for me lately but i would still recommend it to everyone looking for a competitive and fun multiplayer game.
1;This game is is amazing but your ban system is so trash its like a kids game now i liked that you could talk trash to kids but now its like we are all five year olds and spam the same thing over and over. The real world aint ganna be like this your ganna get cursed at. GET YOU TOGETHER ROCKET LEAGUE!
1;I have a few hours in this game so I think I may be able to say that this game is alright. I would recommend this game if you're looking for a fun yet competitve game. I would also recommend using a controller if you can that way you dont get 800hrs on keyboard and realize that Diamond 3 isn't easy to get out of without mechanical skill.I'm still playing this game nearly everyday! Reaching champ 3 was a very fun road I still believe this is one of my best purchased I've made
1;I've played Rocket League on both PS4 and PC. It is a very fun game to play with friends or without. You can play in casual game modes or hop into ranked and try to grind your way up. Psyonix game studios is very responsive to their playerbase creating new content that improves the game and its functions.
1;Absolutely fantastic game! It's a sports game that doesn't feel like a sports game when you are playing it. It's very addictive. There's a bit of a learning curve if you wish to get good at the game. Very fun to play against / with friends. Most certainly brings out the competitive side in me!
1;Product received for free. One of my friends in a Discord server gave me the code for a copy of Rocket League on Wednesday August 24. As of August 27 I've logged over 19 hours in the game and reached Level 15.He made a big mistake. I have been seen in Discord very rarely since then.
1;"""Except for the """"toxic genius stars"""" that rage quit or bully you when they are not happy with the outcome of the game this is amazing. Play with friends better.Did I mention the toxic gamers? Yeah.But still football with cars. And nitro. fifa man THIS IS THE REAL DEAL."""
1;Very addictive game 100% a good choice for the ones who wants a game to spend quality time and have fun. Actually when i bought the game i wasn't expecting such a great game but untill today when i hear the name Rocket League i fall in love like it was the first time i've played.
1;Installed it to play with steam controller on my TV.Damn it's fun mostly the ice hockey type. I don't know how many hours I played since then.Just easy to play one or two game before going to bed. I am not able to play games for hours in a row so it's just perfect.Hockey seems easier to play for me puck is easier to know where it's going compare to soccer ball.
1;"""I think it will win """"Better with friends"""" Because 1.Its casual2.It hasA lot of customizations with cars... Its fun to edit your cars or everybody make the same3.Every update new funny things to put on your car.4. a lot of funny mods5. I don't know what more to say )"""
1;consistent and solid physics that are easy to understand but very hard to master make for the perfect competitive game. Also has cool car customization and is frequently updated.Chinese player beware. Psyonix has partnered with Tencent for the chinese release of this game.
1;Nearly perfect game. After two years and 1800 hours on two platforms I can't see the end sight. The mix of slightly unbelievable but reliable physics with a meta based entirely around skill (no RNG) means there is literally no cap on the skill one can achieve. The better I get at the game the more I realize not only how much I CAN improve but that I still Want to. Anyone with a love of both sports and video games should try Rocket League though getting hooked requires neither.
1;For the first time ever the insane amount of anime weeabos furries mad russians toxic french people lame turkish kids leftover dumb scumbags from CS GO and many many more community destroying kinds of people DON'T ruin the actual game.Well done Psyonix. Well done.
1;Bought it on full price way back 3 months after launch and got many of the DLC's although they are strictly optional. I absolutely love this game enough to spend more than 3k hours on it. Only downside is a small part of the community that I hope will get better soon.
1;Bought this game last Christmas as a mind stimulant. Playing thise game 12 months later having played this game on every platform I can safely say. Buy this game buy this game and join THIS community. We want you here we need you here this game has expanded so much in a year next year. This game is gonna be yuuuuuuuuuuuge. goose
1;Product received for free. Would not advice playing competitive if u dont have friends to que up with cuz most of the time either u play with laggers who lagg the ball or play with someone who cant do anything like clearing or crossing the ball In general its a fun game but need improvements like ball lag when a lagger hits.ec
1;This is the game that I think made me into an actual gamer. Definitely the most hours I have ever put into a game. It is addicting to play over and over again to get better every match. Definitely got my money's worth out this game. And I havent even explored the workshop update that they added but I bet itll add awesome custom modes and maps for a long time to come.
1;I'm a total RL fan sexy cars little money spent and a fun time rekking peeps and learning from others. Met toxic peeps and cool peeps and made friends along the way its a pretty great community too. Totally reccomend if you like a growing experience for sick moves and cheap tricks lmao have fun with it though and dont e a heated bastard then its no fun for no one loooll
1;I suggest this game to all the people who like to trade are active daily (becouse the game takes a lot of time) like to play for fun or even competitive. Its a game in which i spend most of my time. Its like socer but with cars and a team of max 4 players.
1;Just keeps getting better and better. All other games could cease to exist and I would be ok. Super easy to get the basics down impossible to master like all of the great competitive games through the years.10/10 would be the game I would chose if I could only have one.
1;"""it came out for linux todaytbh this was the only windows game i played so i might go back to archanyway its fun whether you're a casual player like me or notand now i'm editing this review to say that i nominated it for the """"whoa dude"""" awardand now i'm editing this review to say that i nominated it again for another award"""
1;Do you have this game? No? Did you buy all the DLC's? No?Then what are you doing with your life? Go out and play some real soccer! You are too lazy? Then playRocket League! It's the funniest game ever and you won'tget enought of it!WARNING This game is highly addicting.
1;Pros Fun and addicting Great controls Tons of replay valueCons Community Community Community CommunitySeriously the community is terrible I highly recommend you turn off chat and social features before playing. Oh and don't play with randoms if they forfeit a game and you don't want to you'll have to deal with them trying to ram you constantly and try to bully you into forfeiting whilst also telling you to kill yourself in chat. Good Luck..

1;BOY HOWDY IS THIS A GOOD GAME. FAST FLYING CARS. BALLS AND HOLES TO PUT BALLS IN. TEAM CHEMISTRY AND SARCASTIC QUICK CHATS. ALL IN ALL A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE. SO FANTASTIC IN FACT THAT I TYPED THIS ENTIRE REVIEW IN CAPS LOCK. 10/10 WILL PLAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
1;This game is awesome. If you are into a good time and want to play with friends then this game is for you.I have played since late 2015 but just bought it myself. I'll tell you it was worth it.The game is very fast paced and amazing even if you are losing.SOme people might not enjoy the mechanics on crates but trust me if you rack a few dollars up it is worth the money.Overall this game needs to be played ASAP. Fakii Really Moist Bread
1;10/10 fast paced car soccer show down. This is the most fun I've had for $20. The extreamly high skill ceiling still keeps me engaged with close to 900 hours.Controller highly reccomended but not entirely needed if you're just having fun. If you're looking to push towards champion you need a controller.
1;Its a very fun game for the first 100 hours! After that it is a boring piece of garbage.I would buy if you are looking for a new experience other than fps games.Trading is fun until you get scammed. I got scammed and I stopped playing.DONT GET SCAMMED(ok i said enough)
1;This game was awesome I played it so little at first I didn't find it fun but as I began playing the game and getting better at it I found that I couldn't stop playing because every time I would do something cool and I am now addicted to it because of that.
1;One of the better multiplayer games I've ever played! The vehicles handle very well and once you get past some of your first games you begin to understand that there is some strategy to the game.The amount of DLC is understandable its purely cosmetic and the base game has enough vehicles and items to make your vehicle feel like your own.Its a great game to play alone or with friends!
1;I don't know how in the world can cars &amp football blend together but it works perfectly.the best (&amp probably only) football racing occasionally basketball sometimes hockey game I've ever played.+ Rocket League is about a hundred times cooler &amp drastically less pretentious name than Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars...I mean seriously wtf were you guys thinking back then
1;It's soccer. With ROCKET POWERED CARS. Nuff said.Sometimes you do run into salty emote spamming players but really that's the only complaint I have in over 50 hours of gameplay. Great for quick matches great for co op play with a couple of buddies and the fact that the dev team are still rolling out new content and game modes is always a plus. An easy recommendation.
1;I love this game. You don't feel it but you get better really fast. I used to go into the games and be worried I'd mess up. Now? I'm looking for chances to style on people. Nothing feels better then hitting that aerial goal.The competative in this game can get INTENSE. matchups seem to always be against people at or above your skill. Grab a couple of friends sit down and have a blast.there's only one downside to this game. the cancerous community. that's all hahaha.
1;This game is a lot of fun I have played it for a while and still enjoy it. Psyonix's practice of never selling advantages in the game (extra boost is all I can think of) of any kind is wonderful and the only factor that decides who wins is skill (and a little bit of luck).I rate it a 9/11. great game would play again.
1;"""Personally i think this game should win the """"Labor Of Love"""" award. This game has been out for a while but the developers never stop to amaze us every update with new content to explore and earn. They put alot of effort in to this game thats why the multiplayer hasnt died at all since the start this game is still very active very popular and especially awsome to play with friends."""
1;There's really no description that could explain this game properly its soccer with cars but not simple. The ammount of skill you obtain is unreal and aside from some server issues and toxicity from players who cant take accountability this game is fun. Most pro's have 5k+ hours in this game so don't feel let down if you're not doing so good under 1000 hours. It all comes with time and new mechanics are coming about every single day.
1;Yes i do like the game very much and im good at it but when im playing lately there is lag and on my screen im on the floor right about to get a save then all of a sudden im on the roof falling like where did it get the idea that i was on the roof? And the new starbase map is in my oppinion crap the bounces are so much different and the angles it has are bad i would suggest taking it our of ranked gameplay.
1;I owe this game a review really. Some of the most laughs I've had playing games were trying to learn rocket league and when you get good its still such a fun game. The high skill ceiling means you're always learning. New mechanics are still being found 3+ years after release which says it all.9.2/10
1;This game is absolutely bad because you can only MAYBE rejoin a ranked when your game crashes and you get punnished for the fault of the developers. Pls fix this Psyonix and your Rank system cuz its showning random rankes and you are Unranked rated the whole time. But it is addicting LUL
1;An Overall fun game to play with friends and a for hardcore fans to really dive into. If you're looking for a game that you can just have fun while further driving along the road of Self Mastering and Ultimate precision control look no further cause none of that is actually necessary to win! Hit the ball and just like real football this game is rather fun!And once you have that one moment that moment when everything goes right you'll be hooked on this game and you'll never look back.
1;Worth every penny.This game is one of a kind. It has to million unlocks and the graphics are awesome.The gameplay is amazing the physics are on point and the whole game runs really well.Also there's no fandom that has infested this game.It's games like these that we need more of.
1;Amazing game! Multiplayer brings out so many different emotions and makes or breaks you. The customization options are unbelievable along with the trading community makes such a great fanbase. I hope the game becomes better in the Esports community and continues to grow! Highly would recommend.
1;About the only thing wrong with Rocket League is that I'm nowhere near as good at is as I want to be. Like poker or golf this is a highly addictive pasttime where your own inadequacies could quite possibly drive you insane. If you like fast cars fast football or fast women* this is the game for you. *Fast women not included.
1;I hate you because you made me stay up till 3am on the first night playing until my fingers got sore and NOW I CANT SLEEPEdit A few months down the line I still play this game on a nearly daily basis it never loses it's replayability and I still haven't mastered aerials....I'm still in Silver/Gold. Save yourself the unnecessary worrying over whether it is worth it I promise you it is worth it. If you do not like it and I get 500 people rating this I will post a picture with a shoe on my head.
1;Pick up this game if you and your friends love knocking a ball around with a car!That being said...Bring friends along on this ride because it makes the game twice as fun but the game is also very enjoyable playing solo when your best friend can't tag along.Pros Fun game with periodical updates and new feautures to keep the game fun and making you want to play 'just one more game'Cons the fanbase can be...trolls.
1;Ok so I thought at first site this game would be total crap! DAMN was a wrong! This is the most fun you can have with your pants on!! I have only one hour of game play under my belt while writing this review and have to say this game was worth every damn penny!! You dont need to like cars or soccer to love this game!! This is the game to play when you dont know what to do with yourself!! 5 STARS!
1;This a very good game matchmaking is very good sometimes the graphics are amazing easy game to get to grips with as well. I have 1 massive problem with the training though if you want to do well you have to restart yes you can reset the shot but when you save it it doesn't count I find this really stupid to be honest you want to try and save all 10 shots you do in the end but 6 shots don't count because you had another go...
1;Great fun casual or competetive. Great on your own but best with friends.It's really fun game from the begining its not as fun but more you play better you get I would really recommend this game to actually everyone just dont give up after the first game it has a very steep learning curve . I will advise one thing is do the trainning !! It does help in the long run .The soundtrack for the game is amazing too Overall I give it 9/10
1;awesome game would recommend much like TF2 LoL/Dota MC etc just one of those games you can come and go to/from without hesitation wicked time killer as well if you really get into it my only question is why sometimes does my controller reverse its settings for no reason?
1;Product received for free. This is an incredibly fun game it's pretty much soccer but with cars it's well worth the money when i first got told about it i didn't think it would be fun at all when i heard it was soccer with cars that turned me off the game but when i eventually played it i thought it was almost the best game i've played so if you haven't got it yet i highly recommend that you get it.
1;This game is just perfect the way you start out as garbage and by Pro you think your getting good then someone scores a nasty airial goal on you and everything changes. youll spend hours in training just to hit a few airials. Next thing you know youve scored one in game by this point your at roughly 50 hours. 1200 hours later you BECOME the car you know exactly how to move in the air to hit every ball at the net and yet there are still new mechanics and things to improve on. Endless fun 10/10
1;Good...This game! I hate sport hate football... but ... this I love. Matchmaking works great you get better as you play to the point you playing like a dream. Communities ok some games you get the odd wan.ker with an attitude more so you find good matches with good play. Need a to waste your time? Looking for a no FPS for your down time... this is it.
1;Rocket league is my favorite game ever and there are so many reasons why. It has easy to learn but nearly impossible to master mechanics and I never feel that is's the game fault that I got scored on. There is also constantly new content being added to the game. Best of all there is no end to this game you could play for thousands of hours and still not be done with the game.
1;"""Pros 1. Great fun.2. Like """"car football"""" on Top Gear.3. Matches are only 5 minutes long. 4. Fairly inexpensive.5. Good replay value. (multiplayer)Cons 1. Servers are often down.2. People start quitting after their team goes down by 2 or more goals.3. Crashing fairly often at the moment.Definitely recommend it. Hopefully they get the server issues handled and maybe create some sort of penalty for quitting matches early."""
1;There are few things as satisfying as flying across the pitch in a rocket powered car in a carefully aimed arc to knock the ball into the opposing team's goal. The physics and gameplay mechanics are amazing and the alternate gamemodes are a lot of fun as well. I'd recommend this game to anyone who has a lot of free time or little need for sleep xD
1;"""Rocket League is an awesome game you probably think """"I don't like fifa so i probably don't like this."""" Wrong answer. Rocket league is an amazing race/soccer game where you actually need skills and practise for. After 100 hours of playing and over 30 dollars spent i give this game a 8/10 it eventually gets boring after doing the same over and over again. Buy this if you like the idea of playing soccer with cars if you buy this i recommond buying the version with a few dlc's in it."""
1;The game is great fun with Friends but its current Ranking System is slightly Messed up players that are supposedly in the same rank but the skill gap is clear and games can be so one sided. the only other critisim is the odd lag that happens randomly seems to be server lag or something. overall great game
1;I recieved a review key of this game from the devs.I have no idea why this is so fun but the hype you get when you make a great save or goal makes it so worth it. The game has alot of skill based movement but once you get the basics down and learn to coordinate with your team you should be good to go.The game could use some more arena types to vary up the gameplay a bit and there are currently some server issues for online multiplayer but its still a incredibly satisfying experience.
1;Product received for free. Play game Search online My opponent is veteran Get my kicked Oponnent mocks me About to rage quit Finally scores a goal oponnent get mad Get demolished About to score a goal again Get demolished Rage quits11/10 Would get demolished again!
1;Rocket league is a great game it's lot's of in multiplayer. But of course i have no friends so i can't really say fun with friends because i have none (. I recommend getting this game because the multiplayer and friends lol i'm so random. I'm such a lovable person you should add me on steam.i like hit ball in goals because fun with friends. 8/8 my phone number is 1800lickme come over to my house and we can go skateboards friend. D i love you all you precious little flowers!
1;It s a nice game that many people love. not without reason. it is beautiful and addicting. it s with hats so it must be good D it has a nice controls and lovely physiks.some things to improve tho. like more maps and gamemodes with power ups maybe. good game keep woring on it!
1;This game is really good i definitely recommend getting it. Its easy to be good all you have to do is learn the basics. Look it up on YouTube. If you want to see my YouTube Channel out I do Rocket League videos and a few other games. My YouTube channel is called The Irish Lord. Also this game is very addictive just to let you know. Ok guys hopefully I see on my YouTube Channel bye for now.
1;I played Counter Strike Global Offensive for almost 3k hours(and im global) and this game has addicted me even more then cs did what are you waiting for stop reading reviews BUY this game already.P.S would recommend to play with either an XBOX 360/One or an PS4 controller easy to learn but you won't regret it!
1;"""Although everyone you know is gonna shun you for playing """"car soccer"""" for hours a day this game is more competitive than cs go and call of duty combined. When you start you want to avoid online because trust me you suck. Watch some pros and kick some Overall extremely addicting which makes up for everything else that is problematic about it."""
1;I'ts a super fun game would rather it 9/11. Super fun and you can blow other people up so it's a good game I think Harambe would like to play it but he is ****ing dead so yeah... 2pac would love it too or he loves it? Thats the question is 2pac alive? We will never know! #d**cksout4harambe #2pacdrivebyshootedorfake? #rate9/11
1;You ever dreamed about Football with RC cars that can jump and boost?If so damn you are one weird guy.. Pros Football with cars that can ing jump and boost!No russian what so ever. (And i play on EU servers)Spam Nice shot! after someone misses a clear shot.Free maps.Hard to pick up.Cons Easy rage.Hard to pick up.Cars cost around 2$ each. (Not all of them)Toxic community.I'd say go and pick this game up! Worth every cent You will enjoy every minute with it!
1;I have happily wasted 80 hours in this game. AND IT WAS WORTH IT. Rocket League has a great concept of soccer/football and cars and its so fun. You will get on this game and go I'll just play one game but 2 hours later you'll still be going just one more game and thats the fun part.
1;Sick game! Play with controller not keyboard you will be limited otherwise in terms of skill and mastering techniques!They have sick items in the garage and keep on releasing new things so endless possibilities for our presets that we can make!However would like dlc maps from ranked to be removed DBest DLC's Supersonic mainly because of the cristiano wheels Batmobile the old one its just good Best Cars Octane Batmobile Dominus

1;"""Awesome game. Cross platform is basically a lie though. Sure you can queue up against opponents from Xbox Live (XBL) or Playstation Network (PSN). But can you party up with any friends you have on those platforms? Nope. So now my brother plays on XBL I play on Steam and all we can do is watch each other's games and think """"Why is there even cross platform if we can't play together?"""""""
1;I mean... You start playing.Then you get a little better.Then you win.Then you lose.Then you win.Then you lose.Then you win.You improve a little.Then you win.Then you lose.Then you win.Then you lose.Then you win.You start playing competitive matches.Then you win.Then you lose.Then you win.Then you lose.Then you win.You check the clock.Holy hell you didn't sleep.

1;Awesome game. Played since Season 1 and across multiple consoles/accounts.Ranked community not so much toxicity everywhere people getting off if you even you make a comment about there gameplay with autochat....even genuine ..theres a mute button but it doesn't stop the problem of toxic community.
1;This game is honestly one of the best competitive games I've ever played. Whether it be the community or the overwhealming desire to reach that next rank in competitive the game keeps you coming back. I play this all the time with my friends and I believe that it should be in everyone's steam library.
1;This game is absolutely amazing gameplay mechanics are phenomenal and graphics are beautiful. Rocket League is so action packed with new and exciting challenges that its hard to stop playing even for one day. I strongly reccomend buying this game because it is incredibly fun and enjoyable.Rocket League is one of my most favourite games of all time
1;Superb game absolutely spectacular. Everything from the looks to the gameplay just perfection. A couple cons are the fact that European servers are eh however living in Europe I still can play most games with no lag. Absolutely amazing so much fun all I could ask for is that 1) more punishment for leaving games 2) corss platform party set up and 3) better servers. Definitely worth the money even if you just play singleplayer
1;Yes but the game is very bad at setting up games. For example If you are Prospect 1 you always go against Prospect 2's or 3's. Also the gravity on the ball changes all the time in different arenas. Also some maps like the Starbase Arc arena's walls dont even follow physics some times.
1;Holy crap this game is good ever since this was given to me for pre ordering my steam controller this game has never ceased to capture my attention. Even now constant updates with more exciting arenas and vehicles keeps me enthralled.Rocket league is a rare one of a kind sports game.
1;If you like football and you like cars then you have found your game. Imagine playing football without getting hot and tired and also driving a car at the same time. You can even fly how cool is that?10 out of 10 all the way GET THE GAME NOW......................................

1;Rocket League is pretty hard to master at first might take weeks or even months. In the end It's worth It because you'll be a god or learn how to rotate for once. All I'm saying Is that you need to rotate. Just remember that and you'll be pretty set for the rest of your Rocket League life.
1;Super funny game!! really well done good graphics nice gameplay loooot of diferent objects to customize your car diferent type of gameplays. You can play online season (with diferent options like number of teams matches etc etc) vs mode etc... Really worth the money. GJ!
1;This is an addictive fun cool and sometimes hilarious game!!If you were to get any game on Steam get this one!In Rocket League you can Trade with others create and join parties play with your friends in parties open crates and PLENTY more!Hope you all have as much fun as I do playing this amazing game!!!HAVE FUN WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;Best game ever. It's so good the developers also think its the best game so they wont fix laggie servers DPros cars and balls ... thats allCons lagg decides if you win or lose10/10 would de install againPs. Still good game though but please add more cars so instead of fixing lagg servers
1;Surprised I haven't added a review for this game yet.It is awesome buy it. If you like lots of action then this is it. Strong multiplayer with lots of content being added consistantly.Added crates and keys for the people who like to go chasing down all the items too now. Just need to bash people in to keep me entertained for 350+ hours.
1;This game is one of the best and most competitive games that I have and will ever play. The game is designed so well and the controls feel great. This is some of the most fun i have ever had in a competitive game in my life. Rocket League is one of the best competitive games on the market and it is the most fun you will ever have especially if you have a friend to play with.
1;Rocket League is a very fun game. I have 130+ hours ingame and I cannot get enough of it. You can team up with friends and have a blast or climb the solo ranks. There are also bonus gamemodes like rumble and basketball. The car customisation is amazing and the DLCs are a great addition to the game. I would recommend this game to anyone.
1;Funny entertaining and good car football physics game. You can customize your ride from each team with alot of customizations including some really nice items. You can play also on ranked matches or play with your friends for more casual. It's a really good and competitive experience! Ever wanted to become Cristiano Ronaldo virtually? Well then this is your best chance to prove what you are worth with this amazingly fun car football game. Dribble Faint Shoot! 10/10
1;Recommend it but servers are so bad always get random ping spikes up to 300 packet loss and latency issues. I know it isn't my wifi because every other game runs extremely smooth. This is annoying because i cant really play anymore and have become really bad when i was getting close to leaderboards. Other than that excellent fun game
1;"""Greatest indie esports game ever. I've been playing rocket league since it came out for free on ps4 and have been playing it ever since. 10/10Edit """"screw this game i can't get better at it"""" *10 minutes later* """"mAyBe iM a BeTtEr PlaYeR NoW bEtTeR TrY fOr GraNd CHaMp"""""""
1;Very simple design but this game is by no means easy to master. That and the competitive nature of the game makes it incredibly fun and addicting. It's hard to be truly good at the game. To actually pull off manuevers that you intend on doing takes time and skill. Stick with it because the game is really something special.
1;You've probably seen the gameplay by now so just buy it if you think it looks fun because it really is. My only regret is not buying it sooner.Tons of unlocks + endless gameplay + populated matchmakingVery simple game with no BS microtransactions (which they could have easily done) it's a no brainer if you ask me.Edit Looks like microtransactions or atleast trading will be coming to rocket league.
1;What makes this game so great is that there is virtually no skill ceiling so no mateh how good you get there is always some skill you still havent mastered or a new skill or strategy waiting to be invented. This game can be incredibly triggering when you just cant seem to find the back of then net even thoug hyou know you should be able to but its also incredibly rewarding when you can literaly feel yourself getting better and climbing the ranks.
1;So simple but has a really addictive premise. Definitely worth the money I've spent far more on other titles but not played nearly as much as on rocket league. Variet is also great with a range of game modes and the option to create your own ridiculous maps. 10/10.
1;Psyonix EA Games... DLC.. DLC.. What?.. Yeeah! DLC!!.. ( _ ) + Good gameplay+ Good Graphics+ Good competitive+ Good customization+ Up to 4 player splitscreen (!!)+ Cross platform+ Much more to experience for yourself! DLC DLC DLC DLC (''Everything about base game. Not dlc! I hate dlc! dlc means not everything! dlc cost must be cheap!'') 10/8
1;200 hours in this game just came from ps4 gr8 game very fun much salt What a Save What a Save What a Save followed by ffs my tm8 is such a noob!!! Gr8 Buy 9.9/10 cons servers very inconsistent with ping thats alledit now got 1200 hours and can confirm its a good game
1;Soccer meets driving once again in the long awaited physics based multiplayer focused sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars! Choose a variety of high flying vehicles equipped with huge rocket boosters to score amazing aerial goals and pull off incredible game changing saves!
1;Me Plays casual and thinks he's god Me Thinks he's too god for casual and moves onto ranked Me Tries solo standard for the first time Me Gets the worst teammates ever Me Thinks it was just a one time thing Me Tries to find another solo standard match Me Gets bad teammates again Me Destroys everything around him in anger10/10 would play solo standard with bad teammates again
1;Rocket league was my first game on steam by now i played a lot of games however rocket league is so unique great soundtrack deuls are the best thing here i remember when this game only had normal skins no dlc no trading and black market those days were better but this game is still awesome and i would give it a 9/10
1;Posting this because of all the negative feedback. This game is amazing. The gameplay is some of the most fun you'll ever have and its so much fun to learn new things to win games. Some people in reviews say ranked isn't worth playing the game for. Casual still exists its just a fact the everyone plays this game for its competitiveness not its casual game modes.
1;The game is fantastic one of the best games I have played all year. Unfortunately it is almost impossible to get into a match because there are no servers. I could understand if this was the first day but 2 days after launch and still unplayable? I will fix this review once the servers start working consistantly but until then I cannot recommend this game.EDIT Servers are currently working great will update again if they go down. This game is fantastic and I highly recommend it!
1;"""Good game fun to play and rewarding to improve your skill but you can get banned for saying any swear word I said """"I'm s #$"""" and got a 24 hour server ban. This is one of the only problems I have encountered though and can be avoided by not using text chat. Couldn't Psyonix just censor words so you can't get banned so easily? Overall enjoyable game but it can get annoying being so restricted with the chat."""
1;I have never liked sport games. I have never liked car games.Then I got this game and I f*cking LOVED IT. This game is awesome.I wish I could be better. The only downside is playing on EU servers because my country doesn't have servers in our region (which sucks).
1;Simply addicted. There can be days when you cant score even once and days when you can win a match all by yourself its all about dedication and patience. At the beginning I thought I would get bored so fast with this game but when you learn how to do cool stuff you get more and more into the game. Now im not the best RL player for sure but I can say I'm quite decent (sometimes) and I met some nice people there. I fully recomend this game!
1;10/10. This game provides multiple game modes such as hockey and a circular map. Provides multiple free cars but the coolest ones such as the delorean from back to the future and the batmobile from batman vs. superman cost money (worth it). Also allows the player to customize their cars which is only half the fun. The game is more fun online and the maps are beautiful. Worth every penny i paid
1;"""You got money on Steam and don't know what to do with it ?Spend it on """"Rocket League"""".+ The Graphics+ You can tune your car like you want to have it Pimp my Rocket Car !+ """"It's like playing football but with cars""""+ You get """"trading cards"""" for playing (and it does have achievements)+ It's a must have action and fun !Cons There aren't any negative points.It's woth the money especially if it's on sale !"""
1;hello everyone Firstly i would like to introduce myself i am the oldgoalkeeper of turkish national team now i work as a trainer. I would reccommand this game to all you guys because It's kinda football with cars stuffbecause I have played real life matches this game is a nice getaway from all that without stress. As for you guys you'd better buy it. Or you can never be a goalkeeper in life nor in Rocket Leauge
1;This game is awesome but very hard at the beginning. My friends told me to buy it and im very happy to play it even if i have almost 700 hours on this game it never gets boring for me to play cuz i cant find hackers and now im pretty good at it and i have a black market item even if i got scamed 2 times with fake links or fake colors of items but this is not the game's fault.I will urge u to buy it cuz its worth 20 euros. (sorry if i wrote something wrong im not such a writer)
1;For casual and pro players alike this game caters to all. The epitome of a game that's easy to learn but incredibly hard to master. It's the perfect party game but also the perfect tournament game. It has an amazing UI and soundtrack to boot. It's a colorful game that everyone should try at least once.
1;Rocket League is one of the best multiplayer games that has released in a few years. It is easy to learn but hard to master not only that but you can approach the game for casual or hardcore play. The devs are great and will be supporting this game for a very long time. Do yourself a favour and get this game!Need a controller though as it's incredibly difficult with a keyboard and mouse.
1;EASILY one of the most addicting games... you get what you pay for plus 1000000 X .Finally a game that the devs actually give a damn about.. and also something different than your daily shooter..I can reccommend this to ANYONE i have played over 300+ hours and I'm still addicted.. Plus they always update the game with new cars new game modes new maps and all for very very cheap.. If you dont have the game BUY NOW!!!!!!!!! should be the highest rated game on steam !!
1;Personally I love this game and can't get enough of it however I do have issues sometimes when playing. As a mac user (I know boooo) I experience a lot of packet loss and latency lag and at this point I'm pretty used to it. The only problem I have that really gets on my nerves is that the game will crash while I'm in comp and because of this it doesn't matter how fast I relaunch the game I can't rejoin the match causing me to get banned for something I can't control.
1;It is truely the game I spend most of my time on simply because it is a great game especially with friends. Only drawback of this game according to me would be the amount of smurfs and salty players but that is usually the the problem with most games am I right?
1;I haven't screamed with excitement like this since I first played Burnout 3. If you like games that are complete chaos with a high focus on skill this is the game for you.I played it once and had to buy it. $20 is a lot for me but if you have buddies to play with you HAVE to get this game.
1;You should do these few steps to improvise the game.1) Better matchmaking. For example I don't like being in a team full of beginners or against a full premade team.2) Why can I join into a match which already started?3) And also some kind of punishment would be good for the leaver idiots.Thats all anyway the game is great and addictive D
1;If you Like Cars and Soccer... WTF are you waiting for to buy the game????!!!Edit Review This game is awesome... I really enjoy play this game its fun and as you start to learning the tricks and techniques becomes even funnier.I recomend you to play it with friends it will be crazy.buy it now!
1;This game is just amazing and it keeps getting better the more you play.Easy to get in insanely difficult to master. Rocket league is 3 years old and you will still find matches faster than games like OW. The community is not as toxic as in other games because the game is frenzy and you usually can't get your hands off your controller. But ocassionally you will get the stupid toxic salty person in your team.
1;super fun to play and i LOVE that it has a tutorial and freeplay feature so you can figure out how to work all the controls at your own pace. many games only let you figure out how to play right in the middle of a wave of zombies or something like that. simple and fun but not easy so there is plenty of gameplay in this one. accesible for the novice like me.
1;I've been playing Rocket League for countless hours there's a lot to say about this game but to make things short to sum up everything in 20 words or less this game makes me happy that's about it I am so happy for the success of this game and I wish more success upon it I've bought it on both PC and PS4 as well as all the DLCs because it's that good and addictive and again it makes me happy definitely recommend this game to everyone who haven't tried it yet
1;Cars and football don't mix in real life. Very different outcome in this reality. It's very tricky. A real challenge and super super addictive. A goal is a real celebration you'll wake everyone up with your shouts of joy. Can't stop playing. Seemed a bit pricey at time of purchase but no... it's been well worth it. Jump on it.
1;I've never really been into soccer or cars but this game is truly something else. Getting the controls down and hopping into games doesn't take very long to do. However the true joy of Rocket League that keeps me coming back is how innovative you can get with your gameplay based on your mastery of car control and players are constantly finding new ways to change the game. Definitely worth your money if you're looking for something to sink a lot of time into.
1;I really hope that all the other games act like this one because this game is the ultimate example to be imitated. Very nice gameplay sweet graphics nice sounds lots lots lots of customization and you'll be rewared if you choose to grind.Then again if you choose to play a custom game with some friends it is possible too. I really hope that the other games get as optimized as Rocket League. Best 19 99 I've ever given.
1;Easy and fun game right from the begin with hundreds of hours of enjoyment to follow. Runs so smooth even with less then decent computer. Matchmaking is super quick. You'll be playing nonstop with no interuptions. Graphics look detail and vibrant. There's so much to do and learn. Lots of items to collect. Theres nothing bad with Rocket League 10/10!
1;This is the first game I purchased when I first joined Steam. I've owned this game for 3 years now &amp each day I play it I enjoy it more and more! I love the different game modes and customization options. You really have to work hard to level up but it's very rewarding when you do! The ability to cross play is what will keep this game going for years to come. Great game!
1;I've played this game since its full release and put in (on PS4 and PC) almost 1500 hours total. Even though this game has lacked a new mode to keep the excitement going the physics and simplicity of the game make it a game I can both pick up and put down whenever and even play for hours on end. The community can be toxic at times but just disable chat )
1;Nice game community. I will still play this game but I expect the devs to do something with the matchmaking. It's not ok for a team of rookies who play their first match to face off a team of veterans or experts who have 1000+ hours played. I personally don't recommend buying this game unless you get it for 10 or 5 euros or you can still buy it when the devs fix the matchmaking issues otherwise you'll have to keep calm and enjoy getting beaten up by experienced players.
1;The game is basically soccar meets tf2 with cars. Racing cars around hitting balls into goals and all the silly hats your heart desires. Now the fun part is flying through the air doing a flip and dunking the ball into your opponents goal. Sometimes this game makes me hungry for donuts because I'm always thinkin' about dunkin. 10/10 even at full price this game is worth every penny.
1;awesome fun but also needs a lot of time and effort to get good. love the game to bits exept for one thing... psyonix's servers are absolute GARBAGE i am often put in games that are already in progress 0 7 or a game that is already forfeited before i even join. fix this and its the best game ever.
1;very fun very addictive...but season two has definitely made it less of both. without an objective points system being used to move up and down divisions we dont even know what our goal is. after every win I am just sitting and waiting to see if Ill move up a division but I have been stuck in the same division since season two started and I hate no knowing when I could possibly move
1;Perfect game if you don't like competition and soccer/football games. It's really a new way game that will let you keep coming back and enjoy with friends.Teamplay with randoms does occur a few times unlike other games. So even if you have no other friends with this game then you can still have some team experience.
1;This game is fantastic. Even with the 70+ hours I put in the game ceiling is so incredibly high. Plus its a blast to play with friends and the customization choices with building the car you want is so well done. Esports scene for this game is also really cool to watch. For 20 bucks this game is for sure a must buy.
1;Horrid chat filter than can result in a permanent ban. I don't trash talk but I think you should have the right to say what you want. Not to mention they will make it where you can't play the game anymore due to hurting someone's feelings.Edit You can still get muted for this.. However the game ban part is no longer the case.The game is fun and doesn't change every week. In other words it is consistently fun to play.I'll set my review to positive.
1;Incredible game. Very friendly for new players although once you get to the prospect/challenger divide you'll get crushed. Online play is smooth and seamless. Split screen coop is fantastic and so much fun. The DLC adds to the game but is not necessary.I wish there were more games like this for the pc allows adults and kids to play together easily.
1;Man I love this game! Super infuriating playing with random players during online competitive mode sometimes but somehow I keep going back for more. 645 hours total so far and planning on getting more.It is DIrectx 9 so runs really well on an older 2009 laptop of mine.Paying for keys and having them randomly chosen so you begin to get many of the same decals or tires bothers me so I have stopped spending money but the updates keep coming to this game and I would highly recommend.
1;&gt Bought this game&gt Casual non ranked cuz' fun and stuff&gt Play South American Server for nearly an hour.&gt Now im afraid of being killed by 29 brazilian kids and my mom's life is in danger for some reason.10/10 now I also speak fluent portugese.
1;Awesome game! Performance is on point! runs really smooth even on PC's like laptops with internal GPUs Intel HD Graphcis 4000+ Easy to learn hard to master. Can be competitive but you also have tons of fun when you make mistakes. Excelent if you plan on playing it with friends.
1;Really didn't think I'd like this game at all I'm not much of a competitive player and It took my friend months to convince me to actually buy the game and I don't regret It.The game Is fast paced and at times Intense and nerve racking when you're In overtime some people you meet will be toxic and have egos bigger than USA's debt but other than that this Is really a fun game to play with friends and a solid yes If you like competitive playing.
1;Cool game fun you can play with friends or family. Show them a replay and they will understand whats going on.I will never get bored of this game. It's really fun but it takes some time to learn the moves if you want to play ranked well but that happens in a lot of games.
1;Like Soccer? Hockey? Cars? Pay attention Beneath the initial mask of silliness Rocket League puts off lies a insanly fun competitive game.I often am turned away from the competitive/multiplayer scene but Psyonix has made something worth putting up with. If you can get by the sometimes toxic half of people you can really enjoy the game. Perfect for playing with friends and if you have the heart for it pretty great solo as well.This is the most fun competitive game I've played in years.
1;I love this game. The fact that it is almost limitless and that there is no skill ceiling makes this game awesome. There is a very good reason that this is a top seller. 200 hours in and still going strong. But be careful scams are abundant. Items can be gone in the blink of an eye. Never give out your account info! If you play this game smart you'll never let it sit unplayed in your library.
1;I need to say that this game in one of the best online games so far.It's not important that you need to love or understand the rules of football just do everything to score or help your teammates get a goal.it's very exciting and I need to admit that I can't stop playing this game.PS. so so with the offline game with AI
1;Rocket League is a game where you can Score awesome goals Help your friends score awesome goals Help the enemy team score awesome goals Score awesome double backlip bycicle goals Make awesome saves like you're the vehicular incarnation of Gigi Buffon Pimp your ride like Xzibit Test your skills4/20 dankest game there is
1;"""My controller was working last night and now it's not. There's no setting to """"force"""" a controller as the input method from within the game. Appears the game is reading as if there is a controller live but player 1 is a """"ghost."""" So my controller is syncing in as """"playing 2"""" now but I can't do anything."""
1;This is a great game. I have had it for a while now and definately recommend it. I also recommend that the next crate includes wheels called serpentine which is a snake coiled up and when its spinning it looks like a vortex. Again i love this game and definately recommend it!
1;This is one of those games that you fire up at the beginning of your day off and play until you realize it's only 8 hours until you need to go to work so you go to bed hungry and exhausted but can't get any rest because your brain's still envisioning the game calculating how to intercept a ball make shots on the goal or boost in the air for a save.
1;Rocket League is an example of a game done right. The devs are constantly in contact with the community about bugs and things that need fixing and have released loads of free content in the form of gamemodes cosmetics and other various things alongside the DLC that in my opinion is usually totally worth it. This game is one of my favorites and will continue to be for quite some time.
1;it's like Revolt mixed with a football in a cage and I love it! it's very addicting you'll like it even if you're not so into football like myself!takes some time to get used to it and actually make some goals. it's mad fun to get a full turbo boost and rush into the ball and even score a point like this you can be a goalie you can be a striker or you can simply be both by guarding the goal and rush out if you feel like there is an oppurtunity to score!
1;Its a great game cause its very fun to play with friends you dont get bored of it very easy.Overall its the game i have been playing for 2 years and it is always changing to the better!P.S The real fun in the game starts when you begin to get really good at it!
1;If your looking for a game which you can play when your bored out of your mind then this is it i was in the exact same situations as you bored lots of games but never felt like playing any of them well this just appealed to me and it still does now i can go on it when im bored and play it for hours. ive got to give it a 9/10.
1;Toxicity in the community is still a pretty large issue but it's no worse than any other game community and you can easily mute opponents/teammates at will. This game has tons of replayability and with the exception of the loot crate system I think this game is a must have for any steam library.
1;"""If you enjoy sports cars sports cars and EXPLOSIONS!!! then this is the game for you. I use to play it almost daily and its still just as enjoyable after months of playing. This is definatly one of those """"easy to learn hard to master"""" kind of games though. 8/8 would 8 again."""
1;I realised I hadn't given this game a positive review. The first time I ever saw anything related to Rocket League (or SARPBC) was watching a Kronovi montage on Youtube with my sister days after the game came out. It was sick. Bought the game and I sucked got a little better and now I'm mediocre. 10/10 only took three years to start landing aerial goals.
1;THIS. GAME. IS. THE. BEST! Although I have had a few problems with it overall its a game that many gamers would be glad to buy. This game is like well. Its not hard its fun its short matches for those of you with little time and its just great! I will give this game 9 out of 10 stars! Worth it!
1;make this game better and add a wide veriety of server gamemodes like unlimited boost and ball physics modifications instead of this ing power up t cmon really get your head out of you asses . and add these different gamemode to competitive play. EXPANDING THIS GAME SHOULD BE EASY CMON GUYS.
1;"""The game works it looks pretty it sounds pretty and I'm assuming at least one or two of the people who play it are pretty. If you have even one competitive bone in your body chances are you will enjoy this game.Your caffeinated beverage intake may increase however because this is very much so one of those """"Just one more match I promise"""" types of games."""
1;This game is great fun with friends and well worth the cash if you have a group of friends with it. It has a habbit of dropping you in to matches that are close to finishing with massive goal differences when playing online as a solo player however. So far 9 conscutive examples of this and often the same ******* match!Recommended but not for online play by yourself.
1;This game is simply rediculously crazy and fun and easily one of the best games to play with friends. The playlists are updated often and the ranked playlists have decent matchmaking as well but my personal favorite is to play 2v2 or 3v3 with friends as it is just a blast blowing each other up and scoring crazy goals on each other. Completely worth $20 and often on sale for $13.
1;Hate soccer Hate Car (games) Love this game. Honestly if you are looking for a game to play many hours on or just a 5 minute game you can and will. It is very addicting. The best way I can describe it is a competetive arcade game. The physics are astonishing. I am still getting the hang of it. Once you score that first goal (especially in overtime) you will fall in love.
1;This game is terrible. I've spent 2000 hours playing between PC and Xbox. It's terrible. Terrible because you'll stop talking to your family quit your job and end up spending any and all time not sleeping playing this terrible game. You'll hate yourself if you start playing. Do not play this game. OK I need to queue up. I've been away from the field far too long writing this review. I better get a good teammate.
1;What makes rocket league a good game.Gameplay pretty straight foward. Control are intuitive. You are a new player ? It is easy to jump in and have fun ( casual ) you have a car you bump the ball and try to score. But as time goes by the simple and straight foward gameplay hide quite some layers of complexity. Making the game both casual and really competitive. Legit 10/10
1;This game is just as good as bad its matchmaking system is... And trust me its matchmaking is absolutely terrible. I'd rather sing polka all day long than watching masters and legends coming in as my opponents while only a rookie joins my team. Polka polka polka Rocket League and polka!Polka polka polka Matchmaking and polka!Polka polka polka Rocket League and polka!Matchmaking is terrible and no rhymes came to my mind sorry.Polka polka polka...
1;Enjoy the game but it will make you put it down at the end of the day feeling more and vinegar than enjoyment due to high skill ceiling and people placing the blame on anyone they can. Spams are in your future and rants are likely to follow but a great game.
1;Really Nice Game.Maybe the matchmaking and toxicity in the game is a bit bad but overall its fine.btw you sould go into the Negitive reviews love to read about all the kids crying about learning curves and poeple being toxic and matchmaking D.10% would reccomend.
1;Ease of use x impossible to playx ok i guess.x easy to play/ really easy to playAesthetics x teriiblex tollerablex good/ almost as good as my profile )Audio design x pixelatedx okx great!/ music to my ears smug Organisation x super messyx somewhat organisedx organised/ amazingly organised!Originality x everything copied!x some ideas stolen/ originalx completely new!Overall Good! 8/10 Souls
1;The concept is slightly dumb but the game is amazing and the gamemodes are okay. I would recommend buying it in a summer sale or black friday sale as the original price is too expencive for the game itself. One thing I didn't like was the lack of rule 34 illustrations but that's not the game's fault. 8/10.
1;10/10 For Rocket LeaguePros Bad physicsDynamic &amp exciting gameplayLong term playability/Replay ValueBeautiful Visuals &amp great optimization for most decent PCsFun chat systemGreat control system especially with Dual Shock 4Great 2 player split screenAwesome community of playersGreat ranking systemCons More maps please Continue to improve servers(they have improved muchley)
1;Initially got this game for free on PSN and bought it on here to play with friends so I knew exactly what i was getting for 14.99.I love this game and originally I didn't think there was enough content to justify the 14.99 price tag but I can already tell I'm going to get my moneys worth and its DEFINITELY better playing with friends. (Even on a high ish difficulty bots on your team can be extremely moronic by potting balls into your own goal so avoid like the plague.)
1;Rocket League is a fun and exciting game and is definitly more enjoyable with friends. only bad thing is that they dont realease more free stuff to unlock much. so you can unlock everything really quickly which sucks as it is fun unlocking more and more stuff as you go. And you cant play cross platform in a private match aswell (Which Sucks) definitly worth the money 8/10
1;PROS This game is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Fast match ques and still a fairly healthy community years after release. lots of unlocks In game purchases are purely cosmetic. Most important. Great Value for $19.99 40+ hours of personally enjoyed gameplayCONS 10% of matches suffer heavy latency issues Bring friends or get punished Needs more updates/content to keep me playing
1;"""This game is extremely fun! Easy to learn hard to master. Games are relatively short but are extremely fun so you can play one to kill a little time or play a lot to climb the ranks. They are constantly adding new add ons to decorate your car to express your personality and new car designs can be purchased as dlc pretty inexpensively. If you are looking for an """"off the wall"""" sports game that is fast paced exciting and fun this is your game."""
1;The game is fun but seriosly you need to fix up the match making. I played 20 games and won 4 because i was teamed up with people who have bad ping or are afk or a rookie class. its a let down of the game. Not to mention the also along process where i couldnt find a game because there wasnt enough players.
1;This game is amazing!!!The controls are a bit wobbly bot other than than i am very pleased by it it is so fun to play even if your complete rubbish like me!And dont even get me started about when you score a goal it feels SOOOOOOOO good.Over all a true 10/10
1;Okay I see improvemnt as I don't join so often in already existing matches so I guess 'search engine' was improved.Game is good without any bugs or unexpected frame drops or crashes.Sometimes community is bit toxic but I recommend to turn of non team chat or even disable it.If you have some money and looking some fun this is what you are looking for.
1;Rocket League is a very fun game to me it has made me quite mad though when people win. Please make a gamemode where you can be on a team max 4 people and try to score in other goal ( usually) then you would have to get to a certain amount of points to win the game and you can vote on that and how much time you have and you can vote on points. I highly recommend this game for begginers at games but mostly for EVERYONE.
1;Seriously you're checking out reviews for this game to see whether or not you want to buy it? Have you not heard of this game or seen the huge positive response it's gotten since it's come out? Why are you still reading this? Buy this game it's as awesome as everyone says you won't regret it!
1;A Great Mix Of 2 Sports In A Single Sport . Mixing Football And Racing . You Can Have Amazing Cars With Amazing Customizations . It Is Also A Competitve Game With Many Ranks That Require A Lot Of Skills . Also Plug in A Controller If U Have One It'll Give U Better Control . Have A Good Day )
1;This game has gotten a lot of hate because of the bad servers on launch. The devs had no idea the game would skyrocket like it did they also have gotten more servers for everyone. The game runs smooth plays nice and the dlc's are only cosmetic. Great game!
1;I thoroughly enjoy this game. I've been waiting for ages to play it after enjoying SARPBC so much and I can see this game has come along way. The gameplay is simple yet addictive games can get real tense and theres a nice selection of game modes and customisation for your battle cars.
1;This game's a lot of fun. I'm not really into playing soccer games. I do like race car games. I usually don't like multiplayer but it's so easy to get into. I enjoy the singleplayer but I like the different levels of skill you can get in multiplayer. I also like seeing my improvement. I usually have stats at the end of a match now. And I rarely score in the wrong goal anymore.
1;Really a great game all around. It's exactly what it looks like in video's ninja flippin car's trying to score like a weird soccer game. It's a lot of fun to play casual or tournament. Recommend to anyone that likes to play games in general. A lot of cars to choose from and a good bit of customization as far as looks go. If you know someone that has it go play it at their house if your hesitant. But I don't think you can go wrong picking it up. See you in game.
1;So many people dislike futbol due to the slow pace it can have throughout a match. This game turns the sport upside down with amazing speed and customizable content. I can not wait until they release more content and even maybe more in depth competitive game mode servers. As a futbol fan and a car fan I will have to give this game a solid 11/10.
1;To be honest it's a fun game if you have a good internet connection you can play with your friends or just have fun messing around.Also as a little thing (not that it matters) I googled how to decrease your ping and limit bandwith amd you know what people kept saying? That their sisters kept downloading things. I didn't find one problem where their brother or any other person did the same D
1;This is a game for everyone. I highly recommend getting this if you like any game that requires personal play style and skill. While its very easy to pick up and play.. mastering rocket league is what gives this game staying power. I play at least once everyday and everyday I find a new way to burst throttle my boost in mid air to allocate the front of my car just right for a 70 ft high goal in mid air. This is simply just a great game.
1;the AI T in this game is completely unbearable and it ruins the season and exhibition modes to no end. There is actually little enjoyment in the season mode for me. However the online features as well as the customization make for a completely great complement to what I guess is this games pass as singleplayer.
1;A game about Battle cars that can go up walls go on the ceiling jump do flips tricks hit a ball into a goal and BLOW UP OTHER CARS. It's the ultimate mix of football and cars.What more do you want? Very fun to play with friends and have a laugh. WARNING! half TOXIC.(Psyonix can you add new gamemode pls )) D )
1;This is the most addicting game I have played and a must buy. I sit down to play a five minute match and end up wanting to play just one more match. I like the new point system and that you are rewarded for joining a game already in progress and don't earn for quitting early.Pro I just realized that I only paid $0.05/hr to play this game.Con I just realized that if I had worked overtime for the same hours I would had enough cash to buy a new vehicle.
1;Game is good that is all.Pros fun competitive extremely high skill ceiling (as high as everyones crushed dreams) Usually nice community Nice progression SystemCons The game can get fustrating (OPINION) apart from dropshot the alternative gamemodes are boring and underwhelming
1;"""""""How was your last game?"""" """"Good i scored 2 goals!"""" """"How did it end?"""" """"1 1..."""" No rly. RL is easily my most time consuming addiction ever. (not counting WoT and GW1 ages ago...) Yet it doesn't get boring in the slightest. And i guess i will never get sick of it... (my poor lifetime T T )"""
1;Very good game. Enjoy the concept and the design of the game. A big plus for the fact that is not pay to win. Only cosmetic items can be obtained in the game that dont affect the car at all. For new players it might be hard to get started but once you are in the flow it is an amazing game that can be played for multiple hours a day.
1;The gameplay of Rocket League is unique and in itself an amazing experience. But the amount of technical issues is appauling. Despite having a very low ping I still get lag spikes and disconnect warnings. I have not been able to find any fix to this even playing on different servers. I would suggest you buy the game but don't expect to not lag.
1;"""Two words Just.Amazing.It is very addicting and fun.Don't hesitate to get it!I have 250 hours on it been playing it non stop and still find it really fun.Plus the developers Psyonix always push out new dlc.And after almost 2000 matches in the end of each one of them I say to myself """"c'mon you have time for one more match""""."""
1;One of the best game of the 20th century. Go ahead if you are still not sure. But I highly recommend you to play with a controller (Xbox or DS4). Becareful of the community it's one of the most toxic I've seen so play with friends and you'll have lot of funs.
1;"""TBH here Rocket League is a great game. It could be better if servers and the matchmaking system were a little better... I mean you have cars a ball and real physics all you need is patience and a lot of time to get really good at the game. I saw on twitch a guy that said """"EASY TO PICK IT UP HARD TO MASTER"""" 100% accurate. Many players get mad at Rocket League but you know we love it so i recommend this game not 100% but maybe 95%.8.5/10 mmh i dont really know."""
1;Absolutely recommended even if you're not a football/soccer or just sports in general fan this game in multiplayer is just endless stupid fun ) A brillant gameplay that achieves to be very accessible while offering a great challenge to master the various required skills.
1;Few hours spent now and I can honestly say if you are looking for a game to take up an hour of your time then rocket league is for you.If you are looking for a game that will suck you in and alianate yourself from civilisation then Rocket league is for you.Buyers beware.
1;"""I have a boll I have car.I get Rocket League.This game is cool!Plus gameplay good optimization the lack of a regime BATTLE ROYALEMinus returd teammeats """"good"""" russia community usually very high ping 50&lt my ping &lt 100(I have internet with speed 65 mbit/s) cases batmobile main"""
1;honestly the best game i have ever played. got this for xbox and pc sank over 1000 hours into xbox its so addicting easy to pick up hard to master trading on this is like another game in itself love the game wish it had more modes/free event giveaways and decryptor items was tradeable after a while but all in all i would definately recommend this game to anyone! 10/10 from me!
1;Very good game Firstly you think football &amp cars meh... but it really plays well.Pros Good Style Music is great Graphics decent Its good funCons Offline the game is boring DLC ( 1.79 for an in game car is too much) AIImprovements Make a Career Mode Sort Out AI Make some of the DLC FREE!!! Add more custom stuffOverall Rating 8/10
1;"""I've probably never been this into a game except Minecraft and Halo for a very long time!!! One of my all time favorite games ever!!! The $20 I """"USED"""" on this game is DEFINITELY WORTH IT and I'm planning on getting all future DLCs because of my love for this game!"""
1;Heaps of fun and occasionally frustrating up to 4v4 soccer with rocket cars. Overall it's a great game to either pick up and play as a casual or delve deep into the competitive arena. This game will be around for a long time to come. The DLC purchases are purely cosmetic and have no impact on the playability of the game. Highly recommended.
1;Even after 1000 hours I still love this game. It is easily my most played game. You will always make mistakes and its always funny making mistakes with friends. Its totally playable with keyboard and mouse but I switched to controller after 250 hours of game time. GLHF
1;One of the greatest games I have played in a while. Simple but well executed it is a great balance of fun and challenge! it combines great gameplay with great graphics and for much cheaper than your AAA sports game alternatives it is a game that must be picked up D
1;No idea why my hours are so low it was showing 500+ oh well.My life is over.I spent all my time playing this game.It taunts me in my sleep to play.I enter and win 11/1 and get called a noob I tell him his life isnt worth living.He cries.I would abuse ps4 victims again11/10
1;This game has provided me with endless fun with limitless possibilities of moves that can be used in montage videos. This game relies mostly on skill and there is a long ladder to climb. However the game has loot boxes that require keys that you need to buy to open them and get cosmetics. Also the servers sucks and playing on them is like experiencing the world of quantum physics. The cars and the ball are not where they appear to be. I am not buying a single key until the servers are fixed.
1;The game is super fun and super addictive has a great non toxic community and frequent updates that add more and more stuff to the game which makes it even more enjoyable. Even if you don't enjoy regular soccer you still have other game modes such as hoops (basically basketball) hockey dropshot rumble rocket labs etc. Worth every penny. 10/10
1;This game is fantastic. I received the Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars for free on the playstation network years ago. I thought it was a neat game and then i had gotten my friends involved and we have had nothing but good times. Easy to pick up easy to have fun. Just like your mom.
1;This is one of the best multiplayer games i've played in a long time. Dont let the football/scoccer theme fool you I personally hate games like FIFA.It does take a bit of getting used to the controls. Also there doesnt seem to be any matchmaking system in the multiplayer games so you can come up against some pros but stick it out.Get this game you wont regret it!
1;Amazing game simple to pick up and annoyingly hard to master every match (even when matchmaking is meh) is still fun. Soild atention to details great customization options and overall a blast to play over and over. 10/10 will be playing for a long time
1;this game is amazing i love it been here before crates and it was still amazing but i wish you could grind the game for keys instead of always buying them and an option to buy crates 50 crates for 10 or $13 i love it community is good sometimes i have so many trade offers for my stuff i hope the rl creators do add a option to grind keys 8/10
1;This game is amazing hands down. I never realized how much I needed to drive supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars until I got this game. If you are on the fence about the game just get it. It is worth every cent of the mere $20 that is costs off sale.
1;When I first heard about Rocket League I thought that it wasn't really the game for me but after trying it I just can't seem to get my hands off it again. Even though the game sometimes bugs out for me it is still quite an enjoyment to play and there are many different modes to explore. The competitive aspect of Rocket League is also quite fun however I do believe that there could be some changes to the games ranking system. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would probably give this a 9.
1;In my opinion this is the best game thats ever been made. Masterfully designed this game has a perfectly fulfilling learning curve and a high skill cap. The physics are tweaked to make the pace of the game match your skill level. Loads of fun I can go on for hours... Get this game...
1;"""Great game with a very high skill cap and basically infinite playability. Hassle free fast matchmaking and an ever growing player base. Like any online game it has toxic players but you can filter chat to team only if you wish. Very addictive you will find yourself saying """"One more game..."""". Why haven't you bought this yet?"""
1;At first this unassuming game isn't very much fun. You drive around randomly trying to hit the ball and you don't really know what you're doing. After the 25 hour mark however you realize how much nuance there is to this game and the skill ceiling is beyond anything you could dream of. Play rocket league. Hopefully Rocket League will go free to play soon.
1;Awesome game Haven't seen such a simple yet beautifully completed design in a while. Easy to start hard to master as it is with all great games.Basic functionality is great but I would like to see some more features regarding splitscreen play. Like second player statistics. 2nd player lvl up right? So why not see the progress as well?
1;There are so much things that could be better but arent becoming better.Matchmaking I am unranked playing 1v1 with a silver 3Like rlly?!Reports You cant report annoying people for griefing.Community is not rlly that funBut ofc this game is not only filled with negativityThe gameplay itself is pretty fun.The physics itself are pretty good.
1;95/100This game is amazing and highly addicting. Whats so great about it is that you can either play a quick 5 minute match or play on for hours and hours. Very well made game good community easy to make friends and one of my favorite games. The only downfall of this game is the servers. Not all of them are terrible but some are absolute
1;Trade ups. Gambling. NOT? YES YOU WILL PLAY IN THE LEAGUE OF THE FOOTBALL CARS (BATTLE ROYALE UPDATE COMING OUT SOON) AND YOU. AND OTHER (S). 'can' PLAY TOGETHER IS YOU'RE FRIEND BAD? NO? GOOD? VERY A LOT OF UPDATES TO GAME AND BALANCED VEHICELS I REALLY LIKE THE CRATES YOU WANT MYSTERY DECAL? YOU WONT GET? YOU WANT PAINTED WHEELS? BURNT SIENNA! YOU WANT FUN? ' you here's competetive' RL
1;Get addicted to this game and play for hundreds of hours on your Dads pc Dads PC breaks cri for months decide to buy a library pc for 60 bucks play rocket league at 15 fps for many days library pc breaks cri for many more months decide to save for a real gaming laptop save for 5 months buy laptop be so stupidly happy it hurts
1;This game even though simple is amazingly fun. A real gem for its price range and I fully recommend it.*Super amount of props to the Devs at Rocket League for recognizing a complaint among its users and immediately fixing it. From now on there is a punishment for those who quit a match when losing. I'm glad to support this game. In fact it makes me want to throw more money at you.
1;The Ranking needs so much work!!!Win like 8 in a row and stay at rank 500 makes it uninteresting to play if you cant rank up.Needs more of a car selection Its an okay game if you have people to play with im sure once they fix the ranking system and work on the server situation the game will be more fun to play.
1;Great fun easy to learn hard to master gets the pulse pounding when you tie it up with 5 seconds on the clock. GREAT GAME.It could do with more cosmetic things because I unlocked all items after only 15 hours of play but Im sure the Devs will add more as time goes on.Highly recomended
1;Product received for free. When I first downloaded rocket league I thought it was just going to be some dumb racing game bc my friend gifted to me but I played it once and I was hooked great game but the jump mechanic where you can only double jump 1.5 seconds after the first jump or unless you're boosting the whole time is annoying but otherwise it's an amazing game and I would recommend it to anyone
1;If you don't have it get it. My impressions of this game and its developer are extremely positive. I can't think of any complaints aside from occasional crashes which seem to have more to do with my hardware than the game itself.This game is fun. The free content add ons are always great. I recommend it to anyone of any age casual and hardcore alike sport fans and non fans alike. Fun.
1;"""Rocket League is a very fun and enjoyable game even if it is somewhat lacking in variety. Much more exciting than """"normal"""" football and a lot more tense. Controls are easy to learn but hard to master allowing more skilled players to shine above others. Matches are short and can seem quite hectic but a team with proper tactics will still be in a better position to win than a team that doesn't work together. Could easily see this becoming a proper eSports game somewhere along the line."""
1;It looks like a stupid concept at first glance. The idea of using a rc car to play soccer with initially seemed stupid to me but after being advised by several friends to buy this game I did and I have throughly enjoyed it since. Great deal for 20 bucks.
1;The first 10 hours of this game will have you laughing your ing off like nothing ever has. Instant joy regardless of your performance the conceptual elements of the game just override everything and relentlessly strum your brain's pleasure centre like a ing guitar at a gypsy wedding.
1;This is my favorite game of all time. The game is easy to pick up and play but the skill ceiling is pretty much infinite. There are still mechanics being discovered nearly 3 years after the games release. There is no other game like Rocket League. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
1;The premise is that of a tacked on minigame from a kart racer but they went so much further. Cars that jump and almost fly performing bicycle kicks to score off of a header deflection? What's not to find spectacular about that?I'm enjoying it so far. It's the best part about buying the Steam controller.
1;This game is absolutely brilliant. It looks amazing the controls are beautiful the game is fun. It has one of those aspects where it's easy to learn and difficult to master. You can even fly your car around if you practice. just everything about this game is 10/10
1;Fantastic game that brings me back to my 90's/early 2000's with blitz and mario kart tournaments. This game is an absolute blast I questioned for days if it can REALLY be that fun of a game. It is stop thinking about it and buy it. Play it and get in on this game before everyone else is a thousand times better than you. BUUUUT that wont matter that much because no one has better vehicles or equipment were all on the same playing field!!!
1;matchmaking is pretty unfair if you live in a region with low player base (middle east) i'd rather wait 10 minutes or so than getting matched against champs while being D2 not to mention its ing plagued with smurfs climbing up the ranks is pretty much RNG out here.Edit I was pretty salty at the time of writing this If you couldn't tell. This game is definitely a steal for the amount of hours of fun i had
1;Not very different from normal life you know. Drivin around in a rocket powered Car shooting gianourmous balls into goals and getting flung around by the shockwave after. Wait. just me??? Well then...Anyway... strongly recommend a controller (xbox wired) but alltogether? Great game
1;Excellent game to play with friends and I don't even like football.+ Easy to pick up difficult to master it's harder than it looks+ Great drop in multiplayer system+ Supports both online (up to 8 players 4v4) and local multiplayer (up to 4 players) you can even bring your local co op friends online against other players+ Supports cross platform multiplayer+ Lots of unlockables+ Great soundtrack Doesn't handle network lag very well the slightest jitter will cause you to rubberband
1;To be frank I'm not the biggest fan of football but Rocket League made quite an impression on me (admittedly Rocket League is not your regular football game). If you're like me and you don't find the FIFA and PES franchises particularly interesting give this title a go. Maybe you'll enjoy it. I certainly did it's so stirring for me!
1;"""very fun well thought out game. Distinct lack of """"upgrades"""" as all the variable parts of your car are cosmetic which is fair but they could have made it so that each upgrade impacted other aspects negatively so each car was still equal just in variable areas of its capability. DLC became available a lot sooner than I would have liked but the devs also released a free map to the original users so they havent forgotten where their values are in the people who paid to fund their next releases."""
1;If you don't like soccer and you don't like racing/cars you'll still like Rocket League. I cannot think of a reason why someone wouldn't love this game. The graphics are great the processing is fantastic the multiplayer and player options are fantastic a truly wonderful game. Top 3 favorite games ever!
1;I honestl couldnt recommend this game higher. Its fantastic control system and fun gameplay combined create a fun long lasting game. Logging over 100 hours on console and 50 so far on PC there is no chance of me stopping enjoying this game. The only negative to this game is that there isnt steam inventory trading. The items achieved within the game cannot be traded through steam which is a bit annoying however it isnt too much of a worry to me.
1;This would be a great game if i was able to log onto the rocket league servers somehow to play online and not continuously verse bots. Funny how my mate next to me could join online games and im sitting here suffering!!!!!!!!!!! AAAARRRRGGGGHJHHHJJJJHJHJHKJ CLXgd fijbsoiuvbzs ob
1;Great game have spent a stupid number of hours on it in the short time I've had it.However when Esports stuff is broadcasting I get lag spikes making it unplayable (this happens at no other time with no one else home and my speed tests are fine ruled them all out)I just wait for that to be over and resume playing. Would love to see some options for some of the DLC cars however. can't change much if anything on some which is a let down.
1;"""Nice one!Nice one!Nice one!""""Chat Dissabled for 4 Seconds...""""First of all let me say that if you decide to play this game... I guarantee you get addicted I've been playing this game for about a year now and I don't see myself loosing intrest anytime soon. This is my favorite game as of now and has been for about a year... I would reccomend this game to almost ANYONE!!It's TOATTLY worth the $20... Believe me!"""
1;Product received for free. I've been playing Rocket League since beta on PS4 after a couple hundred hours on PS4 and later switching to PC I still keep coming back to it. Pros Easy to pick up but difficult to master New content regularly Split screen multiplayerCons Community can be toxic sometimes. I guess that can be expected with most online multiplayer games though.
1;This game is alot of fun! Super competitive. It takes a while to feel like you are getting better at the game. Which is good shows progression and 5 minute games turns into 200+ hours or more. Depending how much you enjoy it or how much time you play.
1;Honestly this game has made me so mad. I have not played this game for a day and not raged. It is NOT Pysonix' fault kind of. If you win 10 game in a row in competitive you get punished by going against people 2 whole ranks above you. That is the only bad thing about this game. This game is also so much fun every game is new and the community is the strongest I have seen. They keep pushing updates out and improve servers more than expected. Overral this game is a must buy.
1;I have friends that say they've played fifteen minutes of this game and have had enough of it...and theyre idiots. This game incredible. Arcady but fun as hell. Easy to play hard as hell to master. Graphics 9/10 (just how youd want itGameplay 10/10 solid controlsStory Wtf why would you think theres a storyGame on and trade with me bois and grills
1;FUN AS FAK! Your car literally has a rocket strapped to its Only downside I've noticed is players out with a quickness (like no multiplayer game I've seen before) if you get 2 or 3 scores ahead instead of finishing a 5 minute game ... Master the art of rocket car flying to become king!
1;Soccer but on wheels! What more could you ask for. Fast action packed games where you will be screaming at your teammates wondering what the **** they are doing. This game may be difficult to get the hang of but they got you covered with multiple ways of training to make you feel comfortable with the play style of the game.
1;Outstanding game. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys the spirit of competition. Very simplistic concept featuring an extraordinarily high skill cap. A delightful concoction of 2 parts FIFA 1 part billiards 1 part racing and 1 part strategy makes for the best game of 2015 hands down.
1;Rocket league is a amazing game. This game may look simple but the deeper you get into this the more complex it will get. You will have to learn things like air hits dribbling and much more skills. This game is amazing. But be warned in the game their will be scammers so learn how to not get scammed.
1;Recommend this game to everybody who is interested in it.The developers are always updating the game and try to implement what the community requests.The graphics are fitting the performence is good the competitive scene is very incouraging to try your best.
1;God damn this game is fun. Get some friends to yell at or just shut up and play solo making you think you're the greatest aerial hitter there is until someone comes along and makes your mouth open in awe. Then watch the ESL VODs and realize you have a hella long way to go. In fact stop reading this review go play the game!
1;I would definately reccomond Rocket League to anyone I know. You dont have to be a soccer fan to like Rocket League either due to its fun gameplay and amazing graphics this coupled with the support Rocket League recieves is a great reason many people around the world play Rocket League and will continue to play it for years to come.
1;Please please build a feedback form into the match results screen. Some of these games are unbearablely laggy and I'm located in SF CA fairly close to your servers. Sometimes i have sub 10ms ping other times it goes into 300ms. Once you've completed a game you can't see which server you're on. It's incredibly frustrating losing games because you're teleporting halfway across the map.Growing pains. This is obviously a great game but the servers are not designed to handle the load they're under.
1;Very fun game but the competitive ranking system is a little messed up. My buddy and I did all of our placement matches together and we won all of them and I was the mvp in every game. In the end he gets ranked Gold 3 and I'm down at silver 2....how does this work?
1;Its like football (or basketball) but with cars! All this should come as no surprise if you've watched the trailer...The game has never been bugged for me and runs super smoothly and the dlc is cool but not necessary. Is it fun you ask? well obviously its fun _
1;Cool game Should I say more I don t think so Great and beautiful game engine cool customisations no need to buy a dlc for having fun you can play at one PC against your friends you can play with your friends you can play at one PC with your friends online vs others!!!! and there was only one time where the servers weren t working so... Cool game D
1;I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. This is a great game. Very addicting very fun and very challenging. From scoring your first awful random hilarious goal to ranking up the ladder and learning how high the skill ceiling is. Lots of love.
1;This is honestly one of the most fun games released in the past decade. Easy for anyone to pick up but has an incredibly high mastery ceiling and as silly as it sounds probably the closest simulation to playing a sport any video game has attempted so far.
1;A very good game. It is just cars with rocket boost and a big ball that two teams have to play soccer with. Simple but fun and a game you could come back to. There are 9 modes and a competitive(up to 3v3). These modes are dropshot rocket labs rumble ice hockey basketball 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. This game is even better if you play with friends. Though there is some times you want to rage quit when playing competitve. Overall I really like this game!
1;"""This game is incredibly hillarious when playing with friends made many quotes to this game than ever and the possibilities can never go out the goals you can make in this game is just off the charts snipes all around accidents and sometimes purposely off friends. """"You can't hit what you can't see"""" """"It was for the best"""""""
1;Product received for free. So refreshingly fun. This game offers endless amounts of fun and you never really get bored playing it. I got it for free with my GTX 1050 Ti and I decided to try it out and it's now my main game and one of my top 2 3 favorites!
1;Great Game just get it. This is the best sports game I have ever played. I bought it thinking it was going to be fun for maybe 10 hours. I am about 110 hours in now and show no sign of stopping. Great game to play with friends on a mic because you can pass the ball and such to set up shots.
1;Great game doesn't get old and always improved with free updates.Its a game that works great with friends together or that game you need to kill 20 minutes for instead of submitting yourself to a major story quest in an RPG or a 40 minute online FPS map.Would always recommended this game.
1;I would say that in overall rocket league has made some change since the begining and other great changes are coming in the next three months as well as further this year. I would totally recommand it. Also there is always news about recent and future update on the Rocket League website.
1;Bought this game when it came out Psyonix are an amazing company and have provided a unique competitive game that will leave you laughing raging crying and ultimately happy. Best competitive game I have ever played on PC and I would recommend it to all kinds of gamers!
1;Rocket League is a great game for competitive game play as well as playing with your friends. No matter the skill level you have you can always find yourself enjoying the game. Some players are a little toxic but don't let that discourage you you'll get there. Regardless this game is phenominal and I appreciate the game and the creators for this.
1;Rocket League is one of those games where you pull off one insane shot and feel on top of the world. Then proceed to score an own goal and get complimented by everyone with 'nice save'!In short if you want to live the high live and occasionally from crippling depression then get this game.
1;This game is so addictive and fun! I can play this game for a good 9 hours a day just because its so fun! 10 10 game! Would buy 11 more times!PS Servers are laggy af and i keep basically stuttering across the pitch and its really hard if not impossible to play please fix this i love this game (
1;"""Great game dont mind the negative crybabies talking about a toxic community... if someone is honestly able to comment over the internet about the way you play a game and it hurts """"feewings"""" then maybe you should reconsider playing online video games in general. The only issue is a little lag here and there. Other than that 9.5/10"""
1;To all of those who are considering buying this game I find it addicting and beyond fun.There are the hard times where you feel like throwing your PC out the window but it makes you stronger don't give up you will find it very rewarding. Though I can say the matchmaking at times can be a little messed up so is every game P I have over 200 hours showing how addicted I am.Overall Rocket league is a one of a kind Brilliant game
1;A review for this game...Where to start..I can sum it up If you play this game and you do not get a smile on your face there is something wrong with you!! Have yourself checked and fix it. Comeback and guarenteed you will smile eventually!! But in all seriousness this game is just epic. Fast paced you can play it for 10minutes or 3 hours. It gets better and better. There is actually a learning curve as well. It has everything you could wish for in a game. imho.
1;This game is the rocket powered car soccer equivalent of dark souls. It will gift you the highest highs when the risks are converted to reward. When risks show their darker side however and the numerous failed attempts at what almost could've been results in your utter decapsulization of everything you are as a human being... then you will come to truly know.. and in some ways love respect and admire.. yet fear and loathe the game that is Rocket League. 10/10
1;I like this game but I need to get some things off my chest.I ! #$ING HATE HOW EVERY TEAM I JOIN JUST TURNS !There Been able to get up to bronze III once mostly playing with mates I decide to queue solo either teammates are rookies or a ping of over 200 Also love that I get into games with 3 expert players as enemy....This game is great but it's matchmaking is a kick in the D.
1;One of the best relaxing and competitive co operative game i've played. Many rewards are given just by playing the dlc are very cheap as well and obtainable just by selling steam trading cards. One of the best and cheap pick up game. I recommended it alot.
1;Rocket league has proven to be one of my favorite games to play by myself as well as with all of my friends. I am not the greatest at the game but I always have fun with it. This game has really brought out the competitive side in me with ranked games and all I can say is it is completely worth purchasing. also... Totally recommend a ps4 or xbone controller over kb/mouse any and every day.
1;This game has constantly held my attention for about 3 months now and I havn't lost intrest. A lot of people say it's not fun because its the same thing every time you play but its not it's about strategy and anticipation. This game is well worth your time not only for the amazing graphics but the excitement you get for every goal you score.
1;I think it's pretty telling when a very large portion of the players who have reviewed this game have over several hundred hours in the game. The game doesn't look like much but it's strangely addicting. Before you know it you've got almost 500 hours in the game.
1;Very fun to play the gameplay does get vary repetitive but with the extra additions that they will be adding and leauge play it will make this game what it should be. This game has sooo manythings to unlock so theres always a grind aswell as the grind for higher ranks. &lt 3 Nick
1;I would donate my right testicle to be able to ensure I can play this game for the rest of my life. The community honestly isn't as aids as people say and there's never a dull moment. The only criticism I'd have is maybe generate more interest in the non standard maps/playlists or make them more accessible. I loved the old Neo Tokyo in ranked.
1;I don't review games often but I feel like this game deserves it.I haven't had this much fun playing a sports style game since the days of the N64. Going into my purchase I thought $20 was a bit steep and while I still think 20 dollars is a bit much for a sports game I'm glad I bought this one. I've been watching JackSepticeye and Markiplier play it on youtube and its as fun as it looks. So far the community has been friendly. I highly recommend the tutorial and the practice arenas.
1;There is no purpouse to this game. You're a car playing soccer with other cars where you have to make a giant ball get in the opponents goal and prevent them from doing the same.That's 25 hours I'm never getting back.That's 25 hours I don't really want back.
1;One of the best fantasy sports games out there. Fast gameplay and excellent physics all around and even plays on lower end hardware. It's cheap to boot. The recent addition of Hocky only serves to make the game even more fast and furious (it had better stay). The only real downside is a bit of a lack of fields and game modes. Still it is totally worth the $20.
1;Fun crazy addicting game. Play with friends online or by yourself. Huge community. A nearly limitless skill ceiling. Easy to learn Hard to master. Fun for spectators fun for players. Casual fun gameplay Professional fun gameplay. Splitscreen. And many more!Witness the game that is the future of eSports
1;"""Oh god I never actually played any """"sports"""" game before.When many of my Steam Friends told me that it was a huge blast I said """"F*ck it I can refund it if I don't like it"""".Oh man this game changed my life. Yes it's a competitive game but a funny one!The reward you get when making those long range pass or goals is simply amazing!Communication is key boost too!""""What a save!"""""""
1;This game is great fun takes some time to get the hang of it and mastering it even longer. But its a game you can play when you only have 10 mins to spare and it excels when you playing on a team with your mates.I find the random matchfinding annoying since its hard to find a random who will play with teamwork but thats hardly the games fault.
1;This is probably one of the best multiplayer games out there right now. The game is extremely hard in the beginning and even hitting the ball is a challenge. Like any other game no matter how good you are you'll get your kicked sometimes but that's what makes rocket league so good. The skill ceiling is insanely high so the control you have over the outcome of the game is huge. Just practice and you will get better.... probably.
1;Why isn't this game Free To Play? It's literally made to be open and free with limitless options for devs to earn money. More players on servers would mean matchmaking heaven. Just give some gifts to players who already bought it and open this masterpiece to the world.
1;Cars rockets and soccerballs what is there not to love?The game runs on a plethora of setups and works quite well on multiplayer. There is sometimes a small amount of lag at the beginning of matches but this being a result of connection is negligible. The physics are fairly realistic (in as much as cars having rockets strapped to them can be realistic) but the game requires practice to become efficiently menacing in play.10.1/10
1;Simple and fun. If you like team sports with explosions and racing and uncomplicated physics this is a great game for you. (And for a game with only one map layout I've spent a surprising number of hours playing it!) The only downside is the aggressive amount of money they charge you to take a chance at getting car mods that look neat. Mods don't change gameplay though so it's completely avoidable.
1;The Fu**ing best multiplayer competitive game you will find these days no it has the gameplay the controls the ranking the mofo'in fun. For real you got to put some hours in this to gitgud... but it's worth it all after an aerial dribble dodge reset goal....
1;The dankest 5 min turbo car soccer matchs out there.What is good about the game Like a f*cking ton of free items. Cool graphics. Many maps game mods workshop etc.. Events new stuffs always in development.What is not so good about the game Sometimes servers become sh*t 4 real. Match matching is just crap.
1;Man this game is the true awesomeness! For real its a ton of fun doing crazy stuff with friends and scoring better and better goals! The strategy is maybe simple but the creativity is over 9000! Easy to learn hard to master. After (ik not that much) 174 played hours I can say that it never got boring to me. This game deserves to be a topseller!
1;FIX YOUR ING SERVERS. I CANT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES IVE LOST A GAME BECAUSE EITHER ME OR A TEAMMATE IS LAGGING OUR OFF AND ITS ALL OF YOUR SERVERS FAULT. ITS SO ING STUPID. STOP RELEASING CRATES AND OTHER STUPID CAR GARBAGE AND MAKE THE ACTUAL GAME PLAYABLE FIRST. FFS I LOVE THIS GAME BUT I AM GOING TO STOP PLAYING IT UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS FIXED AND I GUESS IF ITS NEVER FIXED THAN THIS GAME. DUMBASS DEVELOPMENT TEAM
1;Product received for free. good game. definitely have had a lot of good times and good memories on this. would recommend very much especially to play with friends. however after time its becoming a bit stale to me. car soccer can only get so exciting and new.
1;Rocket league is a fun multiplayer fast pase game. And completly follows its previos games title (SuperSonic Acrobatic Rocket Power Battle Cars) It is fun to play alone and with friends. The multiplayer is made well and joins you to servers with good speed. Also there are 1000's of ways to costumize your car as you likeIn the end i reccomend this game to everyone even those who do not like racing or soccer games.
1;Game is incredibly fun can be both competitive or just play for fun. Has fun gamemodes and a wide variety of cars cosmetics aswell as a trading system. 10/10 game I recommend to buy at full price if you dont want to wait for it to go on sale! Worth every penny D
1;Best game I ve ever played. A friend recommended it and I bought it no regret at all. Has some issues here and there like every game but overall definitely worth buying for any type of player. Casual is great mess around freestyle do whatever you want. Competitive is just as fun for me the skill gap is huge in this game so competitive is very challenging at higher ranks. 9.8/10 for me.
1;This game is the best game I have ever played on steam. When you start to get really good you get really into the game. It is super fun espessially that it had no violence (Evept for demolishing but that is not really anything). This is such a fun game and it can be super competitive. You can also play 1v1 with friends or have them on your team. If you have seen YouTube videos about this game and really want it I would get it easily.
1;"""Rocket League is my favorite game and will be for a long time. Overall the formatting is very good but I wish that you could have a solo Q option for doubles and standard so you aren't at such a disadvantage if you have two random teamates in standard playing against and """"organized"""" team."""
1;This game so much fun online. You never know how good a player you will both play against or have on your team. There are many highs and lows. You can feel very satified after your team works together at a goal or disapointed when your team mate scores a goal against your team. Lol! All in all it is a great safe game for the whole family.
1;This is a hilarious rage inducing game of skill.The community players and developers have cultivated is one of the most positive I've seen. Except those $#!&amp rage quitters. I'm hooked like a tweaked out rocket fiend unable to find a substitute. I have never spent so much of my life with one video game. I may need an intervention.I don't remember what my wife looks like and I dream of flying cars that $#!% rainbows.
1;One of the best games I have ever played I tend to get bored with other games if they aren't challenging enough but this keeps me on the edge of my chair every time I hit the ball just make sure you have good video card. If I could I would give this game two thumbs up!!
1;I actually F U_C.KING hate this game.All rage aside its a brilliant game but the matchmaking is fecked. Constantly matched up with dimwitted cvnts who cant play for sh t. I work my ar5e off to get promoted to better tiers and divisions to be paired up with these c&lt &gt ck gobbling monkey fockers.Also those crates can feck off too.
1;This is an amazing game with beautiful graphics to bad I can not play with the best graphics without there being lag. Just is a good game to just go on and play so far the DLCs are pretty cheap $3.99. Rocket League became my favorite game since i got it.
1;Who would have thought that hitting a ball with rocket cars would be such an incredible game taking up more time then I'd like to admit. Psyonix seems to be pretty active with the community as far as improvements which is a rarity it seems now a days. I really enjoy this game and the competitive aspect behind it. Excited to see what they come out with next.
1;Extremely fun not only for gameplay but the difference this game has to other games i have been on and off this game for the past year and i have really enjoyed the competitive scene and the trading and item scene of the game Its good that the DEVS have a variety for both sides of the gaming community and they can treat both sides with as much dedication.
1;This is the most fun I've had playing a game in years! I had gotten away from multiplayer but Rocket League has a great small team size that makes it feel like everyone contributes something. The fact that I can go from starting the game to in a match in 25 seconds doesn't hurt either!Can not recommend strongly enough buy this!
1;Great game cant say much more. Its kept interesting with regular events and various DLC. I never seem to have any connection issues when playing online and the matchmaking seems very fair. I also play this on Switch and PS4 but you cant beat playing on pc at higher FPS. Its a night and day difference in experience. Would fully recomend even if you already play on another device.
1;I Do play sport and I am a sports fan this game honeslty is one of my favorite games of 2015. If I'm having a s*it day at school I'll just get on my PC and play some great rocket league. Even if you don't enjoy sports this game is still amazing and fun for all ages10/10 IGN
1;This game is perfection. It's endless fun right from the moment you touch the ball for the first time to your 1 000th goal. The devs are amazing. The game is very reasonably priced. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about Rocket League. Buy it!
1;"""This game is a must have. If you haven't purchased this yet for all the hundreds of hours you will have playing it. Do it for all the passive aggressive """"What a saves"""" you'll get from friend and foe when you fail to stop the other team from scoring."""
1;What do you get when football meets rocket fueled cars? You get Rocket League. What do you get by that? You get tons of fun and fury with your friends from very simple game with bit of learning. Game mechanics are quite simple but require perfection gliding in air and doing 3D manouvers to hit the sweet spot goal. Game is equipped with Ranked Match Making option if you want to see how far you can get by playing competitive.
1;"""Your friend probably introduced you to this game and you though """"hey that looks easy"""". Well...it's not we all suck and we all love this game. Calling this game """"car soccer"""" is like calling poker a game of luck technically true but really missing the point."""
1;"""This is a game I keep going back to. I've also put in about 150 hours into this game on PS4 and a handful on the Switch. The best description I've heard about this game is that it's """"easy to learn but hard to master."""" The latter part of that description is what keeps me hooked. Learning new tricks and strategies take a simple gameplay formula and turns it into a game with seemingly unlimited replay potential."""
1;I think that Psyonix has done a great job making Rocket League a successful and favoured game by thousands of people! Hopefully you get this game and enjoy the quality or gameplay it has to offer and the community is a happy place for others! Good job Psyonix
1;What happens when you combine rockets cars soccer flying and skill? You get ROCKET LEAGUE!!!Rocket League is one of the very few games I have come across over my pass few years of gaming were I just keep coming back to it and playing more and more. It's a game that will have you at the edge of your seat wanting to score that tie breaker goal with some sweeeeeet arials. Rocket League is an amazing game and you don't have to be a pro to play it! Its easy to pick up and harder to get off!
1;I 100% urge you to buy this game! It is a really cool super fast action packed game if you're into sporty video games or sports in real life! For the past 1.5 years of me playing this game I have enjoyed 98% of my experience! I recommend this game to all you soccer and sport lovers out there! After the Free Weekend buy this amazing game!
1;First this game is so so so muchfunandaddictiveHard to master and get the hang of it but once the first few steps done You will enjoy the pleasant knowledge of flying to victory!Do no give up ! it does get super fun and you will surprise yourself! hehe.ow imagine they do a golf mod D ahah would be fun!Enjoy this beauty of a game hehe.
1;Rocket League is an awesome game with a great community. At first I was skeptical about buying this game but after it went on sale I felt like why not. I got the game for around $12 and one of the dlc's for $3. This game is definately worth $12 and had I known how good it was I probably wouldn't have waited for it to go on sale. Its great to play with friends and I would recommend it to anyone who likes racing games sports games or competitive games.
1;This is my first review ever! GET THIS GAME! I love the gameplay and played a couple hours before I knew it. Also there is a lot of customization to do to your car alone! Yes servers are having trouble atm but they know it and announced they are fixing them. They are just overloaded and did not expect such a mass trying to play all at once! Me and my friends can not wait to play together!
1;One of my favorite competitive multiplayer experiences. This game is somewhat difficult to start playing but after just a few games (5 minutes per match) I was addicted. Lots of stuff you can learn and you get some awesome items the more you play to make your car more unique.
1;This game was fun for 3 friends trying to get better... for about a monthThe game started adding too many cosmetics and the community turned to trash.Buy this game if you want to throw your keyboard/controller at your monitor because you can't hit a ceiling shot )
1;This games takes time to master even simple aerial can be nerve breaking to hit. But once you do master that technique u are good to go. You can play for hundreds of hours and never get bored of it. Graphics are amazing simple yet smooth minimal but impact heavy.Even your PC can be average you can still run it.Overall my score is 10/10 would recommend it to everyone whos looking for fun and time wasting game.
1;With Friend this is the best stoprt game for thoes who love sport games but with friend it also the best sport game for thoes who don t know how ball or puck looks like! In the end it s totally MUST BUY! so BUY IT stop reading this and go out and BUY IT!
1;People love driving games. People love football/soccer. People love boosters/jetpacks.Rocket League is all this. It's fast it requires skill there's no skill ceiling it's fun alone it's even more fun with friends skill &gt luck hitting the ball is satisfying games are short there are moments of spectacle there are moments of awesomeness there's teamwork competition customization...Basically it keeps you at the edge of your seat. Also Psyonix have been awesome at their job until now.
1;This game has gone above and beyond my expectations. The brand new maps are amazing especially the donut shaped map. It is both fun and addicitng and is always a good game to play whenever you are bored. My only thing is the hit boxes are definitely bigger than the car but overall awesome game!
1;Game is really solid other than the fact that you pay $20 and can still make in game purchases for more cars and other cosmetices. Lots of maps and 4 game modes with 5 variations of soccar to play. Community is hugely involved in trading but to me isnt worth the time or money. The community can become toxic but it'snot something that you want to come to know yourself or friends as. I give it a solid 9/10 with 1 because of crates and keys.
1;This is one of my favorite games to play. It's like a real sport I mean it's soccer with cars that run on rockets. It's got a good competitive mode and is an actual esport. the controls are great. This is one of those games that is easy to pick up and plan but hard to fully master.
1;okay i cant not recommend this game but devs the game crashed when i was in a ranked game it didnt let me rejoin the match and then it banned me for 4 minutes. WTF GUYS KICK ME WHILE IM DOWN??????? Anyways... was having a good game why you gotta ruin it bro?
1;As said in my video this is Top Gear's car football gone wild. Sure it's aggrevating but at the end of the day it's great fun when you realise that it's just a game and you become civil. Then you play duel and smash your keyboard/controller. Buy it. You won't stop playing it.
1;"""Honestly the best competitive game I have ever play the only thing that drags this game down is the community. One sec your partner is saying """"sorry sorry wont happen again"""" and then he is cursing you out in some hebrew language. Also dont buy this game if you're not going to attempt to get better at it it takes time dont just quit or not attempt to because """"its too hard theres no way ill ever be that good"""". Once you get good at the game it gets so much better."""
1;"""This game is a TON of fun. You can play for hours and it comes with a big """"one more game"""" feeling. One complaint the AI is straight up garbage at times.I'll be boosting in on a sweet shot that my teamates set up and the AI like an overzealous idiotic flying moron will blast from the side and knock the ball to the side of the map. Its frustrating as hell to spend time setting up the shot and be foiled by a ding dong.10/10 would reccomend definately a fun experience."""
1;Tilt sim 2k16. This is a game where it can either be completely team based or can me a single handed stomp. It takes a while to get used to the mechanics but once you've gotten them down you're not going to forget them. I definitely recommend playing with a premade team. Also keyboard and mouse master race.
1;Really fun game if you get into it. The learning curve is quite steep so it will take a little while to figure out the mechanics and when you do it will become a very competetive game. I also like how there are different modes and community made maps that are now available. 100 hours in the past 2 weeks cant be healthy ).
1;This game is unbelievably fun. It's great to play with friends but you can go solo as well. While it may take a few games and some training you will get the mechanics down quickly and it will make the game far more fun. Becoming a very good player is difficult however and I still consider myself to be pretty bad but the game is still enjoyable. Overall the game is great and you will waste a lot of time playing it if you decide to get it.
1;It's a great game definitely a must to buy. But its only problem is the servers Instability they keep crashing. The game recommends a Controller to play which I'll get to try soon ). The game is easy to play but hard to master It has a lot of gameplay mechanix like passing the ball to your teammate etc ... Great game to play and I'm sure you'll have fun especially if you play with friends ( well my freinds don't have the game) ... what are you waiting for ? Get It P
1;EDIT I changed this from negative to postive...here's why It's original with it's unique idea!It's nice to grind and learn new stuff.You can team up with a lot of people or trade !!I used to have connection issues and when i contacted them they were very responsive and helpful!!! and after i could play properly i knew how awesome it was.Thanks for reading and have a good day D
1;This game is always fun. The game's physics are spot on. The only thing that is poor about this game is the VOIP quality. Often times other cannot even be understood when he or she tries to talk. Besides that the game is wonderful. Easy to play yet difficult to master.
1;The REAL killer for me is that this game overrides ctrl+alt+delete. Its an a mazing game to play but when I want to switch playlists I have to exit completely out of the game. Once my volume was way too loud accidentally. There was literally nothing I could do about it. ctrl+alt+delete just brings you back to the game.
1;I've been a gamer for about 27 years since I was 5 years old and this is seriously one of the best games I've played and would definitely be in my all time top 10!Very balanced and as cliche as it sounds it's easy to learn but near impossible to master! Lots of fun playing though!
1;This game is so great! It is so addicting and amazing! I love playing it so much! I've had it for about 2 weeks and I'm already level 30! It's the greatest game that I've ever played! You can play it for 5 hours and never get bored. I love it so much!
1;Very fun game with nearly infinite replayability. One of my favorite non FPS online games right now. A nice thing about it is that it isn't terribly demanding and will run on many computers. Only real issue is that some of the achievements require all the DLC cars to unlock.
1;The most addicting casual game I have ever played. I've been obsessed with a lot of games sometimes for a month sometimes for a year but Rocket League is the only game i can see myself playing casually forever. Thats not to say you can't become obsessed with improving to the highest level and develop extremely technical skills but you can always play it casually.
1;I love this game with all my heart. Do i still suck after hundred of hours of gameplay? Absolutely. Do I enjoy dunking on noobs one momnet only to get shafted by a god tier player the next? Yessir. Rocket League has been one of my favorite games for almost two years now and I see no reason to stop playing any time soon. This game is definetly worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to try out a game different from anything else out there.
1;Out of all games this is the only game I have bought full price so Psyonix will improve this or make other games (granted i havent bought a lot of games). If you like cars soccer or tricks n get this game if you dont get it anyway because YOUR MISSING OUT.
1;I'd say I have my fair share of hours into this game and all I have to say is that it's fantastic. The game is wonderful on all levels whether just starting out or an experienced pro this game never was boring to me. The game has quite the learning curve and definitely a bigger one than I expected. The replayability of this game is great I always find myself coming back to it to refine my skills. A must have game.
1;One of the most fun games i've played in a long time at the beginning you think its such a simple but genius game then you realise there's a lot more to it than simplicity and it takes a long time to get good at this game . Still enjoying almost every minute tho
1;Rocket league is a great game to play to get away from violent games.Rocket league has many customizing selections such as cars decals paintjobs boosts wheels hats goal explosions.this makes the game fun for me as I love to customize my car. I am also a big fan of trading but I have only just began so my friend M4TH14$ helped me out with some items.great game
1;This game is great and fun for a couple of hours when you play it alone however with friends its much more fun and you can keep playing it all day.You can customize your car however you want with decals boosts (They look pretty ) paint and a lot of other things like tops and antenna's! )Its a really fun game but it just gets funnier when you're playing with friends!Gameplay 9/10Graphics 8.5/10 (The reason is too much light)
1;Especially with the current sale (Christmas sale is at the time I am writing this) this game is completely worth it and maybe you can make some money off of it by entering and winning tournaments! Absolutely amazing game that I would recommend to all my friends.
1;I really like Rocket League for the most part just don't play on Ranked. Ranked is awful and unbalanced to hell putting people who are really bad on one side with really good on the other in a way reminiscent of Quake and early Halo matchmaking.Overall if you want to just play this for fun or with the family then it's worth getting.Would love to see a split screen option in a future update possibly?
1;Rocket League is the most genius and addicting game I've probably ever played. I owned the first game SARP Battle Cars and as amazing as it was then it's about 100x better now. It's definitely worth the $20 and anyone who is looking for something fresh THIS IS A MUST BUY!
1;In all honesty i play this game at least once a day. I genuinly have fun in this game and haven't stopped since i first got it.I originally got it on the PS4 when it was on PS+ thinking it was a small game but it's properly gone and changed my life its so good honest.Now i recently obtained it on PC and well it's even better (i still recommend a controller).Get it have some fun with friends or go solo either way you'll have a great time!hit me up if you wanna play!!
1;"""A nice calming game that can be played while your waiting for something. Rocket League is a enjoying game that really created its own genre of gaming """"Vehicular Soccer"""". While simple on the surface it has a decently high skill ceiling with flying teamwork and avoiding the one idiot trying to explode you. Although I will admit the game is a bit pricy but its still a nice relaxing game. Unless your unboxing or in competitive."""
1;Very good game. Alot of fun all the time i play it alone or with friends.I have alot of houres in the game and i still really like it.I recommend this game to everyone! Good system Cheap and fun to play Updates almost every month New items getting added
1;Your car flies using nitro boosts to score a goal on a soccer match.A M A Z I N GReally tho it's a great game to pass time any pc runs it you can show off your stuns to people that doens't even play the game because the mechanics that builds it are simple.One of my best choices in Steam.
1;Rocket League is an addicting and highly competitive game! It combines machines and sports into an epic rocket car match. I recommend for any advanced or beginner gamers since the ranked mode can become quite exhilarating for experienced players! 10/10
1;Despite not being too big of a batman fan I'll definitely buy the Batmobile DLC to support the Psyonix devs. For less than $20 the base game (and no recurring membership fees required to play online) is more than worth it. RL DLC's aren't pay to win and for most part only contribute to aesthetics. So as long as I keep enjoying the game I'll keep buying the DLC's to keep the development funded. Recommend you guys do the same!See you at the kickoff!
1;"""friends get hyped about new car soccer game get me to spend $20 install game open it yeah cars playing soccer try to enter a party """"not connected to rocket league servers"""" try to play a game without friends """"not connected to rocket league servers""""still fun playing with bots would r8 8/8 if not for the serversUpdate months later the game works I love it thank you based god."""
1;Go buy this game if you like cars soccer and a competitive challenge! It has the best ranking system I've ever seen in a game after playing ranked for a while you'll notice that you're playing against people that play almost identically to you. In this way the game challenges you to better yourself and rise in the rankings!
1;Great game one down side the cross platform with psn 40 of time psn players got 400 ping (only me) Than it lags me too and well they dont know to play every time i had 2 players from psn with me i lost one psn or none i win (just move to 2v2)But great game alot of fun
1;Really worth buying this game. I have slowly but surely managed to get a large portion of my friends to try the game out. They all still play the game to this moment it is very relaxing and much better than alot of games out there that really stress you out.
1;When I first started this game one thing was clear I couldn't do a thing. I could hardly hit the ball. I'd race toward it turn to give it a tap and go right around it. But no matter how hard it is to really get the game down or to git gud it just. feels. right from the very first moment. This game is amazing.
1;Probably my favorite multiplayer game of all time. Fun to pick up and impossible to master I don't see myself putting it down anytime soon. The creators are constantly releasing new free content and features and I cant wait to see what people do with the workshop.BUY IT
1;Very fun Game most fun with friends... But the friends should not be much better than you AND easily salted.Every other combination is ok(Better than you and not salty carry)(Salty and not as good as you maybe toxic but funny)Not too many but often updates with new content and the game developed a huge trading network.9/10 Consumes your time like nothing else (except maybe Minecraft)Would not buy again because i alredy have it but I can recommend it so go buy it god damn.
1;It's like soccer and hockey with rocket cars. What's not to like?This set itself up to be a great esport. It has simple rules and is fun to watch. Anyone can figure out how to play in a few minutes but the skill cap is high. Nothing in the matches is random other than the exact positioning of the cars and the ball. You get a (skippable) slow motion replay for every goal.
1;One of the most fun I've had with friends in a long long time.A much needed addition to the multiplayer space with a developer that is not only competent but has a friendly DLC plan to support the game for a long time. Free updates come with this of course and the DLC is all cosmetic.A true gem.
1;this game has been out for how long and you still dont have to goal line detection on point????? so many time have i seen someone make a goal line save and the detction says its still a goal even tho you can clearly see the ball not fully pass the line..... fix you
1;9/10 looks like a retard game but actually extremely technically difficult. You'll learn how to ball chase how not to ball chase then when and where to ball chase to be a good midfielder. 10/10 game if you have friends to play with regularly. Lost a point because a lot of people in the community are pretty crap to play with. Leavers people who want you to kill yourself people who want to forfeit immediately after letting one goal in. Will have you screaming like a retard but in a good way.
1;Originally this game reminded me of the good ole days of retro car battles on the N64. This adds a fun team based twist with basic soccer rules. The multiplayer is great local and online. And the DLC content adds alot more customization. I'm 60 hours in right now and it still has me! Recommened for anyone and everyone!
1;At first i thought it was a boring game... just some cars that are trying to score with a huge ballI proved myself wrong after playing it.10/10 one of the most addictive and fun games to play with friendsthe graphics are gorgeous especially after you score you get hyped af after that blast11/10 would reccomend trying this game out and if you dont like it just refund it
1;Even if you don't like football you will like this game devs bring everytime new content in the game it's fun you can play hours and hours ! The game is cheap just go ) just know that you need to play with a controller forget the keyboard + mouse configuration ofc.
1;This is high quality edge of your seat fast paced fun.I have always been a competitive gamer and this game is one of the best. Each game has the potential to be the l negative 5 minutes of your life and I love every moment of the eternity that is a close game.
1;As a fan of the PS3 game this was a must buy and even though I knew what to expect I'm still overwhelmingly happy with how the game turned out. I have never met anybody that didn't like playing its predecessor and I can't imagine I will meet anyone that doesn't like playing Rocket League.
1;Fun. One of them games you can come back to time and time again. Always gets more challanging due to the fact that the players continue to get better. May be a bit hard for newbies to the game as they have to go againest players that have played for years. Either way fun game.
1;Rocket League is an addictive game once a player learns how to control the cars. It's fun and can be fairly relaxing when playing in career mode (depends on the player based on how you play in multiplayer games). The art visuals and music are great and it has a lot of updates and replayability. It's a favorite for a reason. 10/10 since it never gets old.
1;GOAT. I've never been happier with a purchase on Steam. I don't like soccer I'm not really into cars. But put them together and it's the best thing since sliced bread. I can't recommend this game enough.Still remains the best 20 dollars not counting all the crates that I've ever spent.
1;I've been playing Rocket League for a while now and I think it's safe to say I'm addicted to it..... I mean the game is full if child flaming.....but if you have a couple of folks to play with you're gonna have a blast with the game. There're gonna be times when you will be forced to ragequit due to a series of losses and missed goals (trust me you're gonna freak out ) in the other hand though there are gonna be wonderful memories. &lt 3
1;Low skill to enter but very high skill ceiling.You can go from barely hitting the ball to freestyling shots off the walls in a couple hundred hours with practice.Very fast paced.Quickchat and crossplay mean that you don't often get toxic players and Psyonix has made it easy to ignore them mostly for chat.
1;This game is fantastic! Love it to bits! The artwork and style of the cars is great.But I've been having issues the game has crashed on me twice now and both times a colored screen will cover my monitor. First it was all dark green then the latest time it was all orange. Not sure what the issue is but I know that there is one.
1;Spent numerous hours on this game and plan to spend many more. Spent $9 on it and have gotten my money's worth multiple times over.This game is excellent if you're into competitve games. Even better if you play with a group of friends.The physics are great and you will no doubt get really excited and really in every game because of them.10/10 would recommend.
1;Hi Everyone I just recently got into Rocket League and I must say its been a load of fun . It is a very challenging game lots of room for skill improvement and tactics on the players part . Keeps me coming back for more . A perfect diversion on these cold winter days !
1;At first look somebody will tell that the game is boring it is just a car which chase the ball. But that is not true the game is pure fun and I must recommend it to everyone. It is easy for everyone to start you dont need any skill to start it is beginner friendly but if you want to advance it becomes really hard. Only downside is that it is really addictive game when you start you cant stop playing the game.
1;When I bought this game I had no idea what to expect I didn't understand why my sister liked this game so much...Now after 400+ hours of playing I think I understand.I still can't fly or quickchat though... So I'd give it a 9/10 Tutorials are for noobs I missed my chance )
1;Best game ever!I LOVE THIS GAME! very addictive but still so much fun I really do love psyonix for coming up with this kinda game. Nothing to say other than i will not stop playing or uninstalling unless psyonix puts the game down themselves BTW i think is a big mistake I love it!
1;One of the best games I've ever played aside from Zombie Army Trilogy Counter Strike Global Offensive and The Binding of Isaac. I enjoy playing this game with a few friends and kicking back. It's a bit of a challenge. You'll need a goal keeper and the others to go out on the field and play. At times the goal keeper will need to move from goal long enough to block the other teams goal or to help out a bit but not for very long.
1;Few games in recent memory allow for such a broad range of players to engage with such a simple system in such an engaging manner. While anyone can pick up a controller and play the skill ceiling is endless. I can't wait until I can walk into a pub and watch a Rocket League match on the big screen.
1;One of the best multiplayer games I've played in a long time. Addictive isn't the word for it. 15 hours in 2 days haven't done that since Halo 2.Sweet graphics incredibly fun gameplay with or without friends (if your lonely like me then ranked mode is for you) and loads of customisation (including a rainbow of flowers for a rocket trail).Unreal's engine plus rocket powered cars a large bouncing bomb and 2 goals. It's the simple things that you enjoy the most.
1;I would recommend this game definitely it is a lot of fun to play however it is pretty repedative kind of the same thing over and over again for that I give it a 6 out of 10 I strongly suggest adding some sort of clan system on this game as well as tournaments and multiplayer seasons it would definitely bump up my score if that was to happen and I think this game would become crazy popular really quick if those features were added
1;After picking this up day 1 it has been the only PC game I've ever stuck with competitively. Controls are easy to pick up at first and hard to master at the high levels. Progression is extremely fun and certain aspects and techniques are introduced naturally as you get better. Could not recommend enough.
1;Easy to learn hard to master.Amazing soccer game combined with rocket cars with boost (nitros) on arenas. You can jump fly and crash your opponents!Very addictive and that's why it's awarded with ''Just 5 more minutes'' award )I highly recommend it to my friends and people that are seeking fun and some new experience with soccer games D
1;This game is great you get so much content and whilst they have extra DLC it isn t DLC to complete the game nor is it excessive. The gameplay is great crisp intense and extremely satisfying. 100% Recommend. If you can pick it up in sale even better!10/10
1;this game is an amazing game. Not a powerful computer is needed to run this game on Quality settings. My computer isn't very good but I can run this game on max settings on a laptop. Some maps may lag for me at high settings but most maps don't. I reccomend buying this game as it is great fun.
1;Just buy it.. Hours of fun with your friends unlockables that don't throw off the balance of the game. The only thing I would suggest to the Dev's... a 5v5 mode would be insane with a larger field especially for Hockey...DLC does not give advantages over those who are new to the game. Purley cosmetic.A Great Game.
1;"""""""Easy to learn difficult to master.""""Rocket League is great and must be experienced to be understood. The developers are fantastic as well and put a lot of time and effort into the game new content is still added frequently and a lot of it is free.Great experience all around. Don't miss out."""
1;This game is amazing. I'm more of a casual gamer and I fell in love. It's a pleasant mix of soccer and what I call race cars for the simple fact that speed is a factor in this game. Whether you're a serious gamer in search for something new to play or just a casual gamer looking for something fun to do online with friends this is the game to get! XD
1;"""Such a simple game yet its one of my favourites ever. They combine 2 things that almost every man loves cars and football and let me tell you they did a perfect job at it. The games are 5 minutes long which means you're either laughing your off for 5 minutes or you are whining like a little baby for 5 minutes. It also sets for the perfect example for """"Just 5 more minutes mom"""". Rocket League is truely amazing.10/10 would IGN again.Ervli"""
1;My hands down choice for Game of the Year in 2015 Rocket League is by far one of my all time favorite games.Soccer and cars...not much else to say. Its crazy mad simple fun. There is a steep learning curve but once you get the hang of flying and aerials you can compete with most people.A must buy especially considering it's low price.
1;Physics based football game with cars that flies with turborockets. That's crazy enough isn't it? Even if I don't enjoy the competitive aspect of the game Rocket League has an original gameplay that deserves to be played. Recommended to both casual and competitive gamers.
1;I originally got this game for free on the ps4 with plastation plus. put a few hundred hours on that and then saw rocket league on sale on steam. Purchase to compare. Steam wins by a landslide! Either way buy this game if you want to have a stupid good time! Just hope you don't go up against me! D
1;"""EDITED Pros Very fun and simple Car customization Easy to pick up hard to master (pretty hard)Cons If you don t live in any of the regions that dedicated servers are in your connection will be horrible May run slow in some computers9.5/10 """"A little laggy"""" MonsaEDIT Dedicated servers in South America are a thing now but its still a little laggy"""
1;Fantastic gameplay and little to no connection issues. Personally I stay within the US East and West regions. I've experienced minimal trolls and no hackers. Fun non stop gameplay and the matches last the perfect amount of time. If you have a bunch of friends that need that one game to play with a lot of non stop fun I highly recommend this game.
1;Rocket Leauge is really good game.Its all about teamwork and sometimes solo play.You can play plenty of gamemodes.U have great rewards that you can can get after a match .There are also some other cool features that are trurly amazing.Do I recomend this game.Yes I do.
1;I've never been a fan of soccer. Pretty boring sport if you ask me. However This is the best game ever made. I have 2500 hours in the game and I am not stopping any time soon. It's easy to get into the game and start learning the basics. You can join in matches and play with others at your skill. Then as you improve so will your competition. The skill cap is huge on this game. There's always new skills and techniques being discovered like the wave dash and ceiling shots. Buy it!
1;"""This game is amazing. You start by barely knowing how to move around. Maybe you jump even hit the ball a few times. Then some er sails through the air juggling the ball past you like """"What now bro?"""" and you're hooked.""""What a save!""""""""What a save!""""""""Savage!""""Can't recommend this game enough. Buy it for your friends."""
1;Great game I played the original and im glad they made a sequel as the camera and various other small things made SARPBC difficult to play at times. However I think as an improvement you could add possibly playlists of music for the game As me personally im not a fan of that kind of music and end up listening to my own. Otherwise tbh its a great game definitely reconmend
1;I CAN'T STOP PLAYING SEND HELP.Rocket League is a combination of football and rocket powered cars done in such a way that it is far greater tha the sum of its parts. It is a very balanced skill based game with the wise choice of a cosmetic only based DLC model. Every time a DLC for this game comes out I'll straight up buy it regardless of the content purely because I feel Psyonix needs more of my money for such a brilliant brilliant game.Sidenote Play this with a controller trust me.
1;I've played a good 500 600 hours of this game. I love it more than any other game I think I've ever played. This game is a great way to relieve stress by just playing casual or you can take the sweaty route in this game and try to climb the vigorous ranking ladder. Overall this game is an amazing game and I recommend it for anyone. This game is really easy to learn but super hard to master. Im only a Plat 2 but I am still improving to this day. I highly recommend giving this game a shot!
1;I am not a big fan of racing games or soccer games but this is definately worth the $20. Demolition derby and soccer at the same time is really fun. 10/10Only downfall is the unstable servers but it's not frequent enough to where it ruins the game. I am sure the servers will be upgrade in the near future.Definately buy this game!
1;"""Friend in College once showed me this game I told him it looks stupid. tried it on a free weekend then bought.one year and 1000+ hours later I realised what I meant by """"stupid"""" was that this game looks stupid... fun.5/7.Cant wait for Rocket League Battle Powered Boost Stealing Stop spamming skip repley dont use what a save saractically no I will not unistall the game and no i will not stop trying hard Acrobatic cars 3.gg."""
1;Great game.Make sure you practice before entering competitive mode some peoples just forgot on how to have fun in this community but if you don't mind the trolling and looking for a great way to let some steam off this action packed soccer like game is for you.Beside theres no need for flashy hot cars in order to win just skills aaaaand a bit of luck XD.
1;Great game i recommend it. I think the graphics are really good. Also the servers are fanstastic im stuck right now with Celluar Data because my internet services are anoyying but i get less than 100 ping which is amazing. The car cuztimizations are fantastic+trading included. There are a couple cons for example the the only way to buy keys without trading them is to spend real money on them.
1;I came back to RL to give it a new chance after a few patches. Some of the issues have been fixed and even though I still have 100 ping or more most games the game is a fair bit more fluid and predictable. There are still netcode issues but at least progress has been made.
1;Rocket league is a fast paced motorized version of soccer with cars. This game is one of the most unique and fun to play games to come along in a long time. As Rocket league has matured over the years so has it's playerbase. The competetive scene for this game has always had a small dedicated following but in recent years its Pro league scene has exploded.
1;I bought this cheap game as a recommendation. This now might be one of the most fun games in my game catalog. It takes soccer and cars with customizations and mixes them together with an extremely good multiplayer base and creates one of the best games i have played. Strong upvote!
1;What can I say? Been playing this since it came out in 2015 but am now part of the PC Master Race. The game is godly and I've probably played more than 3000 hours combined on all platforms. It is an innovative take that requires some getting used to but its awesome to play. Even better with friends...
1;Great game even sometimes when i have a short amount of time i can squeze in a game. Loving the skins and the trading system. Overall brilliant. If you would like to play a simple fun game this is a definite purchase. Wait for a sale it goes down to 9 euro. Use a controller i find it better
1;this game is so nice and thank for everything its very cool when u play mode servivle the monster is so scared us and has high damge the cars is very good u can run away easy the building is good all of things is good and you are good the sestym is good the game is good i cant express more than this game unbeliveable really amazing im sorry if i have mistake the life is wonderful iits ok
1;I think it might be the most balanced multiplayer experience I've ever played.Extremely addictive I stayed up until the early hours of the morning for days in a row playing solidly. Pretty quick to pick up and it isn't frustrating even when you lose. There is a constant drive to keep playing and practicing even after you have learned how to play.
1;Great game! So much fun! There definitely needs to be a best connection option from the servers plus the location because some of the games I join the connection is awful and I can't play! Particularly annoying in 1v1 ranked because you can't play properly.
1;"""Just incredible the skills you can learn alot of possibilities . Fair ranking system for me some say it's unstable but for me it's alright . Highly recommended for people who likes to try new stuff out ( ex. ceiling shot wall to air dribble air dribbling etc. ) been playing for 500 hours and everytime I play it the game will be like """" come play more """" you get what I mean ? My point is that it is addicting so yeah ."""
1;I cannot put into words how amazing this game is. Gameplay is highly satisfying and endlessly enjoyable. The DLC is only cosmetic and is very reasonably priced new maps and content are free cross platform play with PS 4 users and 4 player local play. You need to buy this game. It will complete you.
1;11/10. I got this game because everyone was on it and I felt left out. Wasn't expecting much considering i'm not a fan of football. But it's highly addictive.I strongly recommend partaking in the tutorials to give yourself a headstart in online play though!
1;REALLY FUN GAME!! If you like collecting items that make your car look amazing and then you love the action of an explosion of a car or a celebration that makes you go flying across the map and you love stradegy games that have teamates or just by yourself this is the game! NO BETTER GAME LIKE THAT FOR THIS PRICE!! I LOVE IT!
1;Great game. Works fine on Windows but on Kubuntu 18 04 the buttons aren't working correctly. I've checked in the KDE Joystick input device settings to make sure they're setup correctly on the OS and they are but in the game X doesn't work Y is X RB is START and there's a couple other buttons that are switched. Could still be the OS even though they're right in the settings but if not I hope this gets fixed.
1;Very addictive game when playing online multiplayer. One game is 5 minutes it always fits in when you have a bit of spare time left.Also this game is very cool when you are having friends over. You can play with 4 people with controllers on a big screen really nice.
1;I don't normally play racing games or sport games in general but man is this game worth the 20 bucks. You unlock something new after every game you play so there is tons of customization and I'm sure there will be more to come in the future. It also has a SUPERB soundtrack seriously the best one I've heard in a while. Super competitive adreneline rushing gameplay. And you can speed up and ram somebody in the butt to make them explode!
1;10/10SO MUCH FUN. Honestly i play it just about everyday with friends and it never gets old. With many different car models different designs and tons of colors no two cars are the same. Highly reccomend it even if you arent a fan of soccer! This is really a must have for all Steam users especially if you like jumping on a voice chat program and playing games with friends.
1;Very nice game. I started playing this game when all other games started to fell boring. Rocket League will refresh you need for gaming. So I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't know what to play next. Also it is a game that takes time to get good and a lot more to master it. But I don't recommend it you people who get triggered in a second because this game already has to much of toxic players.
1;Without a doubt one of the best games ever made Fun and challenging after all this time. The controls are intuitive but also real challenge to master not because a fault by the developer but because of the very nature of puting a ball on the goal whit a car. I can realy recomended this masterpiece.
1;Definitely One of the greatest game that I have ever came across.I mean seriously who doesn't like a game that kicks a giant F**king ball around. (not to be offended for those who doesn't)But for laptop gamers be aware prepare yourself with some icebag or external fans because you are going to need it.
1;A fantastic game in every way that games should be.Most importantly it is without a doubt the most fun I have had since CS 1.6 ! Everything about the gameplay is designed to be skill based fun! Well worth your gold coins!If you need some help watch this guide I madehttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v n36fldtHYzw
1;As a huge Mario Strikers fan this game peaked my interest on release. I finally decided to drop $20 to try it out. Probably the best $20 ever spent since Minecraft. Rocket League is easy to learn has high mechanical gameplay and has a competative nature. It is very fast and easy to join matches online and play with friends. Since I do enjoy TF2 Yes... Yes there are hats.
1;"""i now have over 150 hours invested into Rocket League and all i can truly say is i still enjoy the game the want to rank up in competive mode and earing rare new items keeps me coming back it""""s a game where practice makes perfect so i enjoy the end result of playing alot visually it is a very pretty game with a fun and hooking idea still one of my go to games 9/10."""
1;Extremely fun has great mechanics and awesome soundtrack you need this game! God I just realized I sound so much like those fake reviews on those video game commercials.Rev up those fryers cus' I'm GET OUT OF MY ROOM I'M PLAYING ROCKET LEAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!
1;I love this game it's a great game to play just for fun or for the competitive player.Pros Great mechanics great visuals great customization a wide array of modes great leveling Cons controls can be a bit weird at first no making a party between ps4 and pc.
1;This is currently my favorite game and I would definatly recomend this game to anyone with a love of competition. I currently have about 50 hours played and I just cant get enough of this game. Would r8 8/8!I mostly just wanted to give a positive review
1;runs smooth even on older computers best played with a controller (i'm playing with a ps3 controller works great).i hope future updates will make the game even better and add more items reporting players etc.it's easy to pick up since you really only need a couple of buttons not a million button combos like in fifa. yet it is very challenging to master it and the learning curve is just right i think.
1;"""Really sad that I let this sit in my library for so long (was accepted into alpha) before trying it. Probably the best """"sports"""" multiplayer game on PC since EA likes to treat us like step children and Konami has had the same online client/quality since the Playstation 2 days."""
1;Rocket League is an amazing game for everyone. It can be played online or against bots although I highly recommend playing online because the bots are terrible teammates. Its skill based matchmaking works very well so if you aren't good or you're new to the game then you're set up against people that are in the same position but if you're good at the game it get very competitive. There are more relaxed modes for fun too. This is probably my favorite game of all time.
1;By far one of my favorite games! It never gets old and has amazing replayability!There are many different modes to choose from such as Standard Rumble Hoops etc all while maintaining fair and enjoyable online gameplay. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fast paced multiplayer game.10/10
1;First Off I do not like sports games. Sport games can get really complex to the point of why do I need to learn all of this? This game Rocket League is like SSX Tricky was back on the PS2. Stupid and Simple fun. SSX has Uber Tricks. Rocket League has Aerials and Defense madness to just name a few.The game is easy to pickup but very hard to master espeically once you get to the higher rankings.
1;Who doesn't like the idea of Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars playing soccer. Anybody can get into this game since it's something that everyone can pick up easily. It has some casual or competitive fun. The skill ceiling is always getting higher there are always new things to learn when you are at the top of this game.
1;Best game i've played since ages sincerely never had love for soccer games except for neketu from NES and later a little appreciation for mario striker.but this! really futuristic cars with jet &amp jumping capabilities plus updates plus speed plus explosions and spinning..ok try and buy. True story.
1;A great game that I can pick up for a few minutes or for a few hours depending on the amount of time I have available. One can play this game in such a way so that they learn all the tactics or the can play it casually for fun. Either way it's a great expirience.
1;This is a great game.I will be hitting 1000 hours in this game soon and I am still going strong. This is a highly competitive game where even the best players don't seem to be able to see the skill ceiling yet.The only improvement I'd ask for is more transparency in how the reporting system works.
1;This game never gets boring if you are a friend of soccer or cars or even both!I am still playing it day after day and already am about to it the 600 hours mark.Whenever I should tell people about a nice game they can play alone or with friends Rocket League comes to my mind.
1;Absolutely worth it for the price you pay. Hours of entertainment and has a place for both casual and competitive players. If you have any desire to rank up you'll need to practice mechanics. Thankfully the steam workshop community has multiple training packs for the people interested on focusing specific areas of their game.
1;10/10 I love it! This is the first game in a long time that I've hit 200+ hours and I'm still absolutely addicted. There is always something to improve on always a way to get better. And opening crates is super fun too!! I'm not into the trading scene but it seems super cool as well!
1;This is a great game!I have played about 400 hours of this and still haven't grown tired of it. The community is very nice and helpful.They make seasonal events but not very often.All in all it's my favourite steam game and i give it 10/10 ) (in this genre)
1;Even if you dont like football you will like this game.It's a very addictive game and can be enjoyed by all ages.The split screen is very nice if you have 2 monitors you can set the resolution settings higher than the in game setting in the settings files of Rocktet League that way if you have multiple controllers you can play with your friends or family while not having to look at a small part of the screen.even though there are a lot of dlc's they are all cosmetic so this game is not p2w.
1;Product received for free. I got this game as a free addon to my steam controller in Sept 2015.Have thuroughly enjoyed playing this hilarious game.Crates can be turned off which is great.I'm limited in ranked league matches because my nerves don't keep up with more skilled players.All in all a super fun game.
1;"""Still learning the basics.Not a joke. The game is easy and fun to get into but very complex to master. I don't consider myself even of average skill after these 300 something hours. Still fun as hell no matter I win or lose like sheeetz.Don t get fooled by the """"car soccer"""" theme the formula actually works and pretty well... never played an mp game so pure and refined since quake III arena.Doesn t need a beast machine to run at optimal playable speed."""
1;"""Absolutely blast to play if you don't mind ending up playing just one game... and another... just five more minutes... oh it's morning already? Suits for casual gaming as well as more serious gaming and believe me your competitive spirit will take a hold of you and you find yourself grinding for that next """"Division Up!"""" level raise."""
1;This game is absoultely Immaculate only word in dictionary that describes it. It for some reason gives me a feeling like no other game can fullfil the hype of every hit of the ball every aerial goal every goal period. If you want a game with great physics high skill ceiling pretty good community and like to drive cars and hit balls and score goals. This is the game for you!
1;Recently Rocket League has stopped working for me. All my other games have worked but Rocket League has just stopped working. Everytime I try to open and play it continuously updates and won't start. Can someone help me understand why? I want to play this game very much but recently it has stopped working and I can't play it. This game is very good not hate is going towards this game. I have no evidence to show that it is the game so no hate here.
1;It took me a bit of time to get the hang of it instead of just bashing myself in the general direction of the ball... but once you hit that point where you feel in control it's all downhill from there and wish your free time goodbye. Great game especilaly since i dislike football/soccer and cars. Devs are awesome. Community is one of the best i've seen. Just get it it's a lot of fun.
1;extremely addictive!!!This game is incredibly awesome!Its easy to learn and the fun is multiplied with the amout of friends you play the game with DThe only thing that could make this game even better more gamemodes (funmodes).But even with a single gamemode (playable 1v1 up to 4v4) its super fun and kinda never gets boring. I would reccomend this game especially for fans of football stock car or co op/multiplayer games
1;Great game very fun very skill based. I don't know about you but I like it and I think it was worth the money. The server issues were... well anyways besides that great game and using UE3 too I trust that engine so that helps. If your considering to get this game get it.
1;Love this game. I've only played in Exhibition and training but I already think it is amazing. It needs more online players but that can only come in time. It could also be cheaper it's not worth 15 at this stage of development a fiver maybe but not 15.
1;This game is so incredibly fun. I've had it since the day it came out and I haven't enjoyed any other game more than I have this.I'm not a big fan of football but Rocket League brings an air (literally you can fly) of enjoyment to me. I imagine a football fan may find it even better! Plus I'm literally addicted as you can see by my hours...
1;Highly recommend this game even from some one who hates football on all levels but loves cars this game is just fun in a box honestly. Amount of customisation is awesome aswell. You may think it looks easy but it does actually take a degree of skill to be good at it.
1;Rocket League is a thoroughly enjoyable time with a large amount of unlocks and customizablility. The overall premise is pretty simple but the mechanics thrown into car soccer make this game stand out. I do recommend finding a couple of friends to regularly play with as then you aren't stuck relying on the random match maker.
1;This is the counter strike source of the modern era. Highly competitive high addictive easy to pick up and incredibly difficult to master.Thought soccer was stupid......thought RC cars were stupid....but combine them both and magically its amazing.Controller highly recommended.
1;Personally I love this game But the one complaint that I have seen a lot is that it can be very boring at times Because it's virtually the same thing over and over I believe that the reason people fall in love with this game is because of how fun it can be with friends Thats why I think you should implement a full out online match making mic system for certain teams Like CSGO.
1;Haven't wrote a review for a game in a while but this game simply deserves one. It's simple and fun yet it also manages to really promote skillful play at the same time.I haven't encountered any bugs yet but I have experienced some connection problems nothing too serious though!I can't recommend this game enough for such a fair price and of course it's more fun with friends.
1;Extremely addictive and fast paced. If you love driving cars and crazy flips and spins this is the game for you. I have been unable to put the controller down for this. I definitely suggest using a controller for this game as it makes it easier than trying to use the mouse/keyboard.
1;Extremely fun game No hackers Skill based Not many toxic Russians A little teamwork but you should always try to hit the ball every time and never let your teammates get the chance becauseyou are superious to them in every way and remember if they ever try to hit the ball make sure they miss and ridicule them for it Mostly nice ppl
1;Mad fun to play alone to gain rank or with friends to mess around. I have over 310 hours on the game now and it's one of my go to games to play when I want to just relax and kick back. The customization options for your car are crazy and newer things are being added every update with crates. Great for de stressing and having some good fun.
1;This is by far the most fun I've ever had on a game. As what most would consider a sports gamer when I first purchased this game I thought it was stupid and would never live up to games like Fifa Madden and 2k. I couldn't have been more wrong Rocket League is like a never ending dose of competition with a forever growing skill gap. Even now new ways of controlling cars or hitting shots are being discovered which gives this game a long life spam. 100% worth the pick up.
1;Bought this game for 20 bucks off the steam store..... It's very addicting as several game modes and a usually bright community. I highly suggest this game for anyone though this review is coming from a guy who's played about 2 754 hours worth of it ) BUY IT
1;This game is probably one of the most enjoyable games out there even more so for its price. The only issues I've noticed have been minor server issues (Particularly if you're from an Asian country or Africa) and some issues with the way the system is. (That being people leaving games early in all modes including ranked.)It's worth the cost and the DLC isn't necessary unless you're going for achievements. It's fun. Fun for the whole family.
1;As you can see I currently have 1 200 hours in this game. Once you get into the game there is no stopping. The skill ceiling is yet to be reached and isn't anywhere close to being reached. This might just be the best $20 you will ever spend in your life. 10/10 would pay $60 for.
1;My absolute favourite game... There is no way you could get bored of it! So many possibilities! I love the fact that it looks like a game you could play on a game console even though I am playing it on PC! The graphics are fantastic gameplay is simple I would like to see some more free DLC that you can earn but that is just a minor problem and I am probably nitpicking! Well done Psyonix!
1;Possibly one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played. As someone who doesn't enjoy sports games and only somewhat enjoys racing games I was shocked to find how much I enjoy a game about cars playing soccer.The controls are incredibly tight the presentation is spot on and I just can't say high enough praises about everything else in this game. It's perfect buy it!
1;i don't like football games and i hate racing games but this is really a great game.this is by far the game i played the most over the last few years.2 hints dont try to play this with mouse and keyboard use a controller. never team up with ppl much(!) more advanced than you are the enemys you will get will be fun breaking for you. team up with someone as skilled as you are and it's big fun.
1;Rocket League is a game that is easy to pick up and hard to master. The fun in the game comes from the never ending drive to get better and the ability to play with or against friends. Optional paid cosmetics also allow players a reward for playing online and helps establish a trading economy that the developers are very mindful of. This game is amazing because of the constant new updates to the game content and list of skills players have.
1;Seriously fun game!!!played it alot its very fun to play with friends or alone. most of the people are very nice (defenitly not all!!). the competative ranked system is also very good and not that frustating to play.the matchmaking is very good you have no long waittimes ever!there is made alot of new content over and over again for this game wich i really like.if you want a very fun to play game to play alone or with friends this is the ideal game for you!
1;This is literally my favourite game. There are a lot of toxic people in the community but what game doesn't? Plus you can just mute them. Overall I would definately recommend this game to anyone whether they are new to gaming or a veteran who has been playing for years.
1;Rocket League is a good game to play with friends but playing random people online can be bad it's basically get better or off! I met some cyber bully while matching online...Well this game like other online sport games you become better while trash talking other gamers. It is a good game for bro gamers and people into sport games but don't know the rules of actual sport games like FIFA or NBA 2K. Okay game I recommend it but don't match online until 20 hours of solo playing.
1;Besides being one of the best games I've played in a while Rocket League is just one of the best feeling games aswell. It feels very snappy and precise. This is a huge plus as the shots you need to pull off require this very optimized engine. But this game also looks amazing on top of amazing fps and very snappy controls. 10/10 would recomend to anyone who likes a new esport.
1;Really cool watching the esports of this game I wish scammers couldn't get away so easily anyways hope this game becomes a really memorable game somewhat in the future. It is very easy to understand this game in ways other games don't have. It is truly a one of a kind game.
1;With me having a few hours in the game by now I found this game to be very fun for the first couple hundred of hours. However it seemed to start to get boring eventually. I still would recommend this game to a person who loves football and cars. I love those two things but after a lot of hours this game starts to get very repeatitive. The graphics and all are great for the game. The gameplay is also astonishing very very fun at the start and middle of your playing.
1;I love it but it only plays a maximum of 2 or 3 games before shutting off my whole computer (usually only half of a game). I have a 1200W Coolmax Power supply and 2 Nvidia GXE 760's so I think it would be an issue with the game since it runs games like GTAV online with no lag on highest settings. Is it the computer or the game? I've tried everything
1;Awesome game but can I point out one SERIOUS FLAW. If you solo que for a 2v2 ranked match and the game fails to match you with another solo que. CANCEL THE GAME. DONT FORCE A FRIGGIN 2V1. Such a over site. other than that BS thing game is most certainly worth the 20$.
1;Provided countless hours of insane fun playing this game over teamspeakwith my mismatched group of friends! This games brings me back the joyI had as a kid playing halo 1 &amp 2 with the bros!Games plays and runs great easy to play very hard to master!Havent been this tence while playing a game in a long time islitterally teeth grindlingly good fun!
1;Easy to learn difficult to master. This game not only supports splitscreen but it also allows players on the same machine to queue up and face the world.Matches (maybe even surpasses) Nidhogg in the number of shouts it elicits from spectators and players alike.
1;I now have over 1300 hours in this game though I'm not a super champ or anything worth bragging about. Still it has remained fun for SO LONG that I can't help but consider it one of my favorite games of all time. GGS!Play it for an hour... you'll know if it's your kind of game fairly quickly.
1;The best $20 I've ever spent on a game. Steep learning curve to be able to compete with the top tier players but so much fun even for the casual player. I've logged hundreds of hours on the XBOX ONE console just switched over to PC two weeks ago and already have logged 25+ hours. Endless fun! I recommend Rocket League to ANY and EVERYONE
1;Fast chaotic easy to pick up but hard to master. Online matches are found quick (YMMV) and match making is decent at finding skilled players around your skill. Thousands of customization to play with and each car feels different on the field. Community usually very nice even had people throw a match to help my improve my shots! You won't find a more unique and balanced online game than this.
1;"""Totally awesome game! The game offers the unique experience of playing soccer with CARS. That is just awesome! The atmosphere is also pretty awesome between the fans screaming in the stands the announcer/horns and the visuals! What some people who are somewhat familiar with this game may not know is that it has a """"Season"""" mode which is kind of similar to a campaign and feels pretty awesome as well."""
1;When you create a physics engine and place a ball and remote control cars you get this such a simply yet entertaining game which actually promotes a competitive atmosphere. I have yet to get bored of this game and I feel like I've put so many hours already. Not to mention the fact that the developers still are creating new DLC to keep the game contemporary for everyone to enjoy themselves and have endless fun. Seriously a great game both casually and competively.
1;Super fun and addicting game. Good matchmaking with good playlists 1v1 2v2 3v3 each with normal or ranked options. Game is polished and controls are fluid and feel real. Physics are spot on. Worth more than $20 easily. 100s of free items amd free added stadiums for no extra cost.
1;Great things Online matchmaking is fantastic. Can launch the game and be playing an online match within 15 seconds. Great gameplay doing backwards bicycle kicks in your car or doing aerial Mctwists to score goals is a lot of fun. Great customisation Viking horns and a love heart antenna on my buggy Good graphics and physics Smashing a ball at just the right angle and hearing a thud as the ball rockets away is the best.Bad things I'm suppose to be working instead of playing this game.
1;Game is great. What can i say that has not already been said....*note you can only play with xbox and ps4 folks in private matches which is annoying. (you can not team up with them to play random online players)You turn on the game cuz your bored play a few medicore games. But you get in the one lucky shot I mean that shot your planned.... Satisfaction.
1;After this anniversary this game deserved a review PROS&gt chillest community&gt still relevant&gt gameplay is fun gets your palms sweaty. animations are very fluid&gt has better soundtracks than most Arcade Style gamesand the DLC's are always great prices what more could you ask for?CONS&gt I suck at it8.5/10
1;This one is literally one of my best games I've ever played ! I recommend it. You have many combinations of colorful colors on your car. Accessories antennas.... If you want to play fun multiplayer and ranked game Rocket League is your choice ! I'm playing it with joystick because is easier but if you don't have you may play with your keyboard.
1;A game about cars and football... what can be wrong with that?Addictive fun easy to play (but difficult to master) lots of players online hundred of visual items (skins antennas etc) but nothing about pay to win (yeah!!).You said you don't like football? That doesn't matter this game will make you forgot about that last thing (I have some friends under that situation haha).All I can say is... I ing love this game.
1;"""""""It s a simple thing done brilliantly well kept interesting by the thrill of competition."""" PC GamerI think this quote describes this game perfectly! It is the perfect party game but can be way more than that. Rocket League is easily my favourite game of 2015 thanks to the fantastic developers working on it.Also cars+rockets+football/soccer... what could go wrong?"""
1;its one of the best football game i ever played. i don't buy very much games as i think they don't really worth it but this game did worth each penny.sadly a lot of people quit the game but i hope that will be changed somehow maybe with some bans .i recommend this game for sure .i give it a 10/10. D
1;(Clutch moment in overtime) (About to rank up)Pass to teamateBump opponents out of the wayAll my teamate has to do it lightly hit the ball inTeamate decides freestyling is the perfect ideaFREESTYLING IS NOT THE PERFECT IDEATEAMATE COMPLETLY WHIFFS THE BALL AND EAT THE WALLOpponents score They winDerankBut thats why I love this game
1;"""This game is a gift that never stops giving. Honestly the community is good and the skill ciling keeps increasing making it impossible to """"never get better"""". Im still hooked on the ranking system after playing around 1500 hours of the game in just over a year (that's how sad I am).Would smash10/8 would lift againWorth money"""
1;This game is amazing go play it. You might feel like the biggest noob when you start out but you wont mind because of the fun centred philosophy that hides behind it. Its not trying to get you trough any grinding. Every game I've played has been its own special little snowflake as for the people I have been playing with. 100% worth the 20 euro's.See you online.
1;Had a game where it went into overtime tied at 4. Spent 5 minutes and 48 seconds and overtime and finally scored the winning shot! Keep in mind that regulation time is 5 minutes so the OT was long then reg time.10/10 would play another 6 minutes in over time.
1;If you like competetive games This is a MUST PLAY. It is amazing. Easy to learn but a real high skill ceiling! Ive been playing over 600 hours and I still suck.If you like soccer This is better than FIFA games and much closer to real soccer than those games ever were!I replaced my Starcraft and League of Legends for this game and I do not regret it!
1;I was waiting for this game to go on some sort of sale but I just had to buy it because it looked really cool. I have to say after 60 hours it's a game where you start out and you're still compared to other people but the room for improvement means I could be playing this game for a while. Oh yeah and the developers seem really cool and they like to interact with the community a lot.
1;Even if you dont like soccerThis Game is tons of FunAll online Funktions are working and this is unusual for the half produced games you find these times.The only bad thing to mention is that you cant form teams between PS4 and PC Players.You can play with all of em but forming teams is limited to members of your Gaming Platform.
1;Rocket League is the quintessential casual friendly steep learning curve packing endless entertainment gold standard sports game for newcomers and veteran gamers alike. If you can get this game on sale DO IT. If you cant get this game on sale buy it anyway. After thousands of games played with thousands of people all around the world I dont regret a single moment of time I've spent playing this game.
1;This game! I was not a bog fan of the game when it first came out so i did not buy it. I bought the game later because of my friend though and playing the game with friends and just communicating was so much fun it bought a smile on my face after hard days and i have memories where we would die of laughter. The mechanics of this game are great and sometimes weird but overall a really solid and well built game. Would definitly reccomend.
1;Day 1 Can't hit a stationary ball Boosting 24/7 And no controlDay 2 Might be able to hit stationary ballDay 3 Can definitely hit a stationary ball now Might be able to save a goalDay 4 Attempting Aerials. Failing Can probably score a goal nowDay 5 you're all over the place.Day 6 ....
1;One of the best multiplayer games I've ever played!It runs smoothly the matchmaking is brilliant and the overall gameplay is something you can sink your time into.There is so much customisation which is a big bonus as well as having the choice between 1v1's all the way to 4v4's. I highly recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in fast paced acrobatic multiplayer gameplay!
1;Friend convinced me to get Rocket League. They kept saying it was so awesome and fun but I was too stubborn. I finally got it and now all I want to do is invite all my friends to come play with me.. but then i realized I have no friends and came to you guys instead.10/10 SUPER FUN!
1;This game is awesome fast paced and so much fun. Its one of those simple to learn yet hard to master games when you have absolute control of your car. I play it with keyboard mouse combo with no problems. Only bad thing are servers it still gets pretty bad quite often especially in prime time.
1;Product received for free. If you dont play FIFA i would highly recommend this game if you already like football this is the best version of all games when your not playing FIFA in the interest of playing something that has anything to do with football. 5/5
1;"""Super fun to play online with friends. It can get really intense depends on how competitive you are as a person though I suppose... It's regularly updatet so there's always new stuff to achieve an win. I've had evenings where I stopped playing after 2 houres of saying """"just one more match"""". It really can be fun!"""
1;Likes High skill cap but low barrier to entry. Short intense rounds so you can either jump in for just one or play for the night without getting bored. Great team dynamics Not pay to winDislikes Too addicting Can't party cross console (although this is probably not the developer's fault)
1;I'm not a hardcore player but this game is the best I'ver ever met since 'ROLLCAGE'.I miss Rollcage very much it's not playable anymore with new Hardware but anyway 'ROCKET LEAGUE' ist a great spare!!!I'm new on Rocket League but I will play until my end....For YOUNG and OLD .. )
1;Rocket League is a very consistent and reliable game which can provide hours of fun. With many of the new (free) game modes the gameplay always feel refreshing. If you have friends to join you then it will be even more fun! I fully recommend this game and believe it is worth the $20.
1;Amazing gameplay gripping from start to finish of every game. Dynamics are brilliant and it's a pleasurably pretty game!Plus you can soul crushingly murder people in cold blood leaving a fiery explosion of death and despair in your wake... Never gets old!
1;Amazing game very addicting with great game mechanics. The splitscreen and full controller bonus are great too. I was able to play with my cousin on the same pc with 2 controllers and 2 monitors against other teams online. Haven't found any bugs yet either great gui and overall great game definetly worth the 20$!
1;It's a fun game... great fun with friends... if you've got a bunch of friends that like soccer or cars or both the this is the game for you guys. if you enjoy crazy chaotic fastpaced mayhem then grab your keyboard mouse and/or controller and play now!
1;If you've played SARPBC you'll love this game. Though right now every map in Rocket League is the same with a different skin. I'd like it if they introduced variable terrain maps like in the original. Otherwise this is a solid game with a sizable playerbase.
1;IT'S LIKE SOCCER BUT WITH CARS !VERY HIGH SKILL CEILING BUT EASY TO PICK UP.ONLINE IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE NO SENSE OF ANY SPORT STRATEGY (POSITIONING ROTATING DEFENSE / OFFENSE ...) SO TRY TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS INSTEAD !ADDICTIVE GAME OTHERWISE GOOD COUCH GAME TOO.THE AI IS PRETTY BAD BUT AN OFFLINE SEASONS MODE WHERE YOU PLAY WITH BOTS AGAINST BOTS IS A NICE ADDITION !9.5/10
1;A game done right no faults! Worth every penny.Except the players are awful you join an exhibition match and the other team calls you names and so do your team mates if you mess up and when ever you conceded a goal or two you team mate rages quits... why it's exhibition is doesn't even mean anything. Sorry I don't spend my whole life on this game.
1;Well it crashes every time I try to leave a lobby and the sound just died and now the game is completely silent every time I launch it and that's t but it's fun overall I guess.EDIT restarting the computer fixed the silence going borderless windowed fixed the crashing game is awesome.
1;"""A lot of gamers today look back at the Nintendo 64 or Playstaton 1 and think """"Those were the golden days.. simplicity yet super fun"""" ... they somehow captured this magic and brought it into the modern world. Even when I get slammed 0 5 in a match I leave happy. 10/10"""
1;Ahh rocket leauge. If Fifa and Forza had an incestial love chind this would be the baby. Not only is thig game cheap but it is alot of fun Constant customizations competitive games and fun games with friends are all things you will experience while playing this game.
1;Rocket league is the most fun that I have had recently in a video game. When I need a break from raging in Dota 2 or CSGO or just need a quick game to play that I can put down at any time Rocket League is the game to go to. Playing with friends makes the game 10x better but being alone is nothing to be unhappy about.Overall this game is fantastic and something everyone should have in their Steam inventory for the low asking price.
1;"""A simple concept perfectly executed. Has an incredible """"just one more"""" stickiness to it. I can't stop playing!!! It could use some mini games or challenges to break up the monotony and teach some more advanced strategies but for the price it provides a huge amount of fun."""
1;A highly competitive game with a seemingly infinite potential for skill development. After playing for hundreds or even thousands of hours you will surely still have much to learn. The fact that the learning curve isn't that difficult (you can jump right in for the first time and have a comparable ability as your opponents) creates a brilliant balance. Best of all the game is simply fun.
1;is a realy fun game but sinds the last update when i want to play a game and i click on play online and then find match it saysloading. then it will load the games/ playlists but this takes frever. i kept the game on for 1 hour and still it was loadingdoes someon know how to fix it or can someon fix this?i cant play a game just bicus the new update and the loading.
1;"""""""Perfection. That's what it's about. It's those moments. When you can feel the perfection of creation. The beauty of physics you know the wonder of mathematics. The elation of action and reaction and that is the kind of perfection that I want to be connected to.""""Samuel Anders Battlestar Galactica (#4.20)"""
1;Rocket League is a great mix of soccer and driving. It has that very nice mix of being fairly easy to pick up and play with a very straightforward goal but deep mechanics that mean you won't be flying up and knocking down arials on your first outing. The game is played best 2v2 or 3v3 so each member of the team is very significant much moreso than traditional soccer.
1;"""It's all fun and games until you get to veteran level and if you haven't mastered your aerials by then you're ed. ING TRYHARDS GET OUTTA MY GAMEEEEEEEEEEEE.Chat isn't even voiced not a single """"Shazbot"""" in there (not even """"Hi"""") it's all gay as hell.Great game for listening to podcasts and music though.Not worth the full price unless you're a dull person like me I guess."""
1;This game is great. It is a simple concept soccer with rocket cars but once you start getting the hang of it you realize how much depth you need to master. The games are short and action packed. It will keep you entertained for hours at a time with jaw dropping moments happening pretty often.
1;You will start this game and you will be terrible. You will try not to be terrible again and again. You will practice. You will get better. Then one day you will try to score a goal off a wall while soaring through the air on a plume of fire and the ball will go in on purpose and it will be so beautiful you will wonder wistfully about a world where this game doesn't exist and what a limp miserable place it must be for the people who live there.
1;There's an eff' ton of good reviews and for a good reason this game is mad and it only gets more enjoyable the more you play it.Repeating what many already have saidI HATE car games...I HATE sports games...I LOVE Rocket League!WARNING Controller is not obligatory but a must!
1;After 2 years of playing this game it is still by far one of the most creative and most fun games to play. Fast load times beautiful scenery around each stadium cool different game modes different types of customization for all vehicles CSGO simulator and most importantly salty competitive players.
1;In the beginning I thought I wouldn't enjoy this game so I never bought it. A friend then wanted me to get it so I could play with him so i decided to just get it it was on sale anyway. After a few hours I started getting a hang of the game and that was when I really started to enjoy it. Now every time I play it's like one more game please and an hour later I'm still playing. if you haven't picked this up yet i strongly reccomend it.
1;This game is everything you want for a fun chill game with your friends. Either on a split screen or online this game has it all. Competitive modes Chill funny modes with crazy acts or just practice against AI.It's the perfect combination between football and car games!
1;This is a really fun good game that is worth getting fot the price of it. A great feature is being able to connect your Xbox One controller or Play Station controller up to your PC and being able to use it to play this game. I also really like being able to play with people on PS4 while playing on PC.I'm sure you'll really enjoy this game and I would highly recommend it
1;simple fun. Remember the good old days when you and your siblings sat down to play a skill based game and get all excited when someone scored... Thats this game in a nut shell. Cool for playing with friends online. No dlc bs (yet) no purchasing scams. Just simple fun.
1;I very do recommend this game! I love playing rocket league with my friends. I always play this game almost EVERY SINGLE DAY! I'm glad that one of my friends recommended this game to me because if he didn't then I wouldn't have been writing this review.
1;This game is utterly fantastic. I picked it up a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. It has a steep learning curve at first but then everything clicks and it's one of the best competitive experiences out there. Tight controls and physics gorgeous visuals and satisfying gameplay all rolled into one wonderful little package. I would recommend this to anyone with a functioning computer
1;Easy to learn insanely difficult to master. The matches are a perfect length as to not demand too much time in one go and the gameplay is very addictive. This is worth it at the standard price but I'd still see if there are sales of any sort coming up through the winter season. I legitimately have no complaints with this game. 10/10
1;This game is revolutionary. Multi platform based game allowing pc and ps4 compete against each other. They've set it up so you play others around your skill level. Leveling up you play more experienced gamers. Never gets boring. Highly recommend you add this game to your steam library.... then ill smash you at rocket league.
1;I bought this game about a year ago and I loved it from start to end. I have came across friendly people and that were such good sports even though they lost or won. This game is recommended for playing by yourself and friends which is great. Buy it because it's worth it.
1;Product received for free. In my Opinion this game is actually fun and make me try hard to be a professional player.It's must practise and practise more to be skillfull player. On Graphic and Gameplay I like it a lot because 4D and Soccer by carHey guys I recommend for person who look for funny football game but not recommend for people who easily dizzy.This game can make you headace sometime XD I rate 8.5/10
1;Best casual game of the year! Tons of fun. Easy to learn hard to master. Player db is really good. The dlc's are great with new cars and models and everything. Gets regular updates and new maps are added occasionally.It's great to see such a simple idea could come to life in such a perfect way.10/10
1;Fantastic game I can pick it up and play a couple matches without commitment. Usually a couple matches turn into a dozen though. Always coming out with new vehicles arenas and modes of play that keep it fresh. It is also a great game for playing with friends to just catch up and have a good time doing something other than generic shooter 26.
1;Easy to learn hard to master and addicting as f***.Even tho it might seem a bit simple and repetitve in the beginning you can spend hour after hour trying to get better and climb devisions in competitve.Controller and friends to play with recommended.
1;Product received for free. Personally I think that thid game is very good. IM really bad a t football in real life and this game just lets me be free. Im the best at this game in my school and I always have competitions with people are barely know. What i think this game could improve is adding a keybourd championships because i use Keyboard and personally i think it would be a cool creative idea as of not many people use keyboard and it would be intersting to see.5 Stars
1;Brilliant Game Get a few friends to play with you and you'll have a ton of laughs.Edit After more playing my main concern is whether the game will still retain its original enjoyment in the future with only one type of game and all the maps having the exact same layout I can see it becoming boring further down the line. Bear in mind that this is still early days so they may add more in the future
1;This game is the best game I have ever played every 5 min match is a new feeling and a new game altogether you can spend hours on this game and caution this game may result in you failing your GCSEs lol. But its a hell of a game and i cant stop playing!
1;I decided to drop 15 for Rocket League and I am glad that I did. The gameplay is very simple but damn is it addictive. It is good fun to play with friends and also random players you encounter on line. The colourful graphics are great as well.It also has the Saltire (Scottish flag) in the game for attaching to your vehicle DI highly recommend this game!
1;I would recommend this game to everyone. Regardless of your skill level there is fun to be had. It's difficult to find a game that can be something silly to play after a few beers but also one of the most skill based games if you want something to practice playing.On the topic of practice there are few things more rewarding than when you finally start pulling off nice aerial shots.
1;MUST PLAY GAMEpros&gt Unlimited Fun&gt Car Customisations&gt Great Stadiums&gt Creative ways to score goals&gt Epic saves&gt Team work&gt Good servers&gt Great powers for the car to make the game more challengingcons&gt Highly adictive Time will go in a flash
1;CARS + FOOTBALL throwing your controller into the TV screen because you missed the easiest shot in the last seconds of the game and your team lost in overtime . Throw away your fidget spinners people cause this game is going to take care of your nerves .
1;Product received for free. This game is loads of whacky fun! The ability to customize my own little car made me feel special. The chaotic nature of the game leaves plenty of oppurtunity for failures and exhilirating successes. It does get a bit repetitive eventually but the multiple game modes help alleviate that. Not the deepest game but still loads of fun
1;Dear Psyonix I need to say that this game is amazing I am totally addicted to it and I am playing it before and after work to bad I cant install it on my job . I have no bad words for this game accept Matchmaking sometimes is missed and need more servers with more players. Honestly your Bane.EDIT THE MOST ADDICTIVE GAME EVER !
1;i bought this game at a sale and i can clearly say it is worth every penny even if it wasnt on a sale its still a great game thats very fun to play with friends or alone and its soo addivtive for example if you need to go to sleep but your gonnna play one more game good thing is that the game is only 3 5 minutes D
1;Great game. Don't get discouraged when you first get this game and you are terrible. This game takes a lot of practice to get even half way decent at it. Stick with it and you will get better. Get some friends and play this game and lose all of your free time. I've been playing since the first week and this game just keeps getting better and better. Get this game and just play it for a few days. You wont regret it.
1;This is now one of my go to games when i get on my computer.It is really fun with friends having a laugh and talking. i would give this game a 10/10 if the ranking system wasn't pretty poor. its just not fair matching pro(me) against masters. If this will get fixed defintenly a 10/10. i highly recommend you get this game.
1;Solid game. many many hours of fun. Theres only one problem ive been running into and its that somtimes when all my online games work good this one will give you the disconect symbol. Even though its been a reocuring annoyance this is a great game that is worth the price.
1;I've never written a review and I'll likely never write another one... This is hands down one of the best games ever developed and I'm extreemly glad Psyonix did this sequel proper... They took a solid game and improved upon it. Anyone waiting for this game to go on sale is wasting time worth every penny.
1;I was looking forward to this game when I first saw it announced. I was a huge fan of the Car Soccer mode in Forza 4 and I can say that this is 9 999 999 times better. Flying cars that can flip forward to kick the ball into the goal from across the field?! I'm in! This game relies on skill and having good teammates and that is what makes it great along with the car customization. I can't wait to see what they add in the future!!!
1;"""Warning This game is incredibly addicting. It's truly an embodiment of """"minutes to learn a lifetime to master"""" it's so simple yet leaves so much room for growth. It's great for blowing off steam after a long day as well as allowing you to push yourself if desired by honing your skills in training and playing against other high flyers. Well worth the purchase."""
1;Have played the game before and love it but for some reason on my mac it keeps shutting off abruptly and not letting me play. It is also super laggy unless I turn all settings to lowest quality while csgo runs properly on full quality. If you could help please message me over steam thanks.
1;This game has stolen my life and I don't even care. Ranked matches resetting your rank every few months is annoying as hell because then for weeks youll match up with gods and be obliterated so it's unplayable during that period.. That fact alone takes it down to 4 stars for me the fact you have to buy the additional toppers takes another half star (I'm not mad about buying cars thats fine I suppose)
1;Wasted almost 800 hours of my life on this game!..... Sometimes I want them back but then I realize that I'm going to probably blow another 800 hours on it.... Joking aside probably one of the best and most satisfying 5 minute games EVER! Great for people like me who only have a few free minutes at a time. Wish there were more games you can play in short bursts that were as satisfying. Flying goals always make your day better!
1;I can't find anything wrong with this game. It's the perfect game. I don't know what else to say.Tons of people still play it even though the hype is gone. At first I thought it was really dumb. Split Screen co op works great car customization is fun I have nothing bad to say. The community is pretty good too.
1;Product received for free. great game to enjoy. love the physics and how fun it can be at times. the game is solid but has issues.PROS very fun with friends good soundtrack very satisfying at points great competition CONS customization could be better no way to get keys unless you buy them NPC's are dumb as a rockOverall it is not a bad game and is actually good but it needs just a slight few improvements and it could be a great game. 9/10 rate.
1;Good gosh darnit. This game is the bee's knees. The bird's turds. The ant's pants. The cat's hats.11/10 would buy again. Actually I did buy this on Ps4 and got it for a Steam friend.Those buttery aerials and the feeling of passing the ball to yourself for the ultimate top dog play. Better than a double D escort in a luxury suite with complimentary breakfast my dude.
1;This game is incredibly fun to just pick up and play but has the depth to keep you coming back for hunderds and even thousands of hours. On top of that the community is great and the developers are constantly listening to feedback and working to improve.Whether you're looking for a fun couch party game or something that will take you thousands of hours to master it's really hard ot not recommend this game.
1;"""Totally addictive I think this is one of the best games ever made! Its the only """"sports"""" game I have ever enjoyed I even watch the online RLCS to see the pro's play. The single player offline AI is good and you can spend all your time in this mode the online games are great and the DLC is cheap and feeds the addiction. Jump in for 5 minutes and find an hour or so has gone by You have been warned )"""
1;What's great about this game is that you can play in short bursts or have an hours long session thanks to its 5 minute matches. You can customize your car with free items obtained randomly or buy keys to unlock your crates and hope for an exotic item to show off in your next play. The game is simple to pick up but hard to master. Every few months there is an new update which includes new cars/new items and new free maps to play. The game never fails to surprise.
1;"""Reccomended.The game is fun pretty addictive and challenging. Game mechanics are initially pretty easy to pick up but difficult to master. With the new item trading system it also is much more """"inviting"""" to play as there's a feeling of progression.I was reluctant to buy it at first but I'm glad I did. Very fun especially with friends."""
1;You know how you occasionally see a footy match going on and the fans are losing their heads over in the stands? And you never quite understood how someone could get THAT into a footy match?Well that's me now. And needless to say my neighbors aren't happy. Seriously this is the only game I yell at. In either tears of joy or sobs of disbelief. WHAT A SAVE!!! WHAT A SAVE!!! WHAT A SAVE!!!
1;This game is amazing and here are a couple of facts why 1.Cars2.Ball3.Car and a Ball4.Car pushes the ball5.i loseput 4 real this game is epic and i think u guys should give it a try with ur bud or woth a stranger and +i recommend a controller couse it alot easier!
1;Great game to play with friends. Would recommend to anyone that has friends. Would not recommend to people without friends. In other words this game derives much of its value from social interactions and while it is possible to play in a bubble like many online multiplayer games you lose most of what you pay for when you do this. If you and a group of friends are looking for something to play for a couple hours a week together this is the game for you.
1;Fast paced. Easy to pick up very tough to master. Can be casual or very competitive and the games aren't long so you can jump on and play a few if you do not have much time. New in game items and modes get added every season. One of my favorite games of all time.10/10
1;100% worth buying this game. I have a few friends who also purchased this game and it's great just to jump into and make some mlg plays. The game is constantly being updated and every couple of months there's new content to delve into. The online matchmaking is consistant and balanced the DLC is unique and worth the money. I play on controller and the support for it is excellent considering it's PC. Definitely recommend!
1;Could be a really good game if they fix ALL bug's the first 2 days there was no on line match's server's was not working now i have had random game crash's in game and failed to load the game a few times ! PLZ its really good fun when it works it just needs to work more !
1;hi recently i won a hat in game and it doesnt really show it off in game the hat just dissapears in game i dont know the name but its a litle purple creature with a laser gun in the hand the rest is amazing. love the new rumble gamemode it's so fun thanks for providing me this fun )
1;Product received for free. I purchased this game after playing it one time. Best decision I made.I used to be a very big FIFA fan and overall a soccer enthusiast that loves physics. This game merged those two passions in one epic package.I only regret not playing ranked earlier since I would have learned to aerial earlier in my game.
1;Although it says i only have a few hours on this game it's because i just switched from ps4(about 350 hrs total) to pc (totally worth it) i basically have to say that this game is an incredibly fun and addictive game with an insane skill ceiling and that's what makes it so damn fun is the challenge. 10/10
1;Really great game! But... have to be honest.. its frusterating! 1/10 time you get a decent team where someone will play defense when they're put in that positin but 90% of the time it's an elementary school soccer game and theres just a huge group of people chasing the ball in a chaotic ball / Error 71 is a too
1;This game is really fun! In case you don't know it's soccer in rocket powered cars (football if you're not American)! I've been having a lot of fun with this game with my friends recently. Hopefully they'll add some more game modes or level types but even if they don't it's still been well worth the $20 spent!
1;Fantastic game would thoroughly recommend. Not only can you kick back into a casual game of football soccar but you can also try a competitive competition too for those who are.... competitive! My only complaint is that sometimes I find that the matchmaking (only sometimes) can be unfair. I might be put up againts 2 Legends on one team and I'm only a pro / semi pro but other than that there are no issues or complaints. )
1;Hands down this is the best college game. Whether you have 5 hours before your next class or even 12 minutes I will whip out my laptop just to get in a game or two. This is by far my favorite game and I've put in over 300 hours already. It's a must have game if you just want to shoot the bull with friends for a little while or if you're looking to go pro this is the game for you!
1;A beautiful baby between cars airplanes and a toxic community.Single Player 4/10Multi Player 6/10Microtransactions 10/10Overall game 10/10Overall score 7.5/10If you'd like a full in depth review check out my YouTube video for my thoughts https //youtu.be/JpaZj0ud7ag
1;I wouldn't normally focus on an online multiplayer for fun but this game is pure perfection! Not the youngest guy online but this game rewards those who take the time to learn the nuances. And every now and then a whole other layer of possibilities open up. Even when not winning playing this is a wonderful experience.
1;Was good until the newest update. For example the matchmaking sucks I'm a Veteran and the game matches me up with a master (always) in 1v1 in competitive mode. Before the update it matched me up with another veteran. Also make the hoops court slightly wider and longer it's very frustrating to play.
1;I believe I can fly... Might take till rocketeer but F$%$ it i'll try.Wanna wiff balls have a blast ramming people making people rage? Enjoy a positive community with a lot to learn and a enjoyable time doing it.No grinding or buying your way to win!Play with your friends or solo this game rocks!.... ahem I'll see myself
1;Even though luck sometimes plays a big part of the game its not an excuse for a lost game... If you are good enough you can win even if your enemy is insanely lucky. I bought this game in the first week of relase and fell in love with it.. Not just because i love football but because it combines good coop with skill based gameplay. Buy it with your friends and I promise as a casual gamer that you will enjoy the out of it
1;Great game.The game is very skill based even though sounding like a silly concept. Community is pretty helpful you can find guides to help you become better at the game pretty quickly. If you buy this game don't expect to be hitting aerials quickly I have all this time on here and I still miss the occasional shot.9/10Hope this helps you. Have a nice day.
1;Yeah..I do recommend this game. Its pretty good. No really Its good. The game play is simple addicting and just full out fun. Even though it simple its just about perfect. I mean its just right on point! This is the reason freeweekends exist. To enjoy the wonders of the steam library!
1;Did you spend your childhood being torn between playing soccer and RC cars? Are you shy to do this now because you are 30 and to fat to run on the field and just look creepy with a remote control toy? Worry no more and rejoice because this game brings your passions together while still deriving the benefits of your chair/couch and internet privacy.One Grumpy Russian score 11 out of 10 vodka this is da stuffFor more reviews join http //steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/
1;"""Rocket League is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. I originally got it for free on PS Plus when it first came out and instantly put over 100 or so hours into it. Rocket League is the very definition of """"easy to learn hard to master"""". The game takes about 10 or so minutes to really learn the controls but there is so much more to learn. The game constantly revolves around skill and pure luck. The community is very active and for only $20 this game is an absolute steal!"""
1;geat game fun to play solo even more fun with friends deffinetly worth the money 10/10. this game grips you with its fast past action soccer in order to win you must devise stratergies while incorperating all of your skill (ariels flips jumps etc) to get the perfect shot into goals.
1;Easily the best purchase that I have made on Steam in recent memory. It's like FIFA and MarioKart had an amazing lovechild. It manages to be super approachable as a newbie while having one of the highest skill ceilings that I have seen in a game (I'm 176 hours in and I am just to the point where I am starting to be comfortable even trying aerial shots).10/10 con't recommend this game enough. All I can say Wow!Wow!Nice shot!
1;Please Fix an error i have from the new update season 4 i got my wheels but i cant play online it doesnt show any servers and it just saying select a playlist but thier isnt any playlists thier please help if u can message me becuase i need this for my youtube its my job ive look for solutions but i cant find 1
1;I can't recommend this game enough. Psyonix always add new features and maps free dlcs and premium dlcs to keep you interested. There is so much customisation you can really make your car personal to you. This game never gets old however much you play. It is a must buy.
1;One of the best games out there for all kind of gamers! Young and old ages The competitive Sport gamers Team player Casual gamer and MOREGreat game that is constantly updated with crazy new items and etc. being added to the game.Rocket league may be known for its main theme of Cars &amp Soccer. But that isnt all there is. Many other game modes for example Basketball Hockey and others.
1;I think it's a pretty awesome game. The second season most the raknked people have to regain thier previous tier but the matchmaking is actually pretty good in ranked play. Really fun with friends but if you want to play more seriously you need a controller.
1;If you're gonna be like me and wast 51 actual days of your life on a game make it this one. Maybe we'll run in to each other and I'll probably call you names and tell you to die. Don't take it personally I wanna die more than anything after 51 days of this game so it's a compliment in my eyes
1;"Great game much more to it than meets the eye. At first it seems like a stupid concept but as you play it more develop strats play with friends practice and rank up you soon you don't wana stop XD. Also for good manner if anyone besides you owngoals then spam ""Nice shot!"" in chat. 10/10 would arieal dribble again."
1;"""To the 14 people who do not own this game already buy it. If it is not on sale buy it anyway. This game is well worth the full price. If you are only ever able to devote a few minutes at a time to a game this game is perfect. The matchmaking is sketchy and most people are the """"hit the ball if possible even if it's the wrong way"""" types but it's still fun and addictive."""
1;&gt Buy game&gt Start playing&gt Don't know what I'm doing&gt Miss 98% of the shots&gt After 250 hours of playing time still suck&gt Goes on Rocket League sub reddit&gt Tons of freestyle and air dribble goals&gt Realize you will never score goals like them&gt Gives up pro career&gt Never wanted to pay with Kronovi anyway11/10 would play this game foreverNice shot!
1;This is my favorite game. Look at my hours played. The premise sounds silly but executes flawlessly. Rocket League has a high skill cap and you only get better over time. However that doesn't mean the game isn't endlessly fun at whatever level of play you are. Pick it up if you're on the fence it's worth even the full price if you can't catch it on sale(which it always seems to be)
1;VERY ING TIRED of ending up in ranked 1v3 and 2v3 matches CONSTANTLY!!!!!!THANKS TO THIS T I CANNOT GET ABOVE OR EVEN KEEP ING BRONZE. This just ing hurts to end up in ed up matches over and over and over and over and over GOD DAMMNIT IM SO ......So yeah thats what you can expect from the online 'season pvp' playIf you have friends in real life this is probably a really fun game....6/10Would scream at noobs again
1;this game. I find myself constantly questioning how half the in this game happens which is both fun and a huge off. This game has the ability to bring out a rage that has not been seen since LoL and frankly thats a bad thing. TL DR games fun but rage inducing.
1;Ever since the automated ban system you cannot under any circumstances say any of the listed 20 words unless you want a progressively higher ban. (24 hr &gt 72hr)Good game sometimes hard to learn Controller reccomended Toxic parts of community can be easily banned (also chat and voice mute)No official Market/Prices be careful what you tradeWorth the 20$
1;A really great game! If you need a game that gets updated a lot this is a game to pick. My friend had one bad thing everytime there is a goal or a explosion his computer crashes but that's his problem. But really great game ot get if you have bad graphics it still runs fine. I don't know about the people that got this game with bad graphics cause I got this from a bundle so I don't think I got this game free lol.
1;I absolouty love rocket league. Great and amazing game. But i hate the ranking system online. Its kinda stupid and can take so many wins just to level up a division. I onces had to have 20 wins just to go to the next rank (silv2 silv3) i was kinda off by that. If rocket league can fix this I would be so happy.
1;Game is pretty fun and one of the few that I play nowadays. It can get very competive at times also. One major issue are the servers though! Sometimes it's hard to find a match (Not because people aren't playing there are just server issues) and ping can be quite high. Anyways I recommend the game to all! Especially if you have some friends to play with.
1;This is a very fun game that provides a new meaning to soccer and many other modes. This game provides a variety of modes whether soccer basketball or hockey or new rumble or mutated games. This provides tremendous variety and makes the game a very good game to play and I highly reccomend it.
1;This game is extremely fun to play but miserable at first since it has a lot of mechanics to master before you really get good at it. Only with 150 hours I can say it's one of the best multiplayer games out there. Also one of the best e sports game in my opinion. Definetly reccomending it!
1;This game is very addictive and nerve wreking. Nerves all ed up.. Beware... Especially online. It seems as if moving my body will get me closer to the ball.. I try and I try but I still manage to flip to far or to short. Either way its a head busser!!!
1;The Skill Ceiling in this Game is so unbelievably high that it even might turn off and drive away New Players. BUT the Training Modes are very good and the Bots can be very challenging. This rewarding Feel after Hours and Hours when you finally start hitting the Ball and then (if you have the Skill) it even continues to fly in the Direction you intended...10/10 would recommend!
1;I realized just now that i still haven't made a review for this wonderful thing. I've never had a game make me so anxious calm elated deflated and hyped all in just a 5 minute session. Truly the best sports game I have ever played and one of the best games bar none.
1;This is one of my favourite games of all time and played on almost every couch coop evening. Haters gonna hate but if you are one of us you just wont get enough of those sweet air shots. Newbies are welcome they learn fast if they are into it. Also the price tag is awesome. Get ready to get crushed online though.
1;This game is funny stressful and above all it recks your relationship with your friends ( in a good way) it destroyes it and then you build it back up ten fold. It can be dificult to get a good network to play on but there is a singleplayer mode where you fight bots. I reccomed this game to anyone with a strong internet connection and has time on theyr hands.
1;This game is a great filler. The matches are quick the physics are fun and the game play is intense. I enjoy the competitive mode even tho they just reset the ranks (UGH!!!). The graphics are great the car customization is fun to play with the DLC is affordable and fun. It's a great game if you play casually or competitively good for any level of player.
1;&lt really it went on sale when i just bought it yesterday i want my 1$ back JK...Anyway the game is fun...some of the arena distract you by their designI think this game better playing with friends than being alone doing samething all over again by urself will bored you out.
1;This game used to be one of my favourite games and then it fell off for me. Recently with the addition of crates my interest has resparked and I am only addicted to the crates the game. I'm only playing it because you cannot buy crates only earn them or beg others to trade them to you. The graphics are 10/10. My luck is 0/10. Gameplay about a 8/10.
1;"""I like this game because it""""s very fun to drive cars to score goals but in other hand if you don""""t have a controller gameplay will be very hard to play with keyboard.I recomend this game for all people who wants to play Rocket League .See you next time bye bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
1;Super balanced easy to pick up game. Not frustrating. Enjoyable win or lose. Only complaint is there is no punishment for quitting so salty kids constantly rage quit so if you queue up alone you will constantly get put in games where your team is losing. That is super annoying but that is the only thing wrong with the game. That and they need to make PC/PS4 party forming still.
1;Awesome game easy to pick up but hard to master. The crates are a fun addition and don't really impact gameplay besides pure cosmetic aspects. The e sports is pretty cool to watch and overall is a pretty nice game. Only trouble I have may be the sometimes toxic teamates but those are usually far and few.
1;This is the only game I play every day for an hour or two. It's just the best for that kind of gaming. No you won't get as good as the others with +/ 500hrs hours played that way but it's just so easy to either have few matches or get stuck for hours... depends mostly on how you're doing at the moment.
1;To be honest. You have all heard of Rocket League by now. My friend a while back convinced me to buy this. I did. And I fell in love. The developers of this game are amazing. Free content updates New game modes. New maps. One thing I never understood though is why did people get at crates? Its all cosmetic. You dont have to buy it. Get over it. But all in all I would for sure recommend this game!
1;It's been 2 days and I have 17 hours. I've stayed up until 7 in the morning playing this.Goodbye real life.Rocket League is a sports game where you and up to 3 others play a game of well meaning soccer in supersonic rocket powered acrobatic battle cars. Yeah we don't know why it's so good either. Pros Decent communityGreat GameplayFLYING GOALSChat spamOptimised Cons Neo TokyoSalty fuccbois9/10
1;This is a good all around party game. It is fun offers challenging game play easy to link up with friends on and off Steam and you get to customize your cars. I haven't played it much yet but in the 2 hours I did I feel I can say it is worth getting. cats/10
1;I actually really like the game I love the cars i like how the added crates and all the new itemsbut 1 thing that bothers me SO much with THIS game Is that Rocket League Doasn't know/kan make matches for you.What i mean is i'm lvl 28 proAnd i end up losing alot of matches because they put me with freaking veterans and expertsAnd thats not fun at all PLZ fix it
1;The most bipolar game ever but i still love it. this games is an easy 10/10 i recon. graphics gameplay and sound track all on point. Community is really good you do get some toxic people every now and then but you get that in every game but on the flip side Ive met some people who ive been teaming with for over a year. all in all for a game thats 20odd bucks its a steal id pay more for it easy.
1;Rocket League is an amazing game it is amazing for those who want to learn how to play soccer although it is not the same movement of soccer you hit the ball and try to score. In the settings I would like the option of turning off rain as I lag very much when i play any map with rain. Thanks DonkeyHoudini
1;This game is just... Awesome. Fly through the air (once you get good enough) and make great saves that you and your friends can gawk at for hours. There is even hockey or basketball if you get tired of the regular soccer part of the game. Overall I really recommend this game as it is very fun with friends and even by yourself. D
1;I recommend this game all the way its a very cool game now you may think its a crate simulator but its not you can get items just from playing and then selling them for items tha u get from crates and also there are events where you get some free crate a little problem whit this game are the server issues other than that this game is very cool Recommended )
1;I reached level expert recently but still get demolished every now and then by others. There's lots of things to learn but the way the game is set up allows new players to have beginners (ability to do basically druken boxing but rocket soccer style and confuse veteran players) luck and still have fun.
1;Product received for free. This game is a lot of fun. But you cant play it as well on a keyboard as on a controller. I recommend playing it on a controller. Im myself playing it on a keyboard and i can see and feel the difference. All in all the game is very good ).
1;i've been playing this game lately+installed rocket league+won a match+lost a match+lost again+decided to take a break and went out for a ride+crashed my car+waiting my car to respawn+my car did not respawn+my dad almost killed me10/10 would crash my little car again
1;This game is as simple as u can get it hit a big ball into a goal with a car. The basics are simple but mastering all the flying and team play isn't. This game is so easy to just fire up and do a few games if you don't have the time to play a long game.11/10 by far my favorite game produced
1;When Bruce accidentally hitted Jack in the head! he felt awfully bad. Which allow Jack to spend a little quality time with his spiritual being Bruce. an honour to evolute into be more tough and strong humble as a legendare soccer striker. Bruce has by far the best skill WITH LOVE URINE TROUBLE IF YOU DON'T TAKE SHOTS Gayne Wretski
1;It sounds stupid but is just so much fun. Most fun I had in any game for a while.It's easy to get into but super hard to master. If you like getting personally better at something and playing a game where skill matters this one is for you.It's also nice that rounds are only about five minutes so you aren't bound to the game by prolonged periods of time. At least in theory (in practice I play this all the time). )
1;Be prepared for the ultimate learning curve. Your team will usually consist of people who have no idea how to hit the ball and the opponents have a guaranteed 600+hours put into beating the crap out of Rookies. Ranked and unranked are virtually the same considering your teammates will always be awful.9/10 will continue to play regularly.
1;Highly recommended game. The learning curve is so smooth and enjoyable on all parts. You start off barely able to hit the ball and progressively work your way to flying through the air to land a ball. For anyone who wants to become an advanced player there are metagame tactics involved but these don't become necessary until you've mastered all the basics. Overall a great game for casual and competitive play.
1;Product received for free. The seemingly unreachable skill ceiling makes this one of the most rewarding games I've ever played.You'll want to have a few friends because around 100 hrs or so into playing you'll start to require teamwork to succeed more.
1;Well the time has come.... i have 1000ish hours in this game have played across ps4 and pc and just want to thank the devs for creating such an amazing game this is by far my favoirte game i have ever played if you havent played it just give it a shot its amazing!
1;This is the best game I have played all year. Its like nothing I've ever played before and I would (and have) recommended this game to anyone. If you're still on the fence about this game believe me you will not regret it.Best $19.99 I have ever spent. 10/10(Also the Supersonic Fury DLC Pack was DEFINITELY worth it and I would buy it again if I could!)See you in a match!
1;I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! ITS SOO WORTH THE 20 DOLLARS!!!!! This game is a lot of fun and when you have friends playing this game with you its even more fun. Plus come on driving super fast cars to hit a huge ball in a big goal where there is only 5 minutes to win??? The big goal sounds easy to score on but really its not. I have missed to many chances to score easy goals.
1;How can you not love this game? The game itself looks amazing with the detail to every little graphic awesome soundtrack and five minute games make it so the game is not overwhelming time consuming. Whether you are a hardcore gamer or a recreational one I think everyone will enjoy this game.
1;I've been playing Rocket League since launch and the experience has since never dulled. Few games pump the adrenaline at such an intense rate and Rocket League does so with zero diminishing return. I'm appalled at how the developers have kept gameplay fresh with so many variations and the title has left a plethora of unforgettable memes in it's wake.10/10 will play again... Just one more... Just one more..
1;"""It's been a long time since i've played a game that's kept me coming back night after night.""""Easy to learn hard to master"""" describes this game well.Making an impossible shot or mounting a huge comeback are very rewarding experiences in this game.The hook to this game is that you feel like you are getting better all the time."""
1;Best sports game on the market. This game will have you cursing your friends and enemies alike. It may not look like much but it is incredibly hard to master but very easy to play even if you cant ever master the complexities of the game like some of the crazy flying the pros do. Pick it up its well worth the $20 bucks.
1;565 hours on record and I still try to find the time to play it every night. The skill ceiling is so high there is always room for improvement and the satisfaction of pulling off more difficult moves keeps the drive going. Psyonix is also very responsive to player feedback. A+
1;Do you like football? Do you like cars? Well it doesn't matter because this is something of it's own... league? Anyways great game loads of fun especially with friends so get a friend or two lay back and score goals that you don't even know how you did it!
1;I think this game is amazing it has provided much playability for me. I think it is tough but it lets you play with bots to train. I have not done much with competitive mode but that doesn't mean I can't have fun. Rocket League is my third most played game on Steam and one of the things that beats it is a clicker game which I let run overnight. I think this game is very much worth $15 especially with new updates coming every month.
1;THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! It is much faster on the pc version though. I have a mac that hase osx and windows 10 and when I go to windows 10 it is much faster than osx. So if you have a mac that dosen't meet the minimum requirements don't get it. I have almost all the minimum requirements and it still does not run very fast. So just be carefull.
1;if you can get past the player base being a bunch of squeeker kids(or the same in quasi adult bodies) its fun.Suggest first move is mute everyone... consistently irritating people.Aside form that great game.EDIT Changed to negative due to total lack of action on community managment. Reporting chat names and avatars promoting neo nazism serial killers rapists and other such bile is ignored. This game is itching for a lawsuit.
1;Pros Chaos but not that muchCons Sometimes you don't hit the ball but that's fine life is like that. Once i was in this match 5x5 the scoreboard 3 seconds left me the ball the goal and a double jump to win the game. I jumped put the joystick foward and a flying car smashes me and i explode into a million pieces. The game ends 9x3.12/10
1;Who knew a soccer car game would be so addictive? Easy to play difficult to master. How many other cliched proverb can I chuck in?Great for people who want fun quickly and for those who play games online and at home with family and friends. It's also very fun collecting different things for your car.I like it
1;Product received for free. Got RL for free with the steam controller preorder. Even if I had to pay for it it's been one of the best games I've ever played definitely worth the $20. They update constantly and you can either play a few matches for 30 mins or binge it for a day straight. Once you get the controls down it's fantastic and highly replayable. A bit frustrating at first when you're getting wrecked by people who know what they're doing and are scoring air goals. Great game!
1;Fantastic game! After putting over 700 hours into this game I have to say that this is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. It can definitely get frustrating at times but pressing and playing over and over without giving up is the key to getting better!
1;"""Don't hang on the fence here worth a buy. Enormously high skill ceiling awesome fun great community and it's even better with friends. To top it all off the games are five minutes long no need to sit there and get railed for 30 minutes plus like in CS. It's also waaay less frustrating than CS and has become my primary competitive multiplayer game.Just do it you won't regret it. Soon enough you'll be saying """"just one more game..."""""""
1;My 'go to' whenever I have a bit of spare time. Playing some split screen through Nvidea surround is also something worth trying out! (Spread surround over two screens and enable vertical splitscreen). Nothing wrong at all glad to see that the developers are still working on new features!
1;I used to love this game but man the community is cancer.I recommend the game but the community and psyonix for not even taking any actions against the toxic cancerous players.LOOK HOW MANY HOURS DO I HAVE YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT? NOW I'M NOT HAVING FUN OF IT CUZ THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR.
1;I've played this game over and over and to be fair it won't be for everyone. To me however it is this generations Smash Bros equivalent. Great fun with friends just tooling around online AND it has quite a good learning curve / deep skill set IF you want to take it seriously. 10/10.
1;I have played this game on both the PS4 and PC quite a lot. I'm not the best player but I always have fun. The game is easy to learn and hard to master. I have definitely not mastered it yet. I have however enjoyed probably 600+ hours in this game. Considering I got it for free on the PS4 it is an incredible return on my investment. Because I loved a game that I got for free so much I've now bought it several times for friends on both PC and PS4. I can not recommend this game enough.
1;Rocket League is the most fun game I have ever played. Also I personally feel that the DLC is well priced. However the seems to have been a problem for a few months now that still has yet to be fixed. This issues has made competitive unplayable for me as the competitive servers are worse than the ones for casual. The gameplay is great though but the servers need to be addressed ASAP.
1;This game is amazing it's really fun and it's really addictive to play. Not that you can't stop playing but it's hard to put down. I only have a 1000 hours on this but it is by far the best game I have ever played on any of the accounts I have. thank you so much for whomever came up with this game please don't stop coming up with ideas I will probably never stop playing this game!
1;Bought the 4 pack for me and the three friends I usually play with and man do I not regret this purchase. I have often thought its the simplest games that make the most fun and this one is a perfect example. Who would've thought playing soccer with cars would be this much fun. You know you wanna buy it so go ahead and support these devs. They deserve it!
1;Hi so Rocket League is a game that gets you addicted very quickly! It's a hell lot of fun to play when you get the first hang on it. At first glance I thought this game is very one sided but one quickly realizes that it's deeper then it looks. I played almost 200 hours now and im still learning so much things 'bout the game.Also I like the queueing system it's quick and easy! THANK YOU!10/10 would play again! Must buy I think!
1;"""As my first game to review I chose Rocket League. I have not much to say about it because its f****** awesome DAerials with custom made cars what do you need more in life. Sick to play in multiplayerEdit """"aerials"""" are not easy autogoal machines10/10 would score autogals again"""
1;I never understood how people yelled at sports before playing this game. I now yell at this game like people yell at sports. Except I'm yelling at myself for missing the ball. While it's incredibly frustrating at times those times you do make epic shots makes all the rage worthwhile.
1;I can't fault this game. Fast paced 5 mins of action every game. A very addictive game hard to put down once you start. I would suggest this game to anyone who loves single player fun and multiplayer action amongst friends. It's a MUST to get for your game collection.
1;great game BUT it's a little lame that there is a 15 minute ban. my game closed out and went to desktop a few times maybe 3 in a day. I cannot open the game back up from desktop without closing it. To fix this I need to run the game in windowed mode but yeah the 15 minute ban is pretty lame. otherwise the game is fun as .
1;"""This is that game where you ask yourself """"Why didn't I discover this game sooner?!""""I know you heard the hype you saw videos online or something. But until you play it...Then you make your best friends buy it and you have a twos or threes team for life."""
1;At first its just fun to chase around the ball. Then somebody flies over your head and blows your mind. Hundreds of hours later now you're the one blowing people's minds.Only downside is lack of population on certain servers at some times of the day but that's the community's fault really.
1;Legit this game is one of the best games on the market today! I've been playing for almost a year now and have enjoyed it ever since. You rarley get bored when playing this game at the beginning it is very challenging and after you start playing for a while it gets really easy and fun to hit arieals and other amazing shots in the game! Still one of the best games ever
1;Bought this game shortly after release for a fun split screen experience with firends. Origionaly thought $20 was a bit steep for the lack of content but it is one of my most played games and worth every penny. Only problem I've have with it is the addition of a CS GO like case and key system. There is currently no way to get rid of the cases in my inventory without using keys that I am never going to buy.8/10 Fun online Better with friends.
1;"""excellent game but the cross platform play means you cant see on steam who your recent players are... bit unhelpfull espically if you find that one good player amongst many many many terrible """"high Level Veteran/Experts"""" who play like rookies. all said and done this game is well worth it with epic dlc (so far each month) free maps music and general updates cars are worth paying for considering that each has a slight difference in handling and how they feel.all i can say is GET IT"""
1;Very fun and easy to play There's a ton of modifiers and game modes to keep things interesting for people just looking to have some fun but also has competitive modes with a surprisingly high skill cap if you're looking for a challenge.I can't get enough of Rocket League.
1;SA SERVERS!!No more EU servers I can actually see what I'm doing now You need this in your life get it now! It's rocket fueled cars playing football need I say more.Great fun with friends.Community not too toxic some great guys out there.Controller highly recommended.Give it time you will improve and get better.
1;This game is just amazing it is a really cool game to play with some friend. It is a game easy to play and hard to master so even if you dont play often you can have fun too and on the other side if you want to play more competition there is always new tricks to learn. a good game that i recommend
1;I Think rocket league is a simple easy to play game its probably the cheapist game out there that u can have a lot of fun with on steam theres a bunch cool stuff in this game which is a lot of fun especially with friends the only thing i dont like about this game is u get crates for playing but u need to buy keys for money like cod points for supply drops but one thing they can do to make this game better is make it so every 10 games u get 5 keys otherwise this game is worth ur money
1;I bought it played it and loved it for the price you get what you pay for!A lots of fun and rage but if you got friends to play with it's even more fun.The game worth the penny.I bought most of the DLC to contribute to the dev and because I like to have some extra body to choose from in the game.No regret at all!!!
1;This game is AMAZINGLY Fun. When you play with friends it takes it to another level. This is the only time I like playing soccer is when I play this game. What I really want in this game is like some type of racing involved. Such as races time trails competitive racing.
1;"""The game is fantastic. For something as simple as """"soccer for cars"""" there is certainly a lot to master. The only down side here lately has been the amount of """"smurfing"""" that happens with competetive play. It's great to pick up a match quickly if you have a short amount of time to play a game."""
1;Thought this would just be a casual soccer game... neck minute.I've bought a controller for more precise aerials upgraded to an ultrawide screen to get a better refresh rate and a wider field of view.Hundres of keys later and all the DLCs I've got absolutely no regrets I cannot get enough of this game.and now I'm even looking at buying some merch....Rocket League isn't a game it's a way of life.
1;I usually don't like sport games but i love rocket league. The main difference is that in rocket league you don't just press a button to pass and another to shoot on goal in RL you have to drive or jump into the ball at a specific angle to get the result you want every shot is different and as a result every goal is exciting. The devs are also doing a good job of continuously improving the game. There are some issues with bad servers but most of the time it works just fine.
1;I bought this game pretty soon after it was available and still play it almost daily. It is one of those easy to learn hard to master type of games. The ability to join games in matter of seconds and the short format of the matches makes this the ideal game to play those short moments you have available.
1;this game will never get old! always adding new and exciting content which keeps the game feeling fresh! sometimes matchmaking may be bad but rocket league has many other qualitys that make up for it! i would reccomend this game as it is extremly fun! and playing with friends can make for some hilarious moments!
1;At the end of 2017 Rocket League remains one of my favorite games in my library. It was definitely my multiplayer GOTY when it came out in 2015. Games are fast intense and very fun. This game is easy to play but very hard to master. Psyonix the developer has been fantastic in their support of this game. Hours and hours of competitive fun!
1;A Multiplayer Blast! There are countless hours of fun to be had with rocket league. Rocket leagues fast paced football frenzy is defiantly worth picking up for just over ten pounds. There are plenty of awesome cars to choose from and decals to customise them with. The maps are stunning and the game modes are incredible. This game gets updated regularly with new content each time making you want to come back for more! 9/10
1;Soccer with cars? Absolutely! the graphics are great. the physics are fine tuned. the community can be childish but chat is easily customized or disabled in settings. Best of all it's not like other pay to win games. you won't be buying any special powers that make you faster or more powerful. Skill and practice is all that's required.
1;It's very fun. The game is able to be played for 100s of hours without loosing its playability. The ability to customize your car from drops you get in game or from crates adds a whole other aspect to this game by ways of trading and striving for the best gear.
1;Product received for free. When my friend first showed me this game i thought it looked stupid and dumb. He ended up buying it for me so i'd have to play with him and i've never put so many hours into a game! this game is full of fun and laughter. (with a tad (lot) bit of salt) The experience is still fun regardless if you're good or bad
1;This game will never get old. Ever. I Reccomend this game if you like having your bunghole clinched for a good 5 min. Although I do not reccomend this game if you get angry. I do not get angry at ANY videogames because i just play them for fun but this one I get ING AT. But hey buy it.
1;This game is awesome this game is fun I finally hit Gold 1In Doubles at 1.It took me long About 3 weeks + Now I'm staying strong Waiting for these servers To stop making a fuss And come back upYes you see the server are down And I'm not sure what to do So I sit here and frown Sitting here without you.SNARF!
1;This game is insanely addicting. I don't usually play sports games or multiplayer games but this one felt different to me. There have been some issues with matchmaking and server issues but my games have not been affected recently. All of the paid DLC is cosmetic and does not affect the game which is nice if you don't want to spend extra money after the initial purchase. I would recommend this game to everyone.
1;This game is so much difficult with my keyboard and mouth thus I got XBOX controller for this game.1st impression its amazing game that I've ever seen as soccer game.but its hard to play technically need skills and knowledge to expect where ball go.Anyway this game is not crap or something like you think. buy it.
1;This game is insanely funny. The controls will take you some time to learn but once you got them covered the crazy starts multiplying. I do feel the current price is a little high so you should pick it up on a sale which happens quite frequently.I also don't really like the DLC's but they are cosmetic only so it doesn't impact gameplay just another way for the devs to make a little money by adding a model.
1;Probably one of the most fun and adicting games I have EVER played buy it now and play with a controller you definitly won't regret it. No hackers nice servers a community that is not toxic overall this is perfect. I have 122 hours and i am not near getting bored of it.
1;Good but at times the game starts glitching and a red lightning thing turns up for the whole match leaving you stuck for the whole match this just happened to me 3 times in a row and so i forfeited each game then the game banned me from playing matches for 10 minutes because of me keep forfeiting which i think is ridiculous and disgraceful.
1;Easily one of the best multiplayer games ever made. I find myself coming back to this game more often then I realized. They could easily do a Tron Light Cycle Mod for this game which would be super cool as well. Or even Disc of Tron like that old stand up arcade game. Which was bad !! Anyways this game rocks plan and simple...
1;Well as the community grew and the fame of the game upheld I once again played the game. From my perspective now I DO like the game as of the FPS DOESN'T drop as much as the past version did from the further smoothing updates. So here is in my appreaciation to Rocket League creators Psyonix a good review NO ONE LISTEN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT DON'T GIVE GOOD RATINGS AND HAVE LOWER IN GAME HOURS!
1;I have spent around 400 hours in this game in quite short period of time. Truely amazing stuff great competetive challenge posibility to master controls with your wheels ranked matchmaking section. All I love about competetive games comes with Rocket League. Get it boys!!!!
1;A game that at first glance appears to be a simple title that offers a fun night with friends Rocket league is crazy fun and easy to control with many menuevering tricks to learn for advanced players. I told myself after playing it at a friends house one night that I would wait for it to go on sale but the next day all I wanted to do was play rocket league!
1;this game may be very odd looking and ridiculus but you have to experience the game before you judge it. this game is an amazing crossover of cars soccer and rockets that somehow is perfectly balanced and fun. its so fun its even fun when you lose. and to anyone who is unshure about this game i can assure it is well worth 20 dollars and i highly reccomend it.
1;HeyThis is my opnion on the game. Its a realyl fun game its really worth the money but if you dont have any mates playing it it can be boring.1. its a really funny game wort 20Euros defiently.2. It looks really good ingame and its just a awesome game overall
1;Unique with a steep learning curve. But entirely worth it! Trust me this game for what this game is it is perfect at it and there is no other. It has a strong esports vibe great attention by developers and just a perfect formula overall. If you enjoy racing games and soccer hockey basketball or even just the idea of the combination of those GET THIS GAME This is a modern day rite of passage and something I recommend that you try regardless of your specific taste in games.
1;What should i say. An amazing game that brings a lot of fun with it. It doens t matter if you play alone or with friends it s always fun. For me i must say i like to play it more with a friend than alone and this is one of the main keys of the game to play it as a team. But you can only say amazing game hours about this game and Nothing else .
1;If you like team oriented sports and a game that can be very enjoyable both competitively and casually this is a game for you. It's a lot of fun. At first I wasn't sure how to feel about it but after playing it for a few hours I found that I really loved it. Give it some time and it will grow on you.
1;Many people start describing their experiences with this game with them explaining that they thought the premise of playing football with cars seemed dumb. I remember looking for stuff like this on free online game sites. Then this game came along. I was immediately hooked. I wasnt able to convince my friends that this was a good game. I have new friends now they do like this game. Rocket League is fun. I reccomend.
1;I played this game for first time on my friend's account. Decided to make my first steam purchase for this. Annnnnnnd it is totally worth it. have been palying 3 4hrs a day never get bored of it. it feel different in every game even tho its same gameplay. Have been hooked to this game. Would recommend it to gamers trying something new.
1;Good fun game with lots of variety however since the patch on April 26th I've experienced my ping going up from its previously stable 30ms to regularly being in 200 250ms. Not good enough Rocket League when I'm almost a third of a second behind the game.
1;Top game singleplayer good luck trying to play online. The amount of rubberbanding / connection issues this game throws up just makes it unplayable online. When the devs sort the servers this game is a must buy!Edit 09.02.15 For server issues unplug your router for say 1 min plug back in seems problems are rted can confirm myself I've had no issues at all I also kept all my settings for router.Edit 26.03.15 Why have you not bought this yet ?
1;Rocket League is by far the most fun game I played in a long time. The developers did a gread job (and still do with constant updates). The pricing of DLC is fair the crates are well balanced and overall it's a perfect example of how to release maintain and market a game.
1;"""Pure fun. The game is crazy fast and doesn't pull down your computer at all. The physics in the game are so good that there is a massive learning curve. Matchmaking is almost instant and the games are only 5 6 minutes long.Get a few friends to play with you and your family will be begging you to be quiet. My friend told me about the game and I said """"so it's soccer with cars.""""It sounded pretty lame. I'm glad I trusted him!"""
1;I like Rocket League But there is a big issue concerning Lag spikes within the game due to the amount of RAM needed for this game... When you have 8GB the game laggs as hell.I replaced it with 16GB and now everything is fine again....This is a major issue for Rocket League which needs to be solved by the developers.
1;"""Well I held off on buying and playing and then a friend said """"play it! WITH ME!!!!"""" So I did then I won a few games then I made challenger in ranked. Then I just had this spiral of hookers and blow while playing rocket league. So much regret and abuse. . . . . Wait this is A.A. online meeting correct?You won't regert buying this game espcially if you're going to play with friends. See you punks! on the feild!"""
1;This is no doubt the best game I played on steam. When you start the game you like what can be so good in soccer with cars but when you play its like you must scream (recomend not to play in night so father wont come and hit you with his fist because you woke him up P).
1;Easy to get a hang of hard to master. Really good game physics are well made you can expect whatever happens (except some weird rare glitches).Definetely recommend this game.Recommend playing with a controller but you can manage with the Keyboard and mouse.
1;Probably the only game I've ever played that's caused me large amounts of stress frustration and rage quits but yet I still come back for more. Why?!Fantastic blend of physics and fun game mechanics. I would say the only thing to watch out for is the attitude of some opponents but if you ignore that and sink into the game it gets really fun really quick and oh so satisfying when you nail an arial corkscrew backflip goal from your half.
1;Great game but a few problems The ingame mic is crapThe ping goes up sometimes and goes right back downThe quick chat should have a feature where u can add ur own textsSometimes when ur internet gets cut off and u quit from a ranked match in bans from matchmaking for 30 minsThats it but anyways this game is great
1;I got play this game in the weekend when it was free I thought my pc could not run the game but it was very easy not hard to do at all my pc is that is why I thought I could not run Rocket League that is why I did not buy the game I will most likely buy the game since I know that my pc can run it .
1;This game is a really fun sports game and pretty much anyone can play it. I recommend using a controller but keyboard and mouse is also perfectly fine. I recommend this game alot by its quality and amount of things to do. The only reason this game really has a downside for me is that people are mean in the chat sometimes but just ignore them and if you like sports Rocket League is a smart choice.
1;Really simple game mechanics yet so intuitive and rewarding.What most I love about this game is how fast you're diving into the action you can find a match in seconds with each game mode. Gets really addictive once you get the hang of it I thought it was childish at first but after trying it out on the free weekend I found it competetive skillful and good ol' clean fun.Had lots of fun this weekend if you have any doubts about purchasing it it is worth the money.
1;Product received for free. A TRUE test of skill strategy and occasional chaos. A simple premise with rewarding gameplay. It can be frustrating exciting dramatic and sometimes intense. Scratches several itches if you love fast paced gameplay that rewards quick reactions savvy team play and skill based learning.9/10
1;its a good game all above but i have frame rate issuses with the aquarium map i think they should at least add a setting were you are able to choose which maps you would like to play in matchmaking on to solve the lower specks people from lossing a competitive match over framerate issuses
1;Super Fun game xD Awesome to play with Friends the cars are Awesome and its very cool when you get new stuff for the cars in the end of a game. at the begining i was not sure if the game was worth spending 20 bucks so i bougth it on promocion but now i know that for the the fun it gives and play with friends i would probably buy it for that price xD
1;Absolutely love this game. The best part about this game is that it has something to offer for every level of player and at each level there is so much left to uncover about it. It's deceptively simple yet contains within it layers and layers of complexity should you wish to uncover it. I'm absolutely addicted and hooked! Would recommend this anyday!
1;To start off this game is amazing i have put many hours into playing this game and still enjoy it. It is very easy to learn and is fun to play with or without friends you can either play casually or competitevly. The graphics are amazing and each car has the same stats so it would never be unfair. If your looking for a fun not so realistic game that will last you a long time then this is what you should get.
1;I get every friend who comes to my house to play this game and we always end up playing for hours. It is so much fun the devs are very responsive and the DLCs are a blast. I could play the hockey mode alone for days on end. I can't get enough of this game.
1;So i said i would try this game when it was free on ps4 and said it looked stupid why am i downloading this.... after putting 500 hours in on ps4 and 200 on pc i can tell you this game is life.... life.... life.... only play it if you like ing your pants or like that you know... but fr fr it's life...
1;this game has its ups as well as the downs. It's one of those games that its your accual skill as well as luck to be good and yes this game will make you shake the controller and yell at the screen and you will quit but you just keep comeing back to it and even if you dont like soccer (i dont i find it borring to watch) this game is much more you drive you hit a ball you make goals and you blow people up its simple10/10 great game.
1;After playing this game for a while I've realized that this is a very well created game an awesome gameplay mode and it's awesome to play it with friends also you can always make a quick game when you don't have time so that's awesome too.All I got to say is that this game was totally worth it and I fully recomend it.
1;I dont like football and i dont like cars......but i LOVE this xDToo bad theres too many csgo players though.Games usualy start with full teams but as soon as the other gets 1 or 2 goals in advance most games usualy turn into players vs bots. Now regarding the quiters and losers two words git gut.
1;Great fun to play especially with friends not particularly hard to pick up but quite hard to master and perfect. Still love playing this even after 600 hours of gameplay.Just have to be careful of the trolls and sometimes harsh/incensitive language but that's to be expected from games of this sort anyway.
1;This game has been the epicentre of my year of gaming in 2016.Since release this game has became a massive hit and it's understandable why.It has great community support refined and extremely responsive controls impressive artwork and level design free new content and most importantly it's so cheap!!!
1;One of the best games i have ever played insanely simple idea with brilliant execution if ever anyone wants to play a chill game this is up there. You could just pick it up play a game and put it back. Amazing game.... would recommend to anyone to get it if you can believe the most fun you'll ever have like legit I THE PRESIDENT OF THE USA approve this game
1;Let me start by saying if you put more than 50 hours into this game you'll probably put more than 300 into it. It is so much fun and highly addictive because there is always a new skill to learn and if there isn't there is always another game to play. I highly recommend this game because it is such a unique blend of traditional sports and racing genres that will keep you coming back for more.
1;Oh boy... this game.At first I wasn't sure if I were going to like this game and a friend of mine convinced me to buy it.One of the best decisions in my life.This game just rocks your whole world and everything beyond it.It's cool fast loads of fun and simple af. But once you get to learn all of the depth of this game it just becomes more and more awesome while you slowly start losing all of your friends even those who play this game because they suck.I rate solid 5/7.
1;Simply the best game I've ever played. It's easy to learn but there's always new things you can practice and perfect. There's always people better than you forcing you to work harder so you can eventually beat them. More fun to play than full price triple a games. Just buy it already!
1;This Game is totally addicting. I'm playing it more or less regularly since September 2015 and i love it till now. It has many new things coming in frequently updates what kepps the game interesting although it's played for almost 1k hours. It's also ragefilled because if something doesn't work out like you wanted it to it can get pretty annoying and gets you easily But although i came back playing it and all in all i had a very good and nice time playing it. I totally recommend it D
1;So much fun! Even if you're not into football or driving games I guarantee you will enjoy this. Only negative point I have is that there could be more single player modes possibly tournaments or challenges. Nonetheless brilliant game worth every penny.
1;This game is one of the funnest games I've ever played. Even though I am rubbish at it it is so addicting. You know a game is good when you enjoy watching others play on their broadcasts and get the same thrill as when you are playing yourself. 10/10!!!
1;Rule #1 Buy a 4 packRule #2 pass out copies to brosRule #3 Destroy the competetionThis is one of the best games out there period. Top of its genre by a million miles nothing really stacks up to this game. The skill cap is ridiculous and the replay value is infinite. I bout a 4 pack for 20 bucks when it came on sale. Totally worth so worth that I gladly buy the DLC cars to support the developer.
1;This one of the best games I have ever played. I highly recommend it to anyone. Even people that do not play many games would like Rocket League. I have never got bored when playing this game and I think it is well worth money. The developers are some of the best as they always release new content for free and none of the game has any sort of pay 2 win aspect. That automically puts it at the top of my list for game of the year
1;"""Bought it for twenty so basically full price. A phenomenon everlasting gaming legend already.Games are short so if you only have a few minutes you hop in for a quick game... and usually overstay your session by a lot . Then you just kind of forget you had to be """"in places"""" an hour ago. And then you do it again and again and again...RL is still getting content updates. And they're free. In 2018."""
1;"""Product received for free. I love this game but there are some things that should change but they are not because of developer they're because of the players who play this game. Too much toxicity too little compliments and """"I'm having fun!"""" players. Developers are doing great job giving us new stuff to obtain new maps and new game modes. I recommend this game because it really is fun to play this when you don't let the other players bring you down."""
1;THEY FIXED IT. Now only improve FPS on the maps that got fixed.Ruined by new maps. The frustration with it outweights the fun now. Ranked queue has experimental maps that ruins it's play and there is no way to disable it. The community is also immensly toxic and this is coming from a DotA2 player. Don't put time in this play it as a party game.
1;To put it simple this game is a blast. Whether playing solo or with friends you can have hours of fun. It takes a little bit(not too long) to get used to movement especially for mouse and keyboard users. Better if you use a controler. However after a few games you should have it down easily. I an honestly entertain hours of fun with this game. I strongly recommend buying this game. it is amazing.
1;This has to be one of the best games I've ever owned. Always keeps me coming back for more. No matter how long you've played there is always something to get better at! Just when you think it starts to get a bit stale a new mode is released! If only Omni didn't mis the ball so often...
1;"""good fun game in which you will think you will never be like the pros but when you spend enough time in it you will be ... sorta.. kinda. whatever just remember its fun game and being pro is not everything.* the game is always updated (mostly with the content that players ask for). * all of its maps are free.* many other good things which i don't have time to lista handful advice. don't get drifted in the glorious infinite loop of """"1 more game"""" D"""
1;Wikid combo of cars and soccer mixed in with mad flips and crazy aerials. At 5mins a game super fun and easy for the laid back casual and the hardcore gamers alike. Huge customizational options for you from what car you use to paint decals hats and antennas. A must have hundereds of hours of fun await.
1;Rocket League...What more can I say... After hours and hours playing the SARPBC after years the sequeal had arrived. What a brilliant idea executed so well. Simple beautiful and fun are the words I would use to describe this game. I rate this game very highly and have played the sh*t out of it. 10/10 for me!
1;i have not purchased this game for myself but have been using it through my friends library and its the best. I havent had this much fun in a game in a while now its super fast paced and exciting. I highly recommend getting this game if you are on the fence about it just do it its amazing.
1;This game is the best sports game in a long long time. It takes a special kind of sports game where you can only blame yourself for things going wrong. It's about as perfectly balanced as any game can be and the developers have wisely resisted the temptation to pay for any advantages so far. I own it on both console and PC as do my kids and although I'll never be an expert it'll go down as one of my favourite games of all time to play with them and by myself.
1;"""Great waste of time my favorite game. You can go on it for a 10 minute session or play it all day which is my favorite part of the game not being """"committed"""" to playing it for long at a time.I played SARPBC it is a semi worthy sequel to that as it lacks the original maps (utopia is no longer round stadium too ship and stuff is not there) and I can only hope that they will bring this in the future"""
1;Don't really know what they are doing with the game right now. I don't know what is up with the ranking system It's all over the place sometimes. When you play doubles sometimes it will be matched likes this (s2 g2 vs s2 g2) g Gold s Silver. It gets annoying when it gets matched up like this it can cause problems like for example toxicity and negative reactions. Other than that the game is pretty stable and fun to learn and play!
1;Simple but EXTREMELY addictive. There's a reason why there's a big competitive scene for this game. The game is very easy to pickup but extremely hard to master it. You may be able to achieve a few advanced tricks but it'll take a crazy amount of practice.
1;This game has brought me more joy than any other game in a very long time! For some reason I constantly find myself laughing my off while still fulfilling my competitive urge. So far the community has been very nice and have not run into any hackers (yet). I love the variety of customization of verhicles and all the different game types. Perfect game for killing 5 10 minutes or 5 10 hours. Highly recommend 5/5!
1;"""""""Just one more game...""""Easy to learnEnjoy playing for 5 minutes or 5 hoursEthical microtransactionsGreat to play with friendsFun at all skill levelsRuns great on older PCsI find myself going back to this game every night. It's very addicting and worth trying."""
1;This game is good but it is hard to play with a mouse and keyboard. I mean it is okay as long as the ball is on the ground but when it gets in the air it is very hard to hit if u are playing with a keyboard. So if u are planning to play ranked with a keyboard and u have about 20h into the game then u are problably gonna get stuck in bronze forever and even there it is hard to play but if u plan to play it casually it is a nice and relaxing game.
1;Not a big fan of competitive e sport games since I HATE what gaming has become. (A story for later) This game is just pure fun to play with friends for me. I stay away from the competitive side of it. Also it's money hungry with DLC and crates. If your like me and hate the triad of evil in gaming (DLC MIcro transactions E Sports) then avoid this one. Unless your ALSO like me and have friends to play with.
1;You really can't describe it till you've played. If you don't like sports you'll probably be put off by this game. If you love sports let's face it you're already playing this. I just encourage you to give it an hour of your life. You can thank me later!
1;A game that is easy to pick up but that allows you to become skilled if you play enough. It's a really fun format as matches last 5 minutes. If you're getting crushed and rage it's only gonna last 5 minutes ). The best thing about it for me is that it allows you to play multiplayer split screen. (ON PC? YES!) Best played with a controller in my opinion.
1;Do you like football ?NO !Do you like Cary racing ?Hell No !Well do you like rocket ?#uck jeah Thats all it is. Cars suck football sucks but rockets ? maaan rockets are freaking awsome.So if you like science space and match o god damniot this game is for you !!!
1;Sometimes I'm good sometimes I'm bad and for the occasional abuse you get from your team when you are getting mauled it's a wonderful pick up and play game. It's taken over from CS GO as my multiplayer favourite I don't even mind buying the DLC.Don't go watching YouTube videos of professionals as you will come away feeling very inadequate.
1;If you want to play this game competitively it's going to dissapoint you if your ping isn't absolutely perfect. When you have 75+ ping the game likes to dc you for a few seconds at a time at least once a game and it's enough to make you want to pull your hair out. Could be a really good game but the servers aren't good enough to warrant anything more than casual fun.
1;Literally soccer with rocket powered RC cars this game is completely addicting. The high intensity gameplay mixed with the mentally challenged teammates of online play come together to create this perfect game. This is one of those games where you can play for hours and not even realize it.Just... one... more... game...
1;Well well well.Don't get stopped by the fact that this game is about cars or look like football if you don't like any of these two things.Rocket League has a unique gameplay and will provide you as many hours of fun as you need being in split screen or online.There are new free updates every month or so and the community is quite nice (for an online game ))
1;"""Car soccer is the best game for when you want to kill 5 minutes then have it turn into an hour. Fun with strangers and even better with friends. The community isn't toxic and not many people are tryhard. You'll be quick chatting """"Wow!"""" before you even know it."""
1;"""It's a game that even though you can't get good enough at you can still have a lot of fun.This game provides those """"last minute"""" plays that makes you feel like a part of the most awesome match ever even if you are a noob.Played many hours on PS4 moved to PC and playing ever since.It's good to see a game made by some passionate guys and that care about the community and are always trying to improve (I'm looking at you NMS)"""
1;This game is awesome! Normally I am not into cars or soccer but the way this game combines the two is just phenomonal. I play this game a lot and i'm glad I found it. Rocket League is a surprisingly addictive game and I reccomend this game to anybody looking for a fun action packed multiplayer game. It's definitely worth the money.
1;I love this game so much I play it more than any of my other games. I would say get it it is so much fun to play alone or with friends with crazy modifiers to the game. I do find that I had to go out and buy a controller specifically for the game. It might just take more patients to learn keyboard and mouse most all my friends who play the game play keyboard and mouse though so its do able.I would recommend the game I have had so much fun with it.
1;no but seriouslythis game is awesome. the gameplay is intense and the replays just look so ing epic there are so many different strategies that you can carry out with your friends and i haven't even gotten into ranked yet. you should just buy this game already.
1;NOTE Because of agreements with our online service provider there are certain regions that are unable to connect to Rocket League s online multiplayer component. As a result server access is restricted in China Crimea Cuba Iran North Korea Sudan Syria Apologies to our customers in those regions. This makes me so sad
1;Very nice game Very smooth and is worth the price.If there is a toxic person just report them and move on.Nice quality and looks amazing.Realy nice tutorial and maps.It has so much combinations of cars and the crates are on point.10/10 Worth the price
1;What a Game!What a Game!What a Game!Chat disabled for 4 seconds.This game is basically football with cars.This game comes in layers.By the time you get good at something there is something new to learn.By the time you can stop all grounded shots aerial shots will start coming.By the time you can dogde the ball you'll see everyone flying and dogding.By the time you get good enough to fly and merely touch the ball you'll see someone 360 no scope.I love this game.
1;Have not been this captivated by a videogame in a long time. Approachable at many levels. Fun to play online solo or with friends.Only reason it might not be worth getting is if you have very poor or zero internet access as offline vs AI is only okay.
1;Alright... so if you thought cars we're awesome this game made cars even better. Rocket league brung cars and soccer together making this game what it is now... With your selection of your car and costimization it makes the game 2* the fun.personaly I love this game and you should try it.
1;I have had so much fun with this game! I love the customization options for the cars ball and stages. This game never gets old! There are training classes you can take to hone in on your skills you can create custom games with friends or join other random players online! If you enjoy fast cars competition and sillyness you should give this game a try!
1;I have so much fun with this game even if I suck. This is the only game I play right now that when I am playing it I am having fun. This game can sustain gameplay for several thousands of hours if you wanted it to and it is well worth your money. On top of this the DLC and in game purchases are executed perfectly.
1;One of the best implementations of cross platform multiplayer that I know of. Great gameplay for lan partys split screen family fun or just playing online. The competitive esports scene also supports this game so there are plenty of options for all types of people. DLC is addictive and affordable. Overall great game.TL DRRead the damn review pleb.
1;514 hrs at the time of review. So I'm either a sadist/masochist that enjoys playing games I don't enjoy or the other way around. Work that one out. I really do hope they come up with a Rugby (remember that Top Gear episode) or American Football mode of this. We already have football(soccer) Basketball and Ice Hockey and it's evidently not enough.Only gripe is some rubberbanding experienced even in low ping servers choose your servers wisely Psyonix.
1;This game is just flat out amazing. I picked this game up last year and have been playing it almost every day since. Its so fun and addicting I can not get enough of it. I would recommend it to anyone who likes cars that can fly. 10/10 would play soccer with cars again. XDDDddDDDd
1;Yup it's soccer with cars.Pros Solid skill based gameplay plays just like a sport Multiple awesome gamemodes covering both casual and competitive Great graphics audio and soundtrack Great base price microtransactions are only for rare cosmeticsCons Don't expect anything mind blowing from random cosmetic drops unless you pay for keys
1;Get some friends or make friends in game at your level and play play play. After 200 hours you'll finally be feeling confident. After 500 hours you realize you'll need 3000 more hours to be as good as a pro. Have fun. It's the toxic teams that lose most of the time. They tilt their own teamate by spamming what a save! I know I throw on purpose when they do that. Play ranked not for grinding your rank but so that you won't be placed with ridiculously easy or difficult opponents.
1;when you leave a ranked game it asks you if you would like to rejoin. if you say NO you are forever unable to join back in with friends. PLEASE ADD A FIX. I from Time to time need to switch internet connecting for better ping. i have two internet providers because i live out in the middle of no where.
1;pros 1. it's a really fun game 2. it's easy to learn hard to master 3. cross platform (ps4 and pc) 4. only 20 dollars for a game that can keep you entertained for a long time.cons 1. servers are offline a lot as is ofcourse expected with an online game launching 2. doesn't work with all controllers but there are programs that can solve this problem so not really a big dealoveral a really great game and i'll be playing this for a long time i'm sure.
1;MatchMaking is ed up... I once played against 4 levels above me then 3 levels below so as people can be boosted easily since there is no cap for ranked that play together so... I even once won twice then lost 1 and got demoted 0.0 Anything else is awesome so 7/10 When they will change a bit the matchmaking it will be 10/10
1;The amount of hours I could put into this game..... Seriously if you want to play a sports game that is arcade y and extremely fun choose Rocket League. This is a game I can always rely on and will never get old whether I'm playing by myself or with friends.
1;"""This is the most incredible well polished and addicting game ever. So many game modes and the new drop shot mode is amazing for fine tuning your air game. Ranking system has come a long way and for someone who has a hard time sticking to a game and despite getting frustrated at climbing the ladder I will always come back to Rocket league. Buy this game amazing """"bang per buck"""" value here. Keep up the great work Devs."""
1;"""So a while ago my brother got a computer and got this stupid game called """"rocket league"""" but little did i know that that stupid game would come to take up 277 hours of my life. This is the best game in the world. Look up best in the dictionary and you will see a picture of rocket league. Download this game immediatly!!Update 11/23/17 Still the best!! 460 hours in SOOO MUCH FUN!!"""
1;Very great game the way this game exploded from a game that no one new about (super sonic rocket powered) that no one really knew about to Rocket League its pretty amazing how much Psyonix has changed the graphics in this game and made it cheap r8 10/10 m8.....
1;AMAZING GAME!!!!!!However the matchmaking is SOOOOOOOO ED UP!You're teammates that get matched with you play like they just started the game thus preventing you from being able to rank up any higher than you are. The only way around that is to find someone to play with all the time who makes a good team with you.
1;game is good though ranked is full of entitled little kids that think they own the servers...these servers require clensing of those entitled punk kids..but other than that its a great game expect to be raged at for playing normaly in every match you join... Enjoy
1;Cons Why aren't the cars female it's 2017 Where are the cars eyes I thought this was like my favourite movie Cars 2 Where's the story Why so many Hd graphics too much I can't concentrate on the game Ranking system is rigged I keep scoring own goals Overall good game 9/10 would recommend again
1;Great game overall. Having so much fun after just a few days. Extra note for Mac users don't worry about the hardware requirements the description says you need a 2.4 GHz processor and 8 GB of RAM but I'm running it with a 1.6GHz processor and 4GB of RAM and it works perfectly.
1;When I first looked at the game I didn't know how fun a game of soccer would be. But now this is one of my go to games when I do not know what to play. It combines cars with soccer. Highly suggest picking this game up if you are interested in trying something new.
1;Product received for free. I hate driving games.I hate sports games.I love Rocket League quite what the mix of content is that makes it so appealing I'm really not sure and had I not got this as a freebie when buying Steam Link I'd never have played it... but 1000 hours later it's the game I hate to love.
1;I recommend this game to literally everybody . It's fun to play it in a casual way and it's very challenging to try getting better . The dev are doing a great job . Almost 0 bug . A lot of customization . Many dlc but it's not helping you in game ( not in the pay2win style ) .
1;A successful marriage of football and racing this game offers fast paced action and tactical considerations all along. Controls require a bit of training but the tutorials are fine and the league system eases the player gradually into the most complex maneuvers. Graphics are sweet replays are real eye candy! There a lots of single and multiplayer modes to choose...Start this game at the same time with your friends to make sure you are all on the same skill rank and enjoy the multiplayer more!
1;Simple game with simple rules but hard to master with a high skill ceiling but there are enough people playing that there are always games to play at your level. Easy to pick up and play for a few minutes or a few hours. Hard to fault this game or the devs.
1;Awesome game hooked since SARPBC was released for PS3. What they did with Rocket League was jumping on the big plane making an awesome game even more awesome and doing so for many more years to come!Very nice game for kickin' a few rounds after a hard day of work but also for diggin' deep and mastering a masterpiece.
1;This right here is clearly one of the must buy games on PC. Plenty of different cars to choose from to suit your liking. Before then flying off onto the football field where you can score some amazing aerial goals with flames sticking out of the exhaust on your car.10/10 Love the fact that it only takes 1 second to load the different maps (for real).
1;Great game except for the ranking system. It is totally flawed. 1/2 the times it pairs newbies with veterans and everything in between. Also the whole leaving a match and getting banned for 15 minutes is stupid. The mailman came and I ran to the door for maybe 25 seconds to come back to me being kicked for being idle and banned for 15 min from all online gameplay.Not a huge deal except for people like me who have a newborn and try to get a game in here/there now I lost chance for awhile.
1;Best GameRocket leage is the best game. My brother got this game and I family shared it with my brother and loved it until the summer sale when I bought it and got serious. As of this review I have 500 hours and they were all well spent on this excellent game. I have recommended this game to so many people and nobody has said bad things as this is the best game ever created. Buy it now or you are just missing out nerd.
1;This game is really fun and is very different to other games. It is rare and unusual to see a game about cars and soccer but when you start playing the game you cant stop playing it its that fun. I really recommend this game if you are wondering if you should get this game.
1;Recommended games are really fun when you get matched with the right people. But know the matchmaking is a mess now and people are nothing like when the game first came out. Used to be a fun community now it's a lot of people crying all the time. Turn off chat and hide crates. Oh right they want you to pay for loot. Welcome to 2017.
1;Rocket League is a excrutiatingly long game with laborious comes and goes. This makes it addictive yet also fun. Through each and every game you find that the controls will get easier and you will find rocket league more appealing. This is why most people would probably find it more positive than negative but even so Rocket League is one of my personal favorites and I encourage everyone to play it.
1;I love this game it's a very cool combination of cars and football. You can also double jump and fly and with those combined you can make extroardinary goals!It's mostly multiplayer which doesn't glitch or anything. The matchmaking is also very good.I hope this review was usefull to you i really recommend this game if you are thinking about buying it.Trust me it's money well spend D!
1;As of 100 hours of playing I must say its a challenging game in so many ways its so much fun and very rewarding as you dont necissarily need to open Cases to get some cool stuff I got a pair of super rare wheels for trading some Turbos haha. Recommended for sure ) (but be prepared to get angry sometimes)
1;I used to play a browser based 2D soccer game called Haxball years ago. I played this a lot and then I found Rocket league soon after it came out. Either Rocket League is 3D Haxball or Haxball is 2D Rocket League. I fell in love immediately. My enthusiam for this game has not changed since I purchased it.
1;Soccer with cars that you can make fly. Very percise controls. Good servers good graphics that aren't too system intensive. Arbitrary resolution support. I dislike the monitized cosmetic scheme but other than that this game is fantastic. Very high skill cap yet also very casual. Match Making is pretty solid in ranked play.
1;Simply amazing game. The possibilities for new mechanics are countless the skill ceiling is high matchmaking is great everything is balanced well. Impossible to tire of. Probably dare I say it the greatest game of the 21st century and possibly beyond.
1;Do you like Epic shots? Do you like landing on your back and spinning in circles thanks to nitro? DO YOU LIKE EXPLOSIONS?Cuz this game is full of that and more. Holy crap this game is both fun and a joy to play. The controls are a little funky if you don't have an Xbox or Playstation plug in controller but for someone like me who does it's a blast. If you don't have a PS4 you don't have to cry in vain cuz Steam brings the goods to the front door of YOUR PC.
1;I Think Rocket league is Totally awesome! I play Rocket League because i play Soccer! It's basically Soccer but Humans Are switched with cars. I Played Rocket league About a Year ago... My level is 62 900+ hours Steam Says. I Would say when Your About the Level 60 It's Basically really hard to Level up To Rocketeer But if u every had to Choose a steam Game I Definetly Would say Rocket league. I Know King of the hill is fun but I would say Rocket league is The best game I Have.
1;This game is absolute joy to play if you have a controller. 8/10I love playing this game with friends and have gotten alot of laughs from it.A warning though to people that do not have an xbox controller for their computer you might get the wrong impression of the game just by not playing with a controller.
1;This game is as close to perfect as they come. The mechanics are simple the execution takes hundreds (if not thousands) of hours to master.The games are only five minutes long.The matchmaking is solid.The maps are varried enough to feel like you're having a different experience but similar enough that the core gameplay is unchanged (which is exactly what I think map designs should strive for).It's excellent.
1;Though I have some gripes with this game (camera + controls mostly) it's pretty addictive still. 7/10Update after 300+ hours of play still have some problems with the camera and controls but I have gotten used to it somewhat. Otherwise considering I'm still pretty addicted to the gameplay it's just loads of fun. I'm raising my verdict 8/10 )
1;There are certain games that you instantly fall in love with.That's rocket league for me. From the start it was clear the developers love working on this game and have put their hearts and souls into making it the great game that it is. They listen to feedback constantly fix any issues that may arise and have made it possible to be an awesome community of both competitive and casual players alike.I cannot recommend this game enough.
1;"""An extremely entertaining game with a strong competitive balance grounded in simple and symmetrical mechanics. Entirely skill based though some luck can aid you. I nominated this for an award because some shots and plays are indeed """"face melting."""""""
1;Game has gotten a lot better as far as server performance and the community. This game has taken over most of my gaming time (550 hours as of this review). I love this game. Watching gameplay videos is not enough of an endorsement. You need to just get it and play it to know how much fun it is.
1;It's rare to find a decent game that's updated often and actually cared about especially when there's also limited toxicity.While this game gets very boring very quickly on occasion I highly recommend it. If you play it it's much better with a controller IMO. The graphics are also stunning. &lt 3
1;Product received for free. Hi Psyonix I have been in some trades recently and when ever i trade for anything it does not come up specially crates and imports.I dont know if i done something wrong but i want my items back.I hope you can fix this soon Bye.
1;ive played an awful lot of this game and i want to say this is a great action packed multiplayer game that anyone can enjoy this graphics are amazing this control are an 9/10.(some just dont feel right but everyone has there own opion) i wish it would be a little cheaper because im not feeling the $ 20 it takes to play this game i feel 10 15 to buy. but dont we all wish every game was that or even free. if your really in to this game and you have watched game play and you love it buy it.
1;Rocket league is just pure rocket powered fun. It's been out for a while but my buddies and I still enjoy playing. There are a lot of unlockables to play for but the real joy is mastering all of the various techniques at your disposal to really excel at the game.Best sports game I've ever played.
1;My friends played this for nearly a year before I decided to try it which I shouldve done much earlier. It's a very skillbased game where you can easily sht on others or get sht on. Lot of smurfing involved of course as in other games but this is extremely satisfying fast and chill to play. I can basically play this all day almost. Think I already have like 1200 hours. Great game with an insane value for most. If you tend to suck at games this is maybe not for you.
1;i have play many a nights with friends offline 4 player with this game it is pure adrenaline racing high flying action it is one of the fastest games to pick up and longest to master! the ranking system is very well done and community is very helpful expect some which is to be expected!!
1;This game is incredibly original than other games. Almost no bugs. We're getting updated content quite often. Many things you can style your car with. Great fun with friends.It's hard you can't use your skills from other games. It needs time to learn.
1;This is one of those games that can be a lot of fun to play but is ruined by horrible and toxic players in the game. I heard vile and disgusting language especially vulgarity and profanity then loads of racism and bigotry. Some written some said in voice. I simply could not believe the things that were said... and that was before I even logged into the game.
1;If you are looking for a game that offers hours upon hours of fun with your friends I recommend this game! Wether you want to flame your friends in 1v1/2v2/3v3 or flame your friends and teammates for missing shots against randoms THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! I recommend playing with a controller because it allows for more aircontrol but keyboard and mouse do the job just the same. But seriously give this game a shot...you'll love it!
1;"""When my friend told me to buy this game. I knew it was going to be good.Especially after watching Dunkey play it. But I had no Idea it would bring back all thosememories from playing soccer from middle school and high school. It has to be for sentimentle reasons but this game is really hard to put down. Much betterthan I would have expected it to have been. It's my nominee for the 2017 """"Better than Expected"""" Reward."""
1;"""This game is unlike any other where there are clear differences in skill level when playing online opponents. Unlike other multi player experiences you can still have fun at your """"skill level"""". Update The one complaint I have with this game after more than 2 years of playing is that they still have server issues where the action will not be in sync with your screen on close plays and they will go against you."""""""
1;The game is very unique and fun but I have decided to quit due to the fact I got scammed which is my fault. But after being scammed I feel like I don't need to play or the fact it's not fun enough anymore/enjoyable anymore the game is really fun and addicting tho would definitely recommend D
1;Amazing game. Well executed easy to learn difficult to master but if you have even a slightly poor connection the game becomes impossible to play. If you internet drops even a slight bit the game becomes unplayable and you're useless until the internet bounces back. Still its super fun and more enjoyable with xbox controller. If you don't own this you're seriously missing out.
1;This game is absolutely amazing! It is endless hours of fun and when playing with friends it is absolutely hilarious. Lot's of cool customization before DLC and even if you buy the DLC it's nice and cheap. 100% worth the cost! The one and only thing I wish though is that they add more types of cars but I'm sure eventually they will have more to choose from.
1;I had been playing this game for 4 months before I quit. I loved it so much but the game just got so repetitive and stale that I got so bored playing the game I didn't log into my Steam for a week. It's an amazing game with a really cool concept and a great future with a strong YouTube presence but unless they add new game modes and tone down the crates a bit I see alot of the fan base of this great game get bored and move away.
1;At first this game might seem to be a little hard to play but when you get used to it you'll see great potential in this game! Most important thing here is to have fun no matter if you lost or win a match. And if you do then this game can become one of your favorites. )
1;Did you know that you can play this if you have discord? Just go and write this in a chat basketball red_car That is when you are playing hoops mode hehe.This game can be really fun to play especially with friends but it can also be very frustrating and competitive strongly competitive.It is a good game overall recommended.
1;Best online multiplayer game I played since Counter Strike 1.6. Very addicting and action paced gameplay beautiful graphics and never ending fun with friends. Great for LAN and Couch sessions. Also appreciate DLCs with new cars paints rocket trails or wheels. Never had so much fun with friends on a single game before but Rocket League seems like a very good start. Gameplay 10/10Graphics 9/10DLCs 9.5/10Overall 10/10.
1;It'd be cool if you could customize a car for the blue team and one for the red. I like to have my car look great and the nitro hats and antenas are not helping my car look good in one team or another... But in rest is a great game and is worth buying even more when you have 3+ friends playing
1;"""During the Steam Autumn Sale I nominated Rocket League The """"Five More Minutes"""" Award. In spirit of that award I felt this review should reflect that. Rocket League can be summarised in the following three words FIVE.......MORE.......MINUTES......."""
1;The game froze during a competitive match so I closed the game. When I restarted the game and was asked if I'd like to rejoin (about 20 seconds later) I said Yes. It failed to join and now I'm banned. So here I sit with 15 minutes writing this review.Great game. Lots of fun. Highly competitive.I've had the game on Xbox for a year now and finally switched to PC. I hope I'll be able to lobby with my console account so I can trade my items over.4/5 stars for now
1;Awesome game I play this on PS4 on a regular basis. I won't be playing it on a PC anytime soon though because even on a GTX 660M (which should be well above minimum specs) it plays like a slideshow dropping at times below 10 FPS even on lowest settings. Better stick to my PS4 for now.
1;At my first glance I thought this game had the dumbest premise ever. Flying cars playing football/soccer? 2 hours later... oh I'll play just one more than I'm done12 hours later.... I'm pretty tired I think I'll go to sleep now. It's a fun game frustrating sometimes but a lot of fun.
1;Damn noce game. OS You want to play footbal? Are you the fat kid who plays the goalkeeper.. Well NOT ANYMORE!! Be the scorer and the fat goalkeeper. And don't even run! (just run to go to the bathroom or to the kitchen while the match is loading and between the goal previews).
1;I love this game! Even if you are not a football amateurs like me you will enjoy this game thanks to the huge range of options and all updates from time to time update makes the game a different experience! In my opinion there are all sorts of additives that can increase the fun of the game as a tune when inserted Gaulle. The DLC will not give you skills but it give you options to design the cars and get new cars.The Bottom Line Buy this game as soon as possible!
1;You could be having the best day of your life. Just got some . Scored a gram or 2 of the dank dank. You get home grining ear to ear so you turn on your computer to play rocket league and have fun but this game will get you saltier than a horse's salt block.
1;what will bring you satisfaction while playing this game? score a goal?...maybe do some epic saves? could be do some acrobatics that end in a cool pass that leads to a goal? pretty cloe BEING THE SALT DEMON THE NIGHTMARE OF YOUR FRIENDS AND RANDOM TEAMMATES?...HELL YEAH10/10 friendships will be tested
1;So to be honest after i played this game almost for 1400hs there are no words that can describe how good this game is. Have tons of friends? This is the great game to spend hours and hours united with them. And if you dont have them you can meet every kind of people out there playing and having the same common things you love and hate. When i started playing i couldn't stop. A good online game is a new adventure im already in. Are you also ready for it? See you at the field champion.
1;This game is really fun and competitive at the same time. This game has the best chance to succed in and strive for champion ships and tournaments because the community is great. I also was a ble to learn how to freestyle and now Me and MY OWN TEAM play in tournaments ladder and stream and freestyle every week! ) I reccomend this game! GO AND BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!
1;"""The community (especially at lower ranks) is pretty sour. So either turn chat off or team up with friends demolish them and feed off their tears!After 400 hours of laughter loud cheers that irritates the girlfriend and mega rage that irritates her even more... I still find myself playing all the time eager to reach the top and perfecting my skills.The satisfaction when you hit a """"TOTALLY CALCULATED"""" AMAAAAAAAAAAAAZIIING GOAAAAAAAAAL... it's great."""
1;This is a really polished fun satisfying game with a very high skill ceiling due to its balance between mechanical and strategic play. It's one of those rare games that's super addicting from the very beginning it just shifts from being fun because everyone is hilariously bad to being fun because of how satisfying it is when you pull off some high level play. I'm 400 hours in but I can see myself playing for at least another thousand.
1;Hello!!! This is an awesome game and it is one of my favourite games. I like the combination of cars and football or basketball hockey etc. I have bought all the dlc except from the soundtracks. I love this game and I had recorded over 500 hours on my previous account!!! I hope you add even more dlc and can't wait to get them
1;Very good game. Awesome graphics and runs perfectly on any pc with i5 or higher. Also this is a not a pay to win game. The items you can purchase are only accessories which change the appearance of the car you play in. They dont influence the gameplay. Very addicting game!
1;Rocket league also known as known as gaming heroin is a game that is so addicting you simply can't stop playing once you start. Quite frankly I don't know how I took time out of it to write this snip. Get it enjoy it and have fun unlocking everything so you can rainbow boost your sunbrero donned rocket car into that perfect aerial shot. And miss. Every. Single. Time. 10/10
1;I came from Xbox and after having 720 hours played I had to buy this game again. It's the most addicting game I've played in a while and the constant updates from Psyonix keep me interested. If you're looking for a game you can just jump into and play for 10 minutes or 6 hours this is it. This game is one of the best eSports in recent years. 10/10
1;If you like soccer trucks explosions and driving vehicles on the ceiling or any two of the preceding items then this game dose not disappoint! If you are interested in rockets... It dose not deliver all that much in the way of rockets maybe try kerble space program?
1;Well I enjoy the game very much DGood points about this game #1.I like the concept of cars shooting balls#2.I like the fact the game can be very fun with its creative modes#3.I like the Game for its Adrenaline.#4.Cool funny looking cars stickers Flags and etc.#5.Fun to kill time at.#6.Love it!Cons *The Servers lag a lot meaing ping would be high meaning u will lose the game too*There could have been more maps and stages i feel the maps are not enough.
1;i dont usually like sports games and all the fun people were having in letsplays looked me skeptical since in my experience i hate sports related games but this is a fantastically fun multiplayer experience and a great couch game. i dont think ive ever played a game for this many hours that didnt have any sort of campaign. recommended.
1;Such an awesome game. 100% would recommend.This game is currently 15 but I would happily pay 50 for it. The developers are fantastic bringing free DLC with the occasional small purchase DLC. I couldn't ask for more from them. Great game even if you don't like car games or if you don't like sports games. The community is mostly friendly too.
1;Great skill progression and depth. Game starts off with hilarious chaos as you learn to just hit the ball in the right direction. As you gain control you start to make crazy plays and work as a team. One of the best games I've ever played. Oh and devs constantly add new (FREE) game modes like hockey and basketball.Edit um rumble is so much fun and once again... FREE! Love Psyonix
1;This game is more addicting than heroin.Played this for the first time on my friend's PS4. Liked it so much I bought my own PS4 to play it. After 500 hours of playing it on PS4 I found out I could be better by playing on PC. Went out and built a PC just for Rocket League. WTF is wrong with me?
1;One of my favorite games! In my opinion this game is fun only if you are playing with friends. Btw i recommend you to use a controller bcs it's better and much easier.I used to play this game this summer when my arm was broken and I had to find a game to play with only one hand )))
1;Recommand it 8/10 PROS funny gameplay A lot of car costumisation Updates comeing every month A lot of gamemodes CONS A lot of visual bugs RL its a bit expensive as a Romanian im still useing the country's type of money and 20 E its like 100 LEI for me.
1;"""Hit play and see the magic yourself. I was like """"wtf is this game"""" before ever played it. Now cant play any other game without waiting for round to end and start RocketLeague afterwards. Gives you the emotions you need and takes away all the stress.Nomintaed to be best game for latest years!"""
1;Rocket league is a game where if you had friend and asked them to play you've either made your friendship stronger or no longer talk that's rocker league for youEDIT Just a quick bit of advice to the peoole who down vote the game because of the crates. You don't have to get the keys for them so it's your choice not the games it's all cosmetic stuff
1;So with over 120 hours currently on this game I can say that I still have yet to get tired of it. This is one of the best games I've ever played. Usally I get bored pretty fast with games but this one just keeps me coming back for more. Definitely recommend it.
1;I have never played a game with this level of replayability. It's incredibly easy to pick up but has an almost nonexistent skill ceiling. After playing for hundreds of hours you are always learning new things and improving. The gameplay is incredibly fun and intense and includes many game modes to vary up the game a bit. I have run into a few issues with connectivity but it's nothing major.If you don't like crates or microtransactions then don't buy them and stop whining.
1;A fun game that keeps evolving both in free content paid content and gameplay. A sportslike primary multiplayer game where personal skill and teamplay decides the outcome. The tactics and strategies employed in this game change over time as it's growing pro scene continues to innovate to gain an edge.You looking for a new obsession or just a casual game with friends this is it.P.S. Consider using a controller to play this game.
1;Rocket League is the type of game you can play for hours on end as it is very addicting. It is also the type of game you can play for jusst 10 20 mins at a time as the games are quite short! It is a game with a very simple concept and i enjoy the sharp movements and fast paced gameplay. Pros They are constantly updating it with new things e.g Hoops etc.Cons No own goal systemNo xbox one cross platform multiplayer.9/10
1;This game is super addicitve. The new hoops mode is incredible the ball physics around the net is well done. The fact that the wheels of the rocket cars squeek like shoes on a court is an awesome little thing that helps with the immersion into the basketball world.
1;Fantastic game with loads of customisation good split between people that play for fun and those who play competitively. Good feeling of accomplishment when you rank up in competitive mode. The only downside I have found is the extreme bait to buying keys to further customise your car. Overall this is probably my favourite game.
1;Rocket League is a fantastic game. It is full of hilarious hours especially with friends!The ranked system adds a working competitive element! Hoping for this game to join eSports!And might I add Aerial wall jumps/goals and full on rocket goals. WHAT A FEELING! xD
1;Rocket Leagues basic mechanics are quite simple. Scoring goals and win matches. But when it comes to master the game you can put hundreds of hours into the Game. Making it great for people interested in E Sport Games and competing against other players.Besides its Gameplay Rocket League has a quite friendly (compared to other Games of the Genre) and helpfull Community. Psyonix is very productive Developer and the professional Esport Scene of the Game is growing more and more.
1;Overall amazing game go shoot some ball with a car that can explode others and fly trough the whole arena. Can not get much better than that right?. Little bit sad about the crate system not a fan of that. And the new reward system from season 5 also not a big fan. Besides that nothing wrong.
1;Pros Very fun game to play alone or with friends. Different from most of the games you see nowadays. Nice and frequent updates. Good community. Cons Rank system better ever season but stil too much based on win streak and not in game actions. No free new content like cars only a fews maps nothing agaisnt paid content but they should realese some more free content as well to balance it.
1;Very addicting and awsome to play with friends and without.Have you every wondered how would it be to crash a car into a giant football? Well this is basically it but it's a mini car and a regular sized football which makes it technically the same. Then add nitro into their engines and a SpeedRacer jumping gear with a sudden zero gravity propulsers that can only be used once a jump.
1;Rocket League executes a simple idea beautifully with nuanced controls lending themselves to both skillful displays and screwball comedy. Rocket League also had a perfect balance of fun and competitive gameplay. This game is a must for... Well for everyone really. Doon Savage
1;A brilliant game to enjoy for 5 minutes or 5 hours. No two matches are ever the same multiple different game modes and plenty to choose from in the workshop. The many game modes much more than you might expect. Especially good if you have limited time and want something fun to play.
1;If you're looking for a fast paced car game with balls I think this is top 1. Better with friends Competitive Scene Growing Community. All around great game with all major known bugs fixed No issues with FPS unless you have a toaster and banging soundtracks
1;it may take a little time to be good and all but once you do this game is just pure entertainment i have to be honest when i say i have become obssesed with this game there are so many game modes that are also really fun like dropshot and rumble i highly recommened this game and it is also only $19.99 so it is not that expensive
1;300+hours on xbox one.Only cons in this game If your internet is bad you will get put against higher level players much better than you and scammers if you don't know how to avoid them these are literally all I can think of other than that an absolute amazing game.
1;I really like the different combinations of items and I really like the Hoops mode. What I dislike is the people with who I play. Sometimes I play with Rookies (which I hate to play with) with Masters/Pros (I don't like it because I can't do anything) or with AI (I dislike it 'cause sometimes they auto goal the team where they are. Please fix those AI auto goals.
1;Great game if you dont own it yet buy it you'll get what you paid for in no time. Takes a lot of practise and I would recommend playing it with a controller. If you decided you like the game anough you can buy keys and get cool cosmetic items through opening crates or trading. My only request is that they add the community market to the game other than that a truely amazing game.10/10
1;This game is really fun but if you get it on pc quite often the servers act poor and you get constant UNPLAYABLE lag like warping around the stage if you have a ps4 or xBox One I would recommend you get it on those platforms. The game is also cross platform so xbox players can join with pc players anyways. Please stabilise your servers as this is a great game. READ THE COMMENTS
1;This is the best game ever! After I quit DCUO in 2015 I was on the search for another game and then this amazing game came out. The game is all about fun and even if your not good you'll still have fun. The developers care immensely about this game and are always creating great content be it free or paid. More people need to get this game!
1;I'm sure I'm not really adding anything to what's been said about this game already but very few games have been able to hold my attention over a long period of time like Rocket League. I haven't even played it that much compared to a lot of people but it keeps me coming back for more.It says a lot about a game that even though I'm pretty terrible at it I still enjoy playing it. But people probably don't enjoy playing with me. Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
1;I frickin love Rocket League it's the sort of game that's both simple and accessible at the surface yet incredibly engaging and infinitely complex at a deeper level. Just don't buy the crates. Once you do you cannot stop. I am not kidding. I'm having to work multiple dead end jobs in order to support my crate opening habits. Help me please. But besides that Rocket League is truly a fantastic game. I would absolutely reccomend it for anyone who needs an escape from their stressful lives.
1;I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. This game is exelent!!! The only downside is that a couple of the maps are a little bit laggy on my low end PC. Besides that this game runs like a dream. If you're even a little bit unshure as to weather or not to get the game then you should just get the game because once you do you'll be addicted for the next 20 years. XD
1;This game.... Friend told me to buy it and I did not knowing what to expect. I don't play any racing games and this is far from it. Couldn't think of a better way to spend every nite blowing up other cars flying thru the air and scoring goals. Over 250 hours played and even though my gf hates it I would not change a thing! &lt 3
1;Legendary game. Simple skillful and so entertaining. The best for an eSport game. Its totally about your skill and god bless the developers they provide something new every month. New modes pitches cars accessories everything. You can always find matches couse there are so many players. I hope somedays the other developers will be that hard working too.Some little problems yet to repair 1v1 match we cant exit if we give up some 1v1 match servers are unsteady (ping problems)
1;THIS GAME. THE PHYSICS. THE TOXIC ING PEOPLE. THE ING HACKERS (YES THERE ARE HACKERS AND THE DEVS DONT GIVE 2 ) THE FACT THAT I GET DDOSED EVERY NIGHT. THE SERVERS. THE MATCHMAKING. THE ABSOLUTELY BROKEN POINT SYSTEM. EVERYTHING ELSE THAT I FORGOT BECAUSE THIS T......With that said. 8/10
1;Well what can i say about rocket league.... It's an amazing game It's fast paced and a lot of fun. DLC is all cosmetic no buying an advantage in this gameWhen i first got this game it was free on PS+ with my PS4 it was one of the first games i bought on steam when i got a pc earlier this year. I would reccomend this game to anybody after a fast paced competitive game9/10
1;I like the game its so much fun there are endless possibilities of what can happen. I think the controlls are amazing (i use mouse and keboard) and its also addictive its always gonna leave you saying t yourself just 1 more match. The community is very active and i dont think this is gonna die anytime soon
1;favorite game great for playing with friends great for not playing with friends one thing is that you almost HAVE to have a controller if you want to 'get guude' at the game not saying you cant reach grand champ without... but i kinda am but thats my opinion P anyways 11/11 great game and great creators along with great concept along with great updates
1;0/100 real quick most fun and addicting game ever in the universe and also very fun with some fun with it but it's also very addictive and fun and add me to play better than a orgy with the hottest girls/guys in the history of ever defintly get it asap add me to play it's fun fam.
1;"""This game is 1. Fast (Queue times matches loading and the actual driving)2. Fun (Playing with random people and with friends customizing your car spamming """"What a save"""")3. Friendly (No bugs or glitches no lag settings menus)4. Future driven (Updates with new arenas new cars new gamemodes new items)Overall freaking amazing.10/10 IGN"""
1;This is a really good game but don't buy it if you play solo. I have been playing solo for a few days and it keeps annoying me that I join matches with a bot that are 0 5 behind. This is just impossible to win vs 2 other players. As long as you have a premade to play with its fine though. If that's the case you should buy this game.
1;"""I got it! This is one nice shot of a game. You will have no problem picking it up for the first time. Eventually you'll get to grips with the game and will be able to take the shot whenever the time is right. Within seconds of beginning to play you'll be saying """"wow"""" to the billions of different customisation options and you'll be shouting """"noooo"""" as you just lose in a close one with your mates.This sure is one hell of a game that everyone should give a go."""
1;Its the best game but would be better if each car had more characteristics such as it it has a low acceleration but high top speed or high accleration and low top speed and dlc cars should have more to them and be better than the non dlc cars. Definately recomended
1;"""I will recommend this game but just have to say the quality of the servers are often very very poor. When the whole thing breaks down there is no EU tech team ready to get it up again we have to wait until its """"day"""" in the US. Frustrating not for people with high bloodpressure who loves to get teamed up with PSY noobs that has so long load time they join the server 2 3 minutes after everyone else."""
1;Deleted this game because its ing annoying as when your getting ed by RNG ball bounces. Almost wrecket my entire room because of this game and had to change my mouse because i broke it during one match. 11/9 would download this game to delete it again.It happened again i rate this game a perfect 5/7
1;A really addictive game.Easy to learn the basics and hard to master but also unique in all the ways you can freestyle with the ballPlaying with friends makes my mouth hurt because all the smiles and laughs i highly recommend it to play it with your pals
1;Fantastic game with a great skill ceiling. Constantly room to improve and you are never really good. Easily my favorite developer with continuous updates and free content mixed with DLC. Even better with friends. Soccer is my least favorite sport but soccar is my favorite.
1;Amazing game! This game is so fun and i dont think i will get bored of this game. Very good matchmaking on 1vs1 but if you wanna play 2vs2 you're gonna need a person you know to play with or else with random person u will always lose . I just hope you can make the matchmaking better but other than that i love this game.
1;Great game addictive just remember to have fun (and you will) while getting to know the physics and controls. Can be frustrating at times. Still trying (and failing) like hell to fly and score an aerial goal. I highly recommend to play it with friends.10/10
1;How about this Every time a game is about to start and I see that we're playing on a standard vanilla map it lights up my day. Because the core game the physics the mechanics etc. are so well balanced that no gimmicks at all are required. Rocket League is just a really compelling competitive experience with a perfect learning curve and an impossibly high skill ceiling.
1;Product received for free. First bought the game for ps4 and had a blast with friends. Decided to switch my playing preference to Pc and my god one of the most addictive games i have ever owned. The learning curve is defnitely up there but at just over about 400 collective hours im already at diamond level in comp and i feel thats really good with such a high learning curve.
1;One of the most balanced and skill oriented competitive games around. Full of exciting car models and skins to choose from. Lots of customization in all aspects of the game. If you want a competitive game to consume your time or casual. Get. This. Game.
1;Love this game. I play it on my mac and the quality is not great but I get a good 60 frames on medium settings. This game has so many game modes that you will never be tired of it. If you play it with friends it is so much fun just to get in there and play a rumble match or drop shot. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a casual fun game that can be competitive at times
1;With almost 900 hours logged I'll give a review.This game is simply amazing very addictive and overall fun.I would however like to see more attention to the hockey part but other than that probably one of the best games purchased in a very long time an extreme amout of replayability.
1;This simple game is deceptively addicting and will ruin you if you have a competitive spirit like me. If you can get hooked on something easily and have no self control then I suggest that you don't play this game because the only time you put it down is when you're the 1st Place winner of the RLCS and retire. And even then you may not quit.... 10/10
1;Phenomenal. One of the best games I have played ever. It has a somewhat high learning curve but more than makes up for it with some of the most rewarding gaming experiences that can be found.I could say more so much more but the game speaks for itself.It's car soccer but it's so much more than that.
1;Rocket League is a game that's easy to learn yet hard to master. Within a day you'll have the basics grasped within a week you'll be good on the ground within a month you can fly and then after a year... you're hooked.An excellent game with unobtrusive microtransactions and devs who listen to the community. What multiplayer games should be.
1;&gt match starts&gt i bump 10 people first 10 seconds&gt 2 minutes in the game&gt teammate is about to score a goal&gt i accidently bump them&gt gets triggered at me&gt i bump them again accidently&gt teammate now is working for the other team&gt calls vote to surrenderbumping simulator
1;Amazing game to profit from. I did a nothing to something and i profited 150 dallars e z. The competitive game is great as well i love how they hand out season rewards at the end of each season thats something ive never seen befor (might be because ive never done any comp. games like this before).
1;You just need to look at the hours I have played the game to see if I like it or not.I'm a soccer fan but I hate the physics of the new FIFA games so this game fits the spot perfectly for me. I even recommend it for someone who doesn't like sports but likes competitive games. Pros Addictive Fun Easy to start playing hard to masterCons Paid DLCs (mostly cosmetic so you don't have to buy it)Overall this game is relatively cheap specially on steam sales so It is easily worth buying
1;As you get better the game gets better. Matchmaking hasn't been bad for me but I play unranked only.They do more game modes though. Online seasons or some way of grouping unranked players in divisions would be nice. True playlists would be nice where one game is standard one is experimental etc. With the popularity of the game you would they would still be working on it ......
1;This game is like crack for me if I want to play for a bit &amp game for 5min this is the game of choice. I brings something refreshing to the table &amp you dont have to spend the $ for DLC's to enjoy what it has to offer. For $20? Mmmmm maybe. Find it on sale if your can.
1;THIS GAME IS SO FUN!!! Pros decent amount of modes so it doesn't get stale dlc/micro transactions aren't necessary and are cheaper the almost any other game (like csgo cases) the trading in this game is top notch good or scene easy to learn hard to master much room for advanced learning and potentialCons tbh none really can get a little stale at times though
1;Aquadome map sometimes crashes game then it bans you from matchmaking for it. Remove Aquadome from ranked playlists.(Doesn't happen anymore)*Updated*Only issue now is a server went down durring match and both teams on both sides got banned from matchmaking for it.Other than that the game is great!!
1;Great game but after getting back to it after a year it has a ton of microtransactions absolutely 100 tier maps IN RANKED and just another loot crate system.It's sad to see a game this good become this festering hole.Still recommend the game though because playing with friends and banning the bad maps is still worth the money.
1;rocket league is fun and all but there's one problem. i've been playing doubles and i specifically have starbase arc disliked and i got it 3 times straight EVEN WITH IT DISLIKED. so psyonix plz in the next update fix the like and dislike system sincerely a fan
1;This game is a lot of fun to play especially with friends. I used to only play csgo after playing Rocket League for a while I realised that there are a lot of other games on Steam that I would enjoy. This game was a struggle to master at first after messing with the controls for a bit I got the hang of it pretty smoothly. D
1;Rocket League is an excellent multiplayer game that envokes competitive gameplay and a fun environment with friends. The game mechanics are good and once mastered makes for a great gaming experience. If you play in the online matchmaking the community can be quite salty. Thankfully the developers have implemented a new system to deal with this. So far it looks to be rooting out the riff raff. I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age. Its a great time.
1;When i first was about buy this game I was unsure wether or not i should buy this game. the game looked fun and all but I didn't know wether or not I was gonna play it all that much but I thought who give a crap so I did and that I don't regret at all i play this game all the time daily and i have so much fun doing so.1.Competitive2.Hard but easy to learn3.Good communityI think you should go and buy this right now cuz its high on my list and on many others
1;There's so much about this game that's perfect. The graphics are some of the best from an indie the gameplay has that uniqueness where you can't hate it (I hate playing football and FIFA games) the community PR at Psyonix is the best I have seen and I have clocked near 300 hours and regretted none of it because of the sheer replayability and fun of it.
1;Absolutely love this game hours and hours of fun...even better with friends! The exhibition games are great and when you want a bit more of a challenge the ranked matches will get you playing against people with higher skill.No complaints at all. 10/10.
1;This game is hard to see how it could be so popular to somebody who hasn t played it before. I was one of those people. I was finally convince to buy the and it was probably the best decision of my life. Love this game. Never played a game that is so frustrating...
1;The game is really good. Be prepared it has a steep learning curve. At the start you struggle to hit the ball but once you get the hang of it you get improved every day and end up doing incredible air goals. It's a very fun game especially playing with your friends. Totally a must buy!
1;Rockets cars &amp balls. Able to whack the ball for 5 minutes per game. Would recommend this game even though the learning curve is a bit steep.I like cars I dislike balls. Being able to whack the balls makes this a must buy for any year after its release date.
1;it now its really enough 1. Im challenger2 and play against challenger elite and dont rank up.. WHAT IS THIS !!2. my internet works on every gamebut in rocket league Im laggin because i have High PING ... HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE??!!!! I really like this game but i will not plasy this anymore if this will not be fixed.. that cant be real
1;I've spent over 600 hours on this game and I'm still enjoying it. The new crates cars and updates keep this game interesting. I find the occasional toxic player every few games (just mute them) but that comes with all competitive games. The learning curve for this game might make this game frustrating but if you put time and effort. You'll for sure have endless hours of playing this addictive fun game. Defiantly try it out!
1;Great game reminds me of the addiction I had to FIFA 13 (until FIFA went bad).Too bad about the current server issues but I'm sure it will be fixed soon. I don't believe the creators thought that there would be 60k concurrent users at any point in time and it's hard to blame them for that!
1;This game never gets old. Everything about it feels amazing the controls the gameplay the graphics it's all so finely tuned and with its incredible deep depth of skill and addictive competitive matches this game will be sure to break your sleeping schedule but don't worry it's worth it
1;Gameplay is super fun and addictive and somehow actually feels more like playing soccer than the FIFA games and I *LOVE* the FIFA games. Very easy to pick up challenge gradient is well done and it's hilarious. I highly recommend for either casual or hardcore gamers. I just can't decide if this is the best dumb game ever or the dumbest best game ever haha.
1;This game has to be the most addicting game ever. As soon as I started playing my friends and I never put down our controller for a good week. The multiplayer ranking honestly isn't very good and the algorithm behind ranking up or down seems to still have issues. Though seems to be improving over time and the game is being updated constantly.
1;This is a really fun game to play with friends and strangers.WHAT I LIKE Very addictive great gameplay &amp very intuitive controls and UI.WHAT I DON'T LIKE You need to buy some DLC to be able to complete all the base achievements which is sneaky and not necessary if you trust your game as a development company. Also there is no LAN mode and that always sucks.
1;Best game I've played in a long time. First of all it was pretty hard to get started hit some balls jump in the wrong direction and so on. First you have to get started with the basics don't even think about earials. But after some hours you can fly like a boss.
1;9/10 Very much would recomend this game this game is very fun when your bored of something this game actually made me quit minecraft and ive been playing minecraft for 3 years but the only thing that theres a problem but this happens rarely sometime my rank get de promo or de division But they happen rarely but still would recomend this game alot of fun A+
1;this game is probaly one of the funiest games i've played in a long time now and for $20 it's a great deal and far better than playstation and xbox version becasue you pay for it and donwload then play instead of having to pay for psn or xbox live and can run on almost any pc at the lowest settings so i would recommend this game for anyone who would want spend to much for a game and not be fun at all
1;Well this game has no problem with me... this game let me do freestyles and not like an ordinary soccer game like PES or FIFA... they run like a s**t and how fool i want to play that silly game... i can't do anything on that soccer game untill i found this amazing game! this game made me feel more challanged and intense because of the saving the ball... The point is this game is perfect amazing graphics awesome gamplay and no doubts about the game! AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!!
1;This game is one of a kind true gem. It's one of the very few games in my library that I go back to every single day just to play for fun alone or with some friends. I can tell you now that if you really want this game but don't know if you should buy it full price listen to these next two words very carefully... BUY IT. At $20 this game is a must have even more should it go on sale (which is pretty common as it has been on sale numerous times recently.
1;It's one of those games where it's easy to play but hard to master everything in the game is extremely creative and it's quite action packed you can sometimes feel yourself leaning forward to hit the ball in the game. And let's not get started on the mutators and playing with friends it is the most fun a person can have with friends Overall I think it is an absolutely FANTASTIC game and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
1;Pretty fun and awesome game is a lot more challenging that it looks like. Almost no one at the start knows this but the best part of the game is the secret trading game. A lot more fun and more adrenaline than the actual game because trading is good trading is life. 10/10 would trade again those sweets nitro crates.
1;"""It remembers me of a game called """"Road Trip Adventure"""" that I used to play with my PS2 that had a mode that was similar to this game where you could play a football match with your car. Rocket League makes me feel so nostalgic but I also have a lot of fun playing it it is so well designed and the coolest thing is that they keep creating new content so it never gets old."""
1;I'm decent at football.I'm decent at remote control cars.I'm terrible at Rocket League.Very good game only downside is that teams are often unfair with all the pros on the other team and my team is full of bots and people who are terrible (me).Definitely worth the money for this.
1;Hell yes I recommend this game. Rocket League does have an extremely high skill cap as you can do aerials but with some practice you'll get there! If you're thinking you'll only have a quick few minutes to play a game each match is about 5 minutes. Never ending fun! I would buy this again if I need to!
1;I got this game for free on PS plus. I like it so much I bought it on steam. I dont like where they have taken the game in terms of micro transactions but I guess they have to make money and I dont have to buy anything I dont want. If you want a game with flying cars and football you have found it. Buy it now. Buy it. Come on. Get it. Its real good.
1;This game is the only game that continuously have given my hart going adrenaline pumping and sweat pouring from the first time starting the game up to now 80 hours into it. Exciting easy to get into hard to master and mentally/almost physical demanding game. I never thoguht I would love this game as much as I do. 11/10
1;You drive flying rocket cars into soccer balls to score goals. Beautifully simple deceptively complex. So so so so much fun. Just buy it.Also the developer continues to push out awesome free updates and the eSports scene is burgeoning. It is 100% worth your time to play this game.
1;At first I was skeptical as to the depth of strategy in this game however my doubts were soon to be revealed as nonreal. At the surface Rocket League may appear to just be car soccer but the level of nuance packaged throughout is insane. Features in the game such as customizable cars boosts toppers (hats) and more all add to the amount of playability and replayability in this game. 10/10 would put hundreds more hours into this game.
1;What is this game?Soccer? Rocket cars? Insane fun? Weird People way too good for the League? Yeah it's all that and much more! This game can't be described but it's so much fun. Fast paced game Simple to pickup but very hard to master. A lot of customization Lots of mods and constant update Esay to lose track of time while playing.If you do not have it in your library by now what are you waiting for? At this price you won't find many games that fun.
1;The most fun game if you put some time and effort into it.Whether you just play casual or grind you way up all the way to grand champ theres something for everyone. The devs always listen to the community. New content is added frequently and it just never gets boring. Even if you are not into soccer you might still enjoy this game a whole lot.
1;There is a bit of a grind to get better but the community is suprisingly understanding. There may be trolls but it's not too toxic. I recommend finding a friend to play with that makes it way more fun. Overall it's an outstanding game which you can put many hours into and have fun.
1;One of the best purchases I've made regarding videogames. The skill ceiling for this game has so much room for growth that there's always a reason to come back and get better. Finding a game has never been a struggle nor has joining a game with friends. One of the only faults I can think of is that you'll run into the occasional salty online but that really doesn't stop the game from being a solid functional experience.Overall I think it was worth every penny 10/10 would reccomend
1;New update made a great game even better. This game can be taken seriously with competitive mode or be played casually with friends for a ton of fun. Super easy to pick up probably impossible to master. The amount of crazy and cool plays you can pull off in this game is near limitless couldn't recommend more
1;Quite honestly the best game I have ever played. Remember that feeling as a 10 year old kid opening up that brand new game and going crazy over it for a few weeks. It is just like that except it lasts the entirety of the time you play it. Seriously for such a cheap price you get some of the most fun gameplay anywhere.
1;A great game I've sunk more than a week of my life playing it and still enjoy it devs are constatly releasing new content from new maps cars even game modes like one or two a year it seems like I highly recomend this game if you want a nice soccer spin off
1;Simply an amazing game with some of the smoothest gameplay.Whether you have some hours or just 20 minutes to play the game is always waiting for you.Updates frequently which makes it more awesome. PROS fast games consisting of 5 minutes difficult to master endless amount of funCONS can get a little boring after you have played for a long time always the same9/10
1;Love this Game.This game is easy to learn but difficult to master. Its a great game to play with friends and by yourself.I enjoying playing this game in my spare time and it never gets boring especially with common updates.I recommend this game to all of my friends.
1;Remote control cars with jet engines strapped to their backs play soccer (and basketball and hockey). Fantastically addicting with a very active competitive scene as well as many modes for casual play. Cannot recommend this game enough to you buy it immediately.
1;I have clocked up 300 hrs on this. Easily accessible and great for those with limited time to play games. Easy to pick up but challenging enough to give hours of enjoyment. The bench mark for cross platform support and well priced. This has to be one of the best value games on Steam.
1;Spent all of my time in game upside down spinning on my head while screeching down the mic like a racoon in voice chat as I watched my team lose by a significant amount of goals. Completely immersive and unbeatable experience. I would buy a foxy suit then wear it and set it on fire and roll around in a field causing a forest fire that will kill thousands of innocent animals and people.
1;Rocket league is an extremely fun and addictive game that is simple to learn yet takes so much practice to master. Every game is always different and every goal you score is satisfying in it's own way. The game is really well optimized and servers are reliable and usually pretty easy to connect to. There is absolutely no reason not to purchase this game.
1;I quit other games so I could get Better at this one. This is one of those games that requires great skills .. No advantages are being sold in the market.. Develope your skills and show off or get WREKTBEST sports game I can't believe I literally quit PES and Fifa to play rocket league.. I might be insane and I like it... Kudos to psyonix
1;"""ROCKET LEAGUE EXPERIENCE *Accidentally runs into teammate*""""Wow!"""" he exclaims*Knocks ball into center field for other team to score*""""Great pass!"""" exclaims teammate""""Savage!"""" person says from the other teamREAL LIFE EXPERIENCE *Accidentally knocks co worker over in crowded room*""""Wow!"""" he exclaims*Farts real loud*""""Great pass!""""*Another co worker shouts from across the room*""""Savage!"""""""
1;You should know this is not a football gameI never played fifa/ pes but I loved this gameThis is a casual game which you control a car trying to fly and hit the ballIf you are doubting then you should probably try first!This is definitely worth more than its full price
1;Was extremely good but after the new update I may have wasted a bit if my Steam money... Why tf don't I get any cosmetics when I complete a match???????? WHY IS IT SO LAGGY WHEN I HAVE LIKE 10 PING??!?!?!!?!?!!?!!!?!!?!!?!?!? UNPLAYABLE NOW CAN'T PLAY ONLINE
1;I love this game but there needs to be some changes. There should be a much bigger penalty for quitting a competitive match the advantage that one team gets when its 3 v 2 is too great. Also if a person does quit a competitive match the handicapped team should not risk losing a rank because of it. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten a rank down because someone quit and its been a 3 v 2 or 3 v 1 match.
1;Soccer meets driving once again in the long awaited physics based multiplayer focused sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars! Choose a variety of high flying vehicles equipped with huge rocket boosters to score amazing aerial goals and pull off incredible game changing saves!
1;"""Absolutely the best Sports game ever made.The skill curve in this game has no ceiling. Explaining it as """"Soccer with cars"""" is not enough to convey what a joy it actually is to play. I got it for free on PlayStation Plus and still bought it on my PC so I can play it in my office. 10/10."""
1;Product received for free. This game is amazing. I have over 300 hrs on this game. If u ask me why well this game is addicting and also fun to play with friends. This is the type of game i will never get board of or sick of. If you are wanting to play this game and your firends have it get it. In my eyes it is worth getting this game if it not on sale it is that good. To all of my fellow Rl (Rocket league) players play on and have a great time. pce
1;Best $30 I've ever spent. Have had a couple issues with updates on my low end PC and net connection but they have always been fixed promptly! Psyonix is always in the reddit community listening and the game is fun as all can be. Did you know you can fly driving a car while and hitting a Soccar ball?
1;Product received for free. Two words Got boost?Beautiful arena almost endless car customizations to pimp your ride as you like and physics drive game to drive home the goal.... you gotta love this. Rumble mode is a throw back to super mario that everyone will love. Normal/standard play is awesome too. I love everything about this game. Rocket League is promising cure for pms I swear.
1;I just can't get enough of this game. This has replaced my competitive gaming completely (was pretty much mobas before). The last update seems to have fixed the start game crashing in Linux. Everything now seems to run well on Linux with a Steam Controller.
1;Amazing game you will love it if you're a lover of high paced adrenaline and the combination of cars with football.It's a lot of fun to play with friends and if you get really good at the game the competetive mode is for you where you can set out to be Grand Champion(The highest rank in the game).
1;I have spent so many hours in this game. Well worth every penny cannot say enough good things about both the game and Psyonix as a developer. Including all core DLC as free is something that goes against the grain of game devlopment today. I cannot help but buy every skin and car pack simply in the name of supporting such a great company. If you haven't purchased this game you're missing out.
1;U Like cars games ? Sports games ? Co op games ?well Rocket League is made for you. It features small cars fighting into well designed arenas fitted for all kind of modes available in the game. Like most car game you got boost but what is boost when you can fly with your car. Enjoy.
1;Everyday less and less players are playing so it's harder for the matchmakers to find the perfect compatible teammates and opponents sometime average joe would get overpowered opponent or super underpowered ones.Unlike the PS4 version we dont have to be friends with anyone in order for us to make party with or trade with them. But in steam version of rocket league we do. And this is another one of its weaknessThings are getting less and less interesting.
1;Quite simply the best low cost indie game ever. Got it free on ps4 bought on a bundle deal on steam. It's so good I felt obliged to buy in game dlc to support the development. Steep learning curve yet easy to get into. It's not football it's not a driving game. It just is and it works. 80 hours in I felt comfortable with air shots 300 in and I'm still not comfortable with ball cam. Just awesome
1;This game is great.you can do sick stuff like ceiling shot double touch redirect etcbut it has flawsif u are bad at competitive you're gonna get all the hate from your teammate (especially solo que)try to get a real friend/real teammate that you play together most of the time.and yes i have a 300 hours of this game... which mean i'm still (my average ranks is Platinum).
1;WOW! Get this game. It's as fun as it looks. If you think it looks fun it's because it is. This game is 100% worth every spent on it and then some. I bought some of the DLC just as a way to give them more money because I feel they deserve it. The sheer amount of content you get with this game is insane. And it's so damn fun. Get it. You won't be disapointed.
1;Love this game but there are serious consistent lag issues that make competitive not worth playing because you're never sure if you're going to have a good connection for that game or not. Rocket league also has one of the most toxic communities I've ever seen besides maybe Dota. This has been addressed a bit with Rumble as it makes it less competitive and that's not really the games fault but it definitely makes it less fun to play.
1;Incredible game with great developers. New content keeps being added for free. I'm perfectly fine with paid DLC cars and the crate system as long as it provides no advantage and it doesn't. The game is incredibly fun for newbies all the way up to the grand champion level.
1;It's a really great game to play with friends! The thing that makes me sad is the community in certain places in this game that makes me look bad or feel bad. There are nice people exist on this game if you're lucky to be matching with them!!! I would prefer getting friends and play this game together for some and giggles with custom games. Ranked is something that i'll shall never say. It's a bloody circus! It's okay but not perfect. BUY THIS GAME ALREADY.
1;I like carball Who doesn't like carballWhat other game could be made an E Sport 3 days into launch?Do you own this game? if you said no then where are you and why is it not earth.Another questionWho is your favorite character from friends and why is it Phoebe?
1;I dont know why everyone complains about matchmaking. You cant expect developers to hold your hand. If people you play against are better than you then what does that mean.. Get better. Its not hard and this game is fun AF. Highly recommend. Graphics and music are incredible. Gameplay superb. Cusomization is perfect.
1;Product received for free. Stop reading this you are wasting your time buy this ing game.Picked this bad boy up along with my Steam Controller not expecting much (better played with an Xbox One controller) but this game blows Mario Kart out of the water.
1;"""Lots of customization options unbelievably fun gameplay and Splitscreen for up to 4 Players. Price seemed high but i get it now.The Dlc is appearance only all cars drive the same speed and handling is identical. Only difference is the Hitbox (car body) which affects your """"shots"""". Yes you do shoot. Soccer Hoops and other fun modes involving a ball and high powered rocket cars that doublejump. Sometimes involving items Of course.Heavily recommended."""
1;Best game since cars met football my friend with who i play with is an xD UNFAIR CRATE DROPS i dont like car games or football games but somehow i still love this kind of cheap DLCs that come with more content10/10 would rage that i lose a promotion again
1;"""""""Cross platform play isn't allowed by some players on this sever"""" No I'm one of those players. Quit trying to connect me to servers that do allow it. Also it shouldn't take almost max connection time to find a server with over 13k people in that playlist. Fix it."""
1;"""Can't stop. Won't Stop.""""This dude keeps ramming me from behind"""" High skill cap but don't have to be good to have fun. Car customizations add variety to your """"own character"""" and represent what you want them too.Getting tired of this review. Off to play rocket lea.."""
1;Do you hate soccer/football but love cars or vice versa or both! Then this is the game for you. The last time I played a match with a veteran I no scoped him and scored 7 goals.11/10 IGN would no scope again. P.S. I know this IGN thing is becoming too mainstream but deal with it.
1;Got this game a few months ago and returned it because people with controllers have a bigger advantage over people with keyboards. Went out and bought a controller a couple days ago and have been having a blast so far... I do have the game on the PS4 but switching to PC on a 144hz refresh rate makes all the difference compared to the consoles.i7 4790k 4.4GHz16GB DDR3 1600MHzGTX 1080 FTW edition out of box clocksMy 1080 does not break a sweat.
1;Probably the best game I've ever played in many different ways. I didn't imagine I loved the idea of cars and soccer mixed up in one game but now after 100 hours I am completely sold. Amazing graphics physics that feels real even though flying cars might seem weird at a first glance. Easily a 10/10.
1;Cars? Check.Soccer? Check.Short matches that don't make you want to kill yourself because you're getting your beat and don't want to wait 10 minutes for it to be over? Check.This game is a blast. I don't play it as much as I should which almost makes it better. Bored with what you're doing? Pop Rocket league on smash into balls and cars for a while and move on.
1;Rocket League is the best! Found it out PSN and played well over a 100 hrs. Now on my PC addition I'm having a blast! Ranking is putting me with other Masters and Experts even tho im a Semi Pro. It some how can tell my skill range and puts me up against some good competition. RL!
1;After about 300 hrs on record I can say that this is probably the game that has gotten me the madest ever. I'm not saying this in a bad way I just get so in the moment and competitive I get really angry. I would recomend this game to anyone that doesn't have anger issues otherwise you may be needing a new monitor.
1;I think this is one of the best game ever made in the world because in every single update psyonix are giving us new modes crates stadiums items cars and more....One thing thats psyonix should change is this banning stupid things i didnt speak once in chat for 20 games and i got banned for being TOXIC if they fix this without any doubt best game i played ever.
1;Gameplay is great graphics are nice and the server problems seem to be sorted out for the most part. This is the most fun I've had with a new game in years and even worth writing a review which I never do. Think of this as 11/10. Well worth the full price.
1;rocket league is a fun addicting game however the cummnity from what ive seen is toxic and banning is unfair you can get banned for no reason for three days for vulgar languge meanwhile my friend spoke more then i did good game but banning system is bad
1;Rocket League is one of the best games i have played in my life this game is specially for those who love cars and have interest in football or basketball.Its fun to play this game with friends but in pakistan pings are too high in which makes pakistani players unhappy.I would surely recommend this game!!!! )
1;Nothing special...a game to play when you want have a spare 15 mins before bed...and then you're still playing it at 4am...a week later...and everyone you loved has left you...but it's ok...you don't miss them anyway...cause you're still playing this game.
1;Great Multiplayer title for little money.DLC is only for bling bling effect you don't need to 'buy to git gud'The Community can be toxic during ranked matches but overall the games are fun and tense.Pretty easy to learn and you improve while just plaing no need for boring training. Has enough variaty to keep you entertained 200+ h
1;This game is really fun! Pysonix are really good creators and listen to there fans to what needs to be added and or fixed. I have nearly 200 hours on this. One thing i will say is that the rocket league community has gotten alot more harsh. Other than that its a great game! I Recommand buying it
1;One of the best games i have in my steam library!i know people have bad luck with crates (me) but the skins and special boosts/toppers etc are not needed to experience a great game like this one which still has loads of great potential for the futurefu*k fifa and all other football games buy this unique 'car football' game and experience the HYPE for yourself even if you dont have any crates or money to buy keys the game is STILL a great hit for steam
1;One of my favorite games on and completely worth the money. I got so many hours worth of entertainment out of this game and it never gets old. Grab a copy of this game with your friends or make some new ones online DSavage!Savage!Savage!Chat disabled to 4 seconds.
1;I think it would be a great idea of the developement team automatically filled slots in ranked solo 3s. Its very toxic for a player to leave in a solo ranked 3s and leave their team at an unfair disadventage leaving for the ranked game to favor one team over the other beacuse of the irreplaceable player.support this thread if you agree with this statement.
1;I thought the idea of Remote Control cars playing football was a cool idea but was hesitant to buy Rocket League in case it would just be a novelty game. No.This game has rapidly become my favourite game of all time. It is fun from the novice stage up to late game progression...buy it!!!!
1;Soccer meets rocket cars in a highly a addictive one of a kind gaming experience. Solid controls tons of customization and hugely satisfying gameplay. Simple to learn and play for the casual gamer but with a skill ceiling high enough to keep players interested for a long time. You won't be disappointed with this game.
1;One of the best games of it's time. It is a mix of some of my favorite things (Soccer and cars and explosions) It is resource intensve which slows down some computers. I have a powerful computer so it runs fine. It's a good game. Reccomend for it's sale price.
1;This is a very enjoyable game. It is simple and can be fun for everyone. Easy to grasp how to play but as others have said hard to master. You can have amazing interactions with other players. More often than not though the people you will meet will be absolute asshats. This is not to say that everyone you meet will be a complete bastard but the population of those who play this game is saturated with such people. All things considered Rocket League is a game worth having.
1;Absolutely amazing. This game is everything I imagined it would be and more. If you like competitive games but still want to be able to mess around once in a while you'll love it. There's no possible way I could be happier with my purchase even 935 hours in. If you're on the fence go for it.
1;This game got it all. Easy controls. A great community ( tho after the last sale a lot a salty Lol/csgo players have joined)fantastic graphicsOne of the best customization system i have ever seen.many different maps to play.18 different cars to choose between.THERE IS ACTALLY CROSSPLAY WITH THE CONSOLES WOAH WOAH WOAH15/10 What a save!!
1;It is easy to pickup and quick to become good enough to have fun. However it takes much much longer to master. Playing with friends makes the experience much better as even the most basic communication will put you ahead of your competition.The developer is one of the best in the business with regular updates free content and user feedback. This should be a staple in any multiplayer library.Well played!
1;I hate racing games and I hate sports games.Cars suck soccer sucks having to deal with players on your team sucks.Having to play ranked to feel good about yourself sucks.Playing hours on end to go from trash to garbage at a game sucks.This is the greatest game i've ever played and none of those complaints apply to it.Rocket League does not suck
1;I've been playing it for 2 weeks. It's been ultra fun from day 1 and I can see how skillful best players are I'm going to play this game for a looooong time. There is just enough luck in this game to create awesome moments but not too much so it's too random.Cool thing is you can play short or long sessions fun or serious.Cherry on the cake the editors are pushing many updates. P E R F E C T
1;I don't usually post reviews and I almost never play multiplayer and I NEVER play sports multiplayer and having said that...THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN!I swear at the computer and my girlfriend thinks I'm nuts but I keep going back for more. So much fun and if you haven't tried it you have to you won't regret it.
1;Pro Quick Fix To Rage Quitters + PS2/PC Integrated + Rockets Cars + Graphics + Free Rumble ModeCon DLC + Unlock KeysI wish there was a way to go back to playing against new players and rookies that way when I try to introduce this game to a friend he does not have to play against experts!This game is much better than it looks!
1;Amazing game but not recommended for people with low FPS because you will need to lower the quality settings to make it better I have bought the game of the year edition it came with few amazing things I really liked it 10/10. Do not buy it on consoles because it will cost you money to play online this is better!
1;"""Ridiculously addicting game. No matter what happens you keep wanting to come back for more punishment. Probably one of the few """"sports"""" games I can actually play for hours on end. From a value perspective I've more than earned my money back just by the sheer amount of time I've spent in the game. If you're thinking about pulling the trigger just do it already."""
1;If you want a quick and competitive match this game is for you. Each and every match is different even though you play mostly in the same setup. Getting that Aerial goal and that epic saves is a reward all on it's own. This game is a must have. You'll study crazy stunts as you see other do it easy as cake. IT WON'T BE EASY AND IT WILL TAKE TIME. But it will be amazing once you are able to do stunts you thought was impossible. It's a crazy game.
1;When I first heard of this game I thought it sounded really stupid. I then played it. My first experience playing it was couch multiplayer which is absolutely the way to go but if you can't do that hop in a voice chat with a couple of friends and you'll realize hours later how much time has actually passed. There's years of skill building potential here and you'll get more than your money's worth out of this game.
1;More fun than you might initially think.When i first heard about thsi game i thought it was dumb. Soccer doesn't interest me cars don't interest me this is just a combination of things i don't care about.But this game has so many layers of strategy! I discover new ones every third or fourth session! New little ways i could improve my game. And this game is really fun to get good at.
1;Amazing music. 10/10 would rate again.Gameplay is super awesome as well. 10/10 Would rate again. Easy to learn 10/10 would rate again. I just really like this game. 10/10. Lost a couple rounds. 10/10. This game is beyond impressive. 10/10. Love the graphics of this game. 10/10Final rating. 10/10.Would play again.
1;Rocket League is jam packed with loads of fun and it is a must for any lover of cars and/ or racing. As an avid football fan it provides me with an excellent blend of action and replayability. It takes just a few minutes to grasp the basics but takes much longer to master. I currently have 30+ hours stacked up in about three weeks and I still enter each match with the same enthusiasm as my first game.Rocket League is an all round great experience.
1;This is definitely my favorite game just because i've had it for such a long time and played it so much but still have just as much fun if not more when im playing it. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone thinking about buying it because it is well worth the cost.
1;You know I liked this game....... UNTIL IT DECIDED NOT TO WANT TO LAUNCH! I've even deleted the game and reinstalled it! It's making me so mad. idek whats not letting it launch. i cant even get a refund from steam because i had too much time put into it. So yea 20$ down the drain. If you would could you please find a solution for this problem and tell me how to fix it. &gt /
1;"""They really need to implement some sort of check when you're being disconnected because of the servers. I am tired of waiting 15 minutes because you have network issues. Also If you're looking for a real good competitive scene... Ranks until Challenger Elite are what you would call ELO hell... with all of those players """"having fun"""" trolling your competitive game."""
1;This game is super addicting! Perfect combination of FIFA and Flat out. Graphics are bright and flashy plus there is a plethora of personalization when it come to the vehicles. I play with an Xbox controller through an adapter to my PC. Grab your friends and have a blast!
1;Fantastic game dont need to say anything more to that ... technically great and the gameplay works fast and fluid!Previously I had a lot of complaints about the ranking system but they changed it ! They pretty much just took the ranks and made them lower and I dont know if its the perfect solution but I like it how it is right now and I am enjoying the game right now. GJ Psyonix
1;When you have over 400 hours of gameplay and are still not even slightly bored you know that this game is the game of all games. For most people this game is fun and you play for a bit then stop but if you get into it you get good. You get better. You sweat and hardcore grind until you are pulling off insane shots that tickle your insides. I rate this game dank/10 because it made me quit every other game i play. Psyonix #1!
1;This game is fun but often reppetitive to the point that it's boring. If you download it for season mode there is really nothing there besides wasting 4 hours of your life. While this game is a good time passer it is not a very good game to spend the 0$ on.
1;It starts very slow in the beginning but once you spend the first initial hours getting used to the controls you will get addicted. Trust me.On top of that there is a very cool trading system including crates and items that vary in rarity and opening crates is very fun.+1
1;Get this game if You like soccer. You like doing tricks/stunts. You like Rocket Powered Cards that play with a gigantic soccer ball. You like short games (Games are only 5 minutes long) so you can literally play when you get a brief moment. You like having fun.
1;An awesome and bery intresting game!i really love this game of it's unique game style. it's really like Fifa however it's so much more fun and teamwork. playing with friends makes the whole game even better so tag along with your friends and play this f*cking awesome game!hope this helped you to decide to buy it!also check out the DLC's! they are really worth the credits!
1;anyone having start up issues? I got a i3 6110 Evga nvidia 960 2gb and 8gb ram. When launches works fine but I belive the recent nvidia update has affected the game. Although it starts up fine on my 2nd gen i5 2450m laptop with 4gb ram and intel 3000 graphics
1;Loving the game really hard but can't recommend playing competitive games. Why? Even though this game is kinda the best Car racing ball kicking Game leavers in competitive off hard. After 5 minutes of dealing alone rocket league sadly didn't manage to give me a partner. afterwards getting downranked is just the top. Please care more about the left ones in the competitive hoping you read this and keep up the good work
1;Rocket League is a nice game for people who want to play football with cars but its more complex then that. If you want to play it you should try it out with a friend or someone else atleast someone you can play and talk with because playing with randoms is not a good idea
1;Game is good . I really like rocket league . But after your new map aquadome I started to hate it . Many people like me have to play it in 5 fps . I'm so sick of losing my ranked points because of 5 fps map . PLEASE FIND A SOLUTION FOR IT . Let us choose the map or remove it from ranked . If you don't find a solution I won't play anymore .
1;Great game way too underpriced. Huge learning curve but fun at all skill levels. No unfair disadvantages as DLC is cosmetic only. They release free maps all the time.I've continued to support the game by buying DLC and keys because it is truly one of the greats.
1;This game is amazing i think its one of my favourite games i've owned althogh racing type a games arent the ones im most keen on!Overall i think its a great game defenatly get it if ur looking 4 game that u r willing to spend some money on.I also love the features of additional vehicles and crates.
1;"""Amazing game truly fun even if you are terrible. It's hilarious to watch all 8 people in a match of Chaos miss the ball.It does have its downsides crates that require premium keys and car """"DLC"""" packs coming out of your ears so if you're against that that might trigger you. I personally don't mind it because I paid 15 for it the third of the price of the usual new release.Very addictive and you will lose hours in this if you can see past the football elements if you're not a football fan."""
1;Awesome game! But one MAJOR flaw in matches Your team could be doing pretty good and the opposing team members are quitting from frustration but then new players join and take the win from your team. They should just make the teams forfeit if all the players quit.
1;This Game is FAAAABULOUS exciting interesting requires not only luck but training game sense and humour! D Recommend it for everybody but keep in mind when u play first go with bots and play season until u can win against all star bots only then go for training! Train until u make 100% on pro level in every training type. AND ONLY NOW can u play online! Thanks in the name of the community have fun! D
1;"""Great game. Very fun competitive and alot of things to learn.You can try to get good at the game and focus on getting better or just about with a bunch of friends whilst having the time of your lives.Suffers from the """"just five more minutes"""" syndrome."""
1;One of the most fun multiplayer games to be experienced on any platform. Matchmaking is superb and local multiplayer on PC works flawlessly as long as you have two controllers.I don't even particularly like soccer or cars. But I love Rocket League to death. Even better with friends.
1;This is the definition of a real game! It's fun worthy of E Sports competitions easy to learn but hard to master with physics based gameplay. I have never played a game so fun in my life and felt a sports like thrill and adrenaline filled sense of challenge! It supports cross platform online play and splitscreen. The music is also really good. &gt 60Hz support is available in single digit increments so any framerate cap up to 250FPS is possible.
1;Rocket League is like an onion it has so many layers of gameplayer and challenge and everytime you play you will probably cry. But in all seriousness this is a game that was ressurected by an amazing studio and given new life through the opportunity of Esports. This is a game that you will love and hate but the one thing you cant say about it is that it is poorly made. This game is solid and for a game made in Unity it is impressive.
1;100+ Hrs on it I have to say overall it's just a great game and it hasn't lost its charm over this past year.It's just one of those games where you can just keep coming back and never get bored.New match anything can happen win/lose Rince and Repeat Nice Shot! Great Pass! Thanks!
1;Really nice game. It's good when u play solo but it's REALLY GOOD (AWESOME) when u play with friends &lt 3Pluses +good graphics+really nice soundtrack+good idea+short matches+many options of customizing ur car+good psychics+easy to start hard to master+easy rule SHOTMinuses sometimes u can rage no punishment for players abandoning a match without friends this game can be boring after one hour NOTHING ELSESorry for all mistakes!
1;Rocket League is a fresh and unique experience best enjoyed in the company of your friends. The neverending excitement you can get from competing online in unparalleled. Seemingly simplistic at first you'll soon realise that your gameplay can be taken to a whole new level with a bit of fine tuning and a lot of practice. Truly a phenomenal game.
1;So I have around 70 80 hours of playing by the time I'm writing this and listen closely...This is the least frustrating game I have played in my life it's so hard to master but not in abad way the only con of this game is the matchmaking I just ranked up to veteran and I don't know what I'm facing more rookies or rocketeers (max rank) which is annoying but I can get use to it this game is amazing and I guarantee that you will not regret buying this game
1;What an amazing game! It's such a simple idea but it's executed perfectly. Not only is the game great but so are the devs. Any DLC they have put out (which I've been more than happy to buy each and every one) is pretty much all just cosmetic additions. Definitely one of my favorite games of 2015. You will not regret getting it!
1;This game may seem silly and not worth trying at a glance. But It is a ton of fun. You get into the action literally right away and the matches are short. You can play with friends together or against one another or just join an existing game with other random people online. It's socer/football with Cars (RC Cars).. the idea works though. There is a hockey mode as well. Definitely worth the moeny.
1;Incredibly unique game that is also very fun and competitive. It has a decent learning curve and the skill level from the playerbase continues to increase. The devs are very responsive and are constantly making free updates and game modes. If you like video games and sports you'll love this game. Highly recommend.
1;I bought this gamea year ago played 1 or 2 games then left it alone. My friend reccently got into it and encouraged me o play and wow the game is a lot deeper than originally thought it was (I though it was hitting the ball not Pinch Shots Aerials Wall to Air Dribbles etc.) 10/10 for graphics gameplay and community.
1;"""When I first started playing Rocket League I was satisfied just knocking the ball around on the ground and messing around with my friends. Now I'm 100 hours in and the game now has a vertical aspect to it and it's still just as fun as when I first got it.It's the only game apart from Civ where I have had to alt F4 the program because I just couldn't stop playing. The old saying in Civ """"One more turn"""" is just as relevant in RL."""
1;With a simple premise and straight forward controlls Rocket league is a game that anybody can pick up but it takes time and skill to master. Rounds are only 5min so it is a great game to play if you have a limited amount of time to spare. Once you get the hang of it ariels bring the game to another level. This is a game that anyone can enjoy whether you are a person new to games or a hardcore veteran Rocket League has a place for you.
1;Amazing amounts of fun in a game with such a simple concept. if you want to get as much as you can out of this game don't take it seriously and play the game because its CAR SOCCER and thats awesome! I accepted the fact i cant go pro so I play for fun. This mentality got me to Diamond 3. This game is a NEED TO HAVE if you play video games. It is quickly becoming a pillar in the online gaming community.
1;Non stop four wheeled action. Matches are super enjoyable and overtimes are painful as hell. You ll enjoy it even if you don t like football (or sports for that matter). Paid DLC are purely cosmetic Solo play (season) is enjoyable. Full controller support (necessary to unlock your full potential at this game)No brainer. You ll be instantly hooked for weeks.
1;I consistently come back to play this game more than any other. It never stops being fun. The community can get fairly toxic but I honestly don't know of any competitive online games where this isn't an issue. Is it a PERFECT game? Yes yes it is. Buy it.
1;started playing with some friends and slowly got very addicted to the game as i became more advanced with the game mechanics. Id easily lose track of time thinking... its only 5 more minutes for a game.. then realizing i have been playing for 3 6 hours straight.Allways fun to play and just relax with friends definitely worth the money. Would recommend to pick it up especially if u got friends u wanna try it out with D
1;You love car's &gt GoodYou love footbal &gt GoodCombine this together and you get Rocket League.No kidding this game it's awseom. You will get a lot of fun. As you progress in gameplay and become better and better the game will become even beter. Then discover freestayl... D.
1;Rocket League is a very well though out game with great gameplay very personalized and good graphics.The concept is simple what if you mixed Soccer with demolition derbys well you'd get Rocket League. When you first start to play the game it may seem difficult at first. But once get comfortable with the controls and sink some hours into it the game starts becoming fun.8/10
1;I was sceptical at first about this game. Then a friend conviced me to buy it and i can not believe how good it feels to play! It is one of those games that looks a bit silly when you first see it but when you play it it feels so good. I will say this however you need a controller to play this game (I use 360) because playing on kb and mouse will make you sick ) Just buy it!
1;Sharp mechanics rocket powered cars and overly sarcastic teammates. Can't get much better than that. But for real the multiplayer experience is a frustrating yet super satisfying set of trials in which you learn to hit the ball from the ground wall mid air and anywhere else you can imagine. At 150 hours I feel that my rocketeering powers have only just begun to develop.10.0/10.0
1;Dope AF10/10 would 10/10 again.Seriously this game is sick. It's hard to master at first and you press the wrong buttons all the time at the start of your Rocket League Career (cringey ik don't hate) but once you get it going you start doing sick shots like aerials and aerial goals and freestyle goals and then you feel like a god. If you're looking to buy and you're not sure trust me you won't regret spending a few bucks on this game.
1;Easy to learn absolutely difficult to master this is a game that will actually have you bragging about your replays and saving them to show off. Experience cliches such as taking it one game at a time it's a game of (one) half don't try and walk it in yeah nah it's a team effort and so on. Highly recommended you'll clock up 100 hours before you even know it.
1;Play by yourself Play with friends Play at 4am or at 12pm eating lunch. Play hard Play Bad and blame it on anything but pure mistake. Play with people 1000+ hours more than you and still crush them. Play with people 1000+ hours more than you and get crushed by them. Play around in the garage creating the ultimate car. Play on a server other than oceanic and prepare to get railed by lag spikes. Play Rocket League.Can not recommend this game enough.
1;If you're contemplating buying this game stop.Just buy it. You won't regret it. You have my word.In case you do regret it unplug your computer and throw it through your window. Because if you regret getting Rocket Leauge your life is a sham.Have a blessed day.
1;"""At first i had no idea why I had even purchased this game. I didn't really grasp the mechanics of it that easily. Soccer with cars? I thought this game was really overrated to be having people play more than 100 hours on it.Boy was I wrong.The best way I could describe this game now is the phrase """"only a few more minutes"""".Totally recommend you need it ASAP!"""
1;This game is super fun to mess around with you learn as you go there are thousands of tutorials on how to advance your skill but the servers are not good right now they constantly rubber band and with all the inevitable kids buying or getting this for christmas its only going to get worse fun with friends messing around with mutator settings in private matches i would reccomend but not for the online play ability
1;Product received for free. Well I'm going to go ahead add to the postive hype that surrounds this title. If you love Competitive Multiplayer games and this isnt already in your library its a must. Easily my most played game! P.S. Get yourself a controller and it may just be the biggest game changer you can do for yourselfDont be discouraged fyi. RL is easy to grasp. Tough to master. GLHF
1;"""A great game where a player's skill not time or money determine their ability. Constant updates keep the game fresh and interesting by creating new modes of play that force even the most expect players to adjust their playstyle. My pick for the """"Just 5 More Minutes"""" award despite saying that to myself over two hours ago.P.S. Please put the Utopia Retro map back into the online Rocket Labs Lineup."""
1;There are very few games that will cause me to lose track of time to the point where it isn't until the sun starts to rise that I realized I spent all night telling myself... just one more game. Rocket League is truly great and one of the best multiplayer games of recent years.
1;I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THE GAME....... but the devs need to do a few things with the maps and the game.1) EITHER remove aqua dome AND neo tokyo from competetive OR add a map select for whether or not we want to play on certain maps2) the map selection idea but with casual3) add another aerial tutorial but for air dribbling in different ways
1;This game is the definition of crack. You say you can stop anytime but you keep coming back. Its like a drug. The gameplay is very fun even without friends. There is also a competitive side where you can continue to improve and climb the ranks. There are also goofy gamemodes like hoops and hockey. I would definitely reccomend picking it up.
1;The skill ceiling can be pretty high but once you get a hang of this game it's super fun. It can be funny dissapointing frustrating fun and super rewarding. I defenitly suggest this game but make sure you have a controller. Nearly impossible with a Keyboard + Mouse.
1;The latest sensation that's sweeping the nation.Rocket League the game where you play soccer....as a car!Truckloads of fun even more truckloads if you play with friends.Highly recommend using a controller makes the gameplay much easier to pick up.Did I mention it has splitscreen support?
1;This game is very fun and easily playable. At first i thought the controls would be hard and would't work well but i got the hang of it really quik I suggest playing with atleast one friend as this may get repetative and boring. The custamization is great with a few cars decals and lots of hats and atenas to mix and match and 1v1 up to 4v4 I have to say that there arn't any mini games or taces which would be a great update idea but still a good fun game especialy if its on sale.
1;I don't personally love such games but this game is really really fun and worth the try. Be patient and watch to learn from others how to play. Get a controller (PS3 controller will work with the correct programs) Get friends to play it with you.Even if you don't know what the u're doing ITS FUN. But the more you know it the more you love it.10/10
1;I think the new upgrade gives to the game strange rank staffs. Ranks open after 10 games and ranks do not change after 3 games more (I only play 13 games). Maybe it can be changed after 10 games more i don't know but the game should show me how much game remains for changing the division. As a result I do not like the new upgrade. Ranks can be hidden for first 10 games ok but if your division point is changed out of 100 should be shown after every game like previous upgrade.
1;This is a realy good game. It is a lot of fun. You notice right of the bat that it is not your character that haze to gett better but you have to. This means that it takes a lot of time to get good. If you have the time by it no cestion. if you do not but you do have frends its a lot of fun playing whith srubs against srucbs so. take a look and if you realy hat it you can use the steam refund feture so by it and take a look.sorry for my bad grammer and spelling.
1;Do you like games with cars? Do you just love soccer games? Me neither. I'm not really a fan of either but this game... this ing game just joins them together in such a way in which the result is much more than the sum of its parts. It's just a fun game that brings out everyones competitive side.
1;It seem easy game but it's not. It may seem stupid but well actually it is stupid and funny. Every game you learn something new new tactic new trick new tip. It's so funny to play with your friends but even alone. I would suggest it to someone who likes Funny Multiplayer games and no even if you don't like Cars or Soccer you will love this game!!!
1;I love Rocket League even the days where I solo queue and end up hating myself. The community is like any other multiplayer community some good some bad mostly neutral. Psyonix does a lot for their customers and have put out a great product. Even though I'll never be good enough at the rocket car game I'll always hold it in my heart.
1;This game is fantastic if you're looking for a simple game that you can start up almost instantly and get a few quick rounds in this should definitely be in your steam library. Psyonix has also been supporting the game well post release keeping it somewhat fresh.
1;Amazing game to play with friends or alone. The learning curve is great At start is funny as hell as you miss most of the hits on a funny way but then you start learning new things and improving constantly. I never noticed as well as in this game how I was better than before once every a few hours.My favorite game ATM and probably the one on which I have spent more hours since I was 10 and was addict to Age of Empires 2 or maybe Sims 1.
1;In my twenty plus years of gaming there have been very few games that have captivated me as much as Rocket League. Psyonix is one of the best developers out there right now and it's amazing to see how this game continues to evolve in so many ways. I can't say enough good things about this game. If you don't own it already what are you doing?
1;I've had this game for a while now and after 400 hours of playing this is definitely a must buy game. The devs clearly listen to their player base and have constantly worked on new things that make the game enjoyable. I love how their is a high skill ceiling but at the same time the game itself is just fun. It's just cars that hit a ball around and it's hard to take too seriously.
1;This game is great. To get started is very simple but to get to the more advanced techniques takes time and commitment and feels really good when you nail it after a few days of practice.It's a simple concept but very well executed and quickly became my most played game!
1;This game is extremely fun. The mechanics in this game are pretty difficult at first but once you get the hang of it you'll find yourself scoring amazing shots. The physics in the game are kind of broken but you get used to it and soon start understanding it better so it isn't really a problem. 10/10 would recommend to everyone. ONLY FUN IF YOUR COMPUTER CAN HANDLE ALL THE MAPS!! Some people get serious frame drops on certain maps.
1;Great game and extreemly fun. the only thing I find wrong about this game is that there are loads of self absorbed 12 year olds playing competitive that cant blame anything on themselves. However that is not the games fault so I cant hold it against the game. Overall I would recomend the game to anyone
1;I usually only play single player games but I was convinced to buy this during the summer sale. It's so addicting I had to hide my controller from myself for a week so that I could get work done. There are a lot of things that make this game addicting leveling up ranking up the item drop system loot crates trading and the passive agressive autochat features. It's also pretty cool that PC and PS players play on the same servers widening the match pool.
1;Do you like games with friends? Do you enjoy zipping around in an enclosed space to your hearts content? Do you like blowing up people that ruin that PERFECT SHOT?!Yes? Play Rocket League. Hands down (unless I'm playing) the most fun I have had in a very long time.
1;So this game is somewhat an addiction. It's really easy to get good at it and then you realize what you once thought was good is not good at all anymore.If you are competitive this game will be hard to put down.Even without being competitive this game is fairly addicting.If you don't like playing sports games too bad buy it anyway.I only have one request I want a 'Boop!' shortcut for chat.Nice Shot!Great Pass!
1;Oh boy this game is great amzing fun I have playing Rocket League. One poor thing is the players who you play with. Sometimes the can't handle the imaginative pressure of casual game and start toxic chat. Thanks for the mute option. Also thanks for the trading cards I sold them for quite decent amount of money!
1;This game...It is one of the greatest I have ever seen (and I mean that!)Even if you HATE cars and football I can guarantee you will love every moment.Scoring an ariel can make you feel like a god and it is one of the best feelings you will ever experience.
1;Great game. Basically soccer with cars. I have over 100 hrs in this game and it keeps me coming back. If you are looking for a game that you can play for a few minutes have some mindless fun and continue on with your day...this is it. If you are looking to lose a couple of hours in a game in fierce competition this game can keep you occupied. Developers are active and involved with the community. The paid DLC is a few bucks a pop and the game is updated with free content often.
1;I love this game. Very frustrating to start but it just gets better and better.And frustrating. I'm still trying to learn how to hit balls out of mid air in Aerial and I apparently have almost 60 hours played at the time of the review.Oh well much fun and madness strogly recommended.
1;To this point I have played Rocket League over 400 hours and I can tell I'm never going to get tired of it. Its great to play it on your own its superb when you play it with friends and it is great to fulfill your competitive necessities. I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a great time.
1;Rocket League will be remembered the same way Super Smash Bros. and Star Wars Battlefront II will be. It's that fun that addicting and that intuitive to pick up and play. And like Smash Bros there's a whole world of competitive skill and strategy unnecessary to enjoy the ame mind you for those who want a little extra kick out of the game.An absolute must buy for every gamer.
1;This game has brought me to my absolut breaking point I'v uninstalled it twice managed to break more controllers and headsets playing it and yet for some stange reason I always come back to it. It's like a curse or a disease no matter what happens I still have to play it.10/10 Meh
1;I just keep coming back to this game. It helps that the developers are great and keep adding new content for free. Supported by keys now. Simple to learn hard to master. Rocket League is a great time killer. 10 minutes to kill? I load up a match of rocket league. Still a large player base this long into the game's life. Drive your way to victory with high flying goals.
1;Easy to pick up hard to master nearly 1000 hours and im still learning and trying to get better. Perfect to play with friends and with constant updates from the developers it keeps the game fresh even over a year after launch. Can't recommend this game enoguh.
1;All these hours and I'm still rubbish. I play this when I have 5 or 10 minutes to kill but end up having just one more game each time. It's very addictive and easy to start playing but difficult to be very good.I am always late to things now. I have missed a lot of trains because of this game. Many dinners have gone cold.
1;Hundreds of hours of fun. Simple to understand and easy to learn yet deep gameplay and hard to master. Good graphics rocking soundtrack respectable netcode esports friendly passionate community. Psyonix caught definately caught me off gaurd with how good this game turned out to be. And they're still adding tons of new free content and features. Rocket League represents video games in their purest form.
1;"""This game literally is me saying after a match """"OK just one more match."""" every single time. Considering that each match is 5 minutes long this game fits perfectly into the 5 More Minutes Award.Very fun game that is competetive challenging and approachable. You can literally just hop on for a few minutes to play a match or two or you could make your butt go numb and hone your aerial hit skills for a while. I highly recommend this game if you don't have it already."""
1;Rocket League is an incredibly fun and addictive game. It is an easy to get into game with a simple concept and massive skill curve. It is great fun to play alone but even greater fun to play with friends.And I mean it's soccer with cars that can fly. What's not to love!
1;For some reason my rocket league won't save correctly i'll change the setting all I want... And the game sets it to default when I relog in. I can't even edit my car . I got Ara 51 the foam hat and another decal and every time I log in I have Zomba wheels I can't change my wheels or anything and trust the game that it's going to save. I still recomend this game because it's very fun and all just some one pls tell me how to fix this... Thanks.
1;The game idea is pretty simple but Psyonix really made it an awesome experience.You can either play it just for fun or really get into it and play it competitive.The matches take 5 10 minutes depending on how many goals are scored but either isn't too long so you can play it whenever you have a few minutes spare time.Solid 9/10
1;I just I've played few hours and got addicted instantly.Very fun game highly recommended.Just a thing to addSTOP ING MAKING US DOWNLOAD 0.8 1 GB of DLC when we can't play it if you didn't buy it it's pretty anoying srsly.Don't make us download DLC unless we bought it that's the only thing is annoying me.
1;When I started playing this game I was never a huge fan of it. My brother told me to play more often so I came back and started to gain some skill. The car customization options are almose limitless from antennas to paint materials. My only issue is that the cars have different hitboxes so I don't always get to pick the car that looks the best. Besides that this game is almost perfect. Highly reccommended for anyone.Also use a controller before you get used to using a keyboard and mouse.
1;Probably the most unlikely combo for me to like cars and fotball. Yet it has become one of my most played games! It is very addictive and easy to learn but if you strive for the higher ranks alot of training is needed. A fun way to test your skills further than playing ranked is to join tournaments much recommended!
1;Takes about 150 400hours to really get good at the game like gold level to plat level. I recommend keyboard and mouse on this game because if you play with remote in my opinion it s much harder and the max I got to was silver gold. Thanks for reading! Go for remote if you think your better at it!
1;Super fun!! Had lots of fun learning the game and watching advanced players play is super inspiring to only play it some more. ONLY EXCEPTION is to find a team to play with because most random people don't listen to your callouts/aren't a team player. 11/10
1;Rocket League is one of the best indie games I've ever played. It's a very fast paced competitive game that's fun for everyone. It offers a great selection of game modes including Rocket Labs competitive and Snow Day. The customization options for the cars are awesome. It has a great soundtrack. I would totally recommend this to anyone who likes sports and cars.
1;Only some problems have solutions Not a fan of the music turned it off.Not a fan of the gambling mechanic to win car customization items I don't buy keys.I own this game on steam and ps4 with plans of owning on other platforms Hopelessly addicted to the gameplay.2 outta 3 ain't bad
1;"""This is a game when it comes to map choices. You have the option to """"Like"""" and """"Dislike"""" maps but Psyonix decides to ignore the fact that you did. Dear Psyonix can you give us the power to choose our maps instead of getting us ing Hotwheels updates fix your game. Stay Frosty Icey"""
1;I love this game. Ever since I bought it i've been enjoying this game a lot. I already have almost 1200 hours in it but I keep enjoying it. Sometimes something unlucky happens but if you get a game for this price and constantly get new maps new cars and new custimizables for your car you cant really complain.
1;"""Game is almost unplayable on my 15"""" MacBook Pro Retina at lowest res/settings I get 15 35FPS depending on the map/game mode. On the few maps that I'm able to play on the game is very fun. It would be hard for me to recommend this game for anyone on a Mac but I would for anyone that has a decent PC."""

1;Mulitplayer/Singleplayer/Rumble Mode/Basketball/Ice Hockey/Training/Workshop Maps/Replays... Doesn't require more paid DLC's/additional content to gain an advantage... SHORTBURSTS of 5 minute gameplay... High skill ceiling but extremely fun to play...
1;It's basically the best game. Fast fun addicting gameplay that is updated pretty frequently. In the first year and a half they've added 4 new game modes included 2 different sports and other modes with wacky maps. New maps are free and the themed cars to go with them are cheap DLC (Under $5 usually)Just do yourself a favor and get the game.
1;Simply... An amazing game where cars and soccer is united in one game. Where cars fly arround the field to score goals and lead your team to victory. There is also more game modes which make your game fun and enjoyable. I really wish to have more time to practice and train myself into the game.I recommend this game for sure!! I like it and you probably too!
1;I like the different graphics and video settings that you can change sometimes when i have them all on quality it laggs but still playable.This game is one of a kind the different ways of playing is unique and people that you can meet can sometimes be bad but ignoring it is best thing to do you can meet new friends and have people to play with I so recommend this game its so fun!
1;It is one of those games where the concept seems so simple and almost boring yet when you play the game it all makes sense. It is literally football (soccer if you're american) with cars that just happens to have rocket boosters at the back of them. It might not be for everyone so you're either gonna just play it for a few hours and then never touch it again or you're gonna play until your controller breaks (mine did).
1;#1 casual game on the market! Haven't felt this good about a racer since Mario Kart. Grab a friend play some co op or go online and compete for the lore of cup crowns and raked devisions. Indoor Soccer with VollyBall sets Basketball dunks Footballs stong headed collisions Set up like 3v3 hockey. Boys and Girls this is truly Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars' Predator especially after the release of Rocket Labs! I recommend purchasing it on sale or with a friend to start.
1;"""Started up a 3 v 3 i spawn furthest back as the goalkeeper. Both teammates veer off and go for boost and let the other team have a free shot at goal. They rip it into the top right corner i failed to save it. For the rest of the game my team spams chat with """"What a save!"""" . 10/10 would have my self esteem lowered again."""
1;"""Best game I have ever played since the days of warcraft 3 and halo 2. EVERYBODY should buy this game. I look at every game I buy after this game as """"not being worth it"""". I just bought rainbow six and don't get me wrong its a pretty good game. But i just doint see the value of the game being there. 20 bucks for an amazingly polished game with such a high skill ceiling. BUY IT."""
1;The best game I played for the past 3 years. Really addicting and fun! I played maybe 180 hrs on xbox plus my time here tbh I bought it twice cause its awesome. IDK what else to say except you should buy it even if u think u wont like it its just so awesome.
1;"""Rocket League is an insanely fun game especially to play with friends and progress along with them.The competitive opportunities are huge eSport is present and the learning curve is huge.Even after hundreds of hours of playtime you wont get tired of it because there's just so much to learn.Rocket League is a must buy for any competitive player out there and is good fun for more """"casual"""" players especially during sales."""
1;By far one of the best games I've played in a long time. With almost 640 hours and counting this game has definitely been worth the price and when on sale even better. Have fun with friends or solo the game continues to be one of the best competative games out there. What a save!
1;Okay so I'm coming up to 2000 hours on this and I've enjoyed it lots. I have subscribed to the idea of crates and believe it is a great idea to pool Prize Money for E Sports. What I don't get is how I can buy 10 keys and get 2 Mummy skins and 2 Spore'd skins within 7 gambles. Still a great game but you guys are fixing the dice!!! And after the Star Wars Battlefront malarky may find this comes back to bite you in the !!
1;Rocket league is the best $19.99 dollars i have ever spent. i have had countless hours of fun and its even better with friends. its sometimes fast pace but its definitly worth it.Pros good graphics Lots of items Lots of customization So many different cars to pick Endless funCons the only i can think of is that the packs/keys are a bit overpriced and that its too hard to get crates.
1;A very nice game but very adictive... Nearly every 2 months there is a new update /w cars dlcs crates etc. Really like this game would recommend to anyone who is looking for a game where u can have a lot of fun /w friends or even alone.Update Getting the EULA everytime i start up RL idk what this bug is but i would like this fixed really not enjoying it when everytime i boot it up i have to confirm the EULA and restore my settings again... Psyonix please help! D
1;Before i owned this game i never thought i would even play it so much or i thought i would eventually get bored but not at all this game is so worth it! And will never get old. I've played endless hours of gameplay and customization is amazing. This is one you are gonna want in your library and not be disappointed.
1;This game is really addicting. I feel like every game is a chance for you to get better. The match length is perfect as it is 5 minutes which is very easy to fit into your schedule. There are plenty of customizations options and a cool drop/crate system. Overall amazing experience for a game. 10/10
1;While a bit ping depentant with a decent connection (and a game controller DO NOT use the mouse/keyboard) this game is nothing short of amazing.When my friends and I play together against others we keep score in rage quits and forfiets. Good times.It doesn't appear to have a skill ceiling. The best players in the game the ones winning tournaments for money are still improving. And inspiring.Yet a new player against opponents of a similar level can still have a GREAT time playing Rocket League.
1;Incredible gameplay. Looks like a silly game at first but as soon as you start a game you realize how complex something so simple can be. Somewhat repetitive gameplay but the feeling of mastering a new maneuver is addicting and will keep you coming back for more.100+ hours and I am still learning
1;This is by far the best game I have ever played. It's skill based so you have to spend a lot of time practicing one thing but once you get good at it it feels so good. Recommend to about anyone whether you want to be a top player or just wanna goof around with friends.
1;One of the best games I've played in 2016. Easy to get into hard to master. Its fun to play for 15 30minutes but be warned its highly addicting and it will consume your time. Developers are great and provide frequent updates. Theres alot of game modes and training options to choose from. Only con for this game is micro transactions but if you dont mind using 2 10 euros extra to support developer then its ok.
1;Rocket League is incredibly unique hilarious and provides endless fun. I remember the first match I played I wasn't exactly sure of what I was doing. I drove around for a while and kicked the ball against the wall. It bounced off and trickled into the other team's goal. We won the game and I have loved the game ever since.
1;I really like this game it is lots of fun to play with friends or just by yourself. The only problem I have with it is that my game keeps having problems. It wont save any progress and it just now started to not launch. It just sits there and loads for 5 minutes.
1;You yes you! I know you're reading this right now trying to find any more reasons to convince yourself to buy this amazing game. Let me tell you this is one of the best games out there at the moment and is worth EVERY single penny. With almost 100 hrs in I don't think I've had a similar experience once!Did you get it yet? Yes?Nice shot!
1;Honestly when I first saw this game on the store i wasn't really impressed. Cars and balls? How could that fit. However once I got in the suprising connection was just addicting. 10/10 would recommend to anyone even if your'e not a fan of football or cars.
1;I never knew that mixing my Pre K level Football skills and my childhood obsession of RC cars would turn out to make me good at a game.8.5/10 Servers are fast games are quick easy to pick up but hard to masterIt's the potato chip of the games. Small and easy to digest but addictive and you can never just have one.
1;This is my favorite game ever. There is always something to get better at but unlike a lot of games its fun from the start. You have to give this game a go. Its freaking amazing. I have a lot more time on my PS4. It works pretty good on mac but theres still some glitches of mac but not too bad.
1;I have never been fond of soccer but this is beyond soccer. It's a new sports. And it's not just a game but raising rank in this game became part of my habit of life. levels are well arranged which you will never get bored of losing all the time or winning all the time.
1;I remeber when this game came out back on the PS3. This game was truly the best car game with soccer developed into it. When I saw this game was coming out a was excited and bought it in a heart beat. Everyone who loved this game back on the PS3 will love this one. Everyone should play this game it is hands the one of my top games.
1;Probably the best actual game to come out in years. Simple enough for anybody to pick up within minutes. Deep enough to keep people playing for hours. I put up hundreds of hours on PS4 before buying the PC version. PC is definitely a superior experience for the game due to easier communication.
1;This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Played nearly 600 hours now and it still keeps on giving and you can keep improving and trying new tricks and you still get that WOW factor when you score that epic aerial goal or complete that killer pass! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!
1;This game is fun and intense you don't need to spend 40 minutes on a single match (only 5 minutes) like in LoL or CS However needs quite some time before getting used to the physics of the game and a lot more time to properly master the cars the flying and all that epic stuff 3
1;Game is stupid fun and pretty good graphics. There's a few maps but they all have the same layout the game is always the same except you can play 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4. You can unlock all of the comsetic content within like 15 hours. There's not much content besides that the game is simple but really a lot of replayable fun. The skill cap is incredibly high some of the videos on youtube are absolutely insane. No brainer purchase if you have a few friends to play with.
1;All the bad reviews are cause of server issues. They're fine now. BUY THIS GAME right meow or get it on PS+ for free this month. Mechanically difficult beautiful to see execution. With comms &amp teammates for ranked this could get REALLY competitive.
1;How can I start... This game is brilliant! It popped out of nowhere and blew everyones minds. If you don't have this game I HIGHLY reccomend you spend $20 for it. It may seem a little pricey but its definetly worth your money.PROS Football with cars??? AWESOME! Very smooth gameplay (Very well optimised) Fast paced and addictiveCONS Why even bother reading these. There are none!BUY THIS GAME NOW!
1;I truly do love everything about this game. A suggestion for Season is that maybe you should include specific player stats to see who was the number one overall player throughout the whole season. Maybe where it shows all the statistics for the teams if you click on that team it takes you deeper into player stats. Just a thought!
1;One of the few games that I find are underpriced. Countless hours of fun is well worth the price tag. Bit of a learning curve to it and the potential skill cap is very high.One of the only games in which I'm willing to give extra money for DLC items just because the base game is so cheap and the developers deserve the money. If you haven't played this yet then pick it up and try it.
1;good game to waste time and everytime i play i learn something fun. but random crate drops me off there is no drop rate for crates. items ill play one day for 2 hour get no items but 6 crates but the next day for 2 hour ill get a crap ton on items and no crate. but still a fun game altogther and a good game with friends and alone.
1;First 100 hours wow football with cars wow I have rocket boost wow I can collect customizables for my car spends 20/100 hours customizing and admiring his carAfter that OMG I CAN FLY!! &gt proceeds perfecting his flying skills so he can hopefully join a circus some dayTL DR This game is a blast you have to give it a try.
1;"""This game was fun from the start. Although it comes with some simple concepts It keeps you in interested as you are presented with more and more """"level of masteries"""" that you can achieve over the course the time. Now with its market update you can even go wild on customization to look like a real pro."""
1;Basically rocket powered card playing soccer (football)Lost count of how many goals I've scored for the other teamLost count of how many shots I've missedPlayed only 6 hours and is still a Semi Pro (Can't imagine how long it takes to get Veteran rank)(edit Expert rank now and at 300 hours! xD)Never imagined i would play any video game for this long and still want to play it again and more and never really get bored of it.This game is allover hard to learn and hard to master11/10.

1;I strongly recommend this product to anyone this is an extremely fun game that will have you at the edge of your seat. Also some advice if you want to get moderately good at the game use an Xbox or PS4 controller. Mouse and keyboard are not as good for higher level skills like aerials.
1;"""Though the concept of RC cars playing soccer seems deceptively simple (and honestly it is) the execution thereof scores such a goal (to stick with the soccer reference) that if you like the concept of """"fun"""" in a competitive setting Rocket League is the game for you. 10/10."""
1;"""Outstanding value for money with this game with many hours people can easilly put into it with a whole """"Easy to learn hard to master"""" kind of mentality for some aspects of the game and would wholeheartedly reccomend it to anyone Even if they are not into sports."""
1;The Best Game I've bought in a long dang time! This game is something you can pick up and play within minutes but im sure will take a long time to master. There are tons of players online Ranked Matches 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 matches. This is just all around fun and a must have.10/10...Awesome Job.....Ohhhh and the unlocks did I say unlocks!!!!!!
1;If you like any game with a football (soccer) element to it you will probably like this game. Cross platform play between PC and PS4 gives this game a nice solid playerbase to work with and when the servers aren't choking on the 100k+ people playing you're in for a good time.If you're not a fan of multiplayer games but still want to check this out the AI is very good in the pro/all star difficulty levels.
1;This game is really amazing and I love playing it with or without friends it doesn't matter. Once you learned the basics of driblling and aerialing you can do so much cool stuff. This game is definitly one you should have it is way better then a lot of other games which cost way more
1;Fun game gets really fun when you learn to play postions. Multiplayer isnt TOO buggy. a few ping spikes now and then. Just get a group of friends or a friend and play multiplayer. or 1v1 duels. overall a good game. perfect for parties b/c of the splitscreen. I would like to see this game open up to the workshop so that users can create mods and whatnot. my rating is a 8.3/10
1;This is a great action packed skill oriented and all around fun game. The graphics are beautiful and the mechanics couldn't get better. If you have what it takes to go into one of the many Rocket League maps and smash cars while making awesome goals then this is the game for you.
1;I wouldn't recommend Rocket League for those without access to an Xbox 360 controller but they are cheap and well worth it and are useful for other games too.That being said Rocket League is really fun with a great community. You don't have to be good to enjoy it. I'm decent and I get a lot of satisifaction when I hit the ball. It's so satisifying. Please get Rocket League!!!
1;This game holds many hour of entertainment and frustration for those who enjoy competitive gameplay. Working my way up the ranks in ranked matches was something to look forward to when I first got this game. It's disheartening to see people who are insanely good at this game but none the less this game is fantastic.
1;What you learn in this game bots on your team are worthlessshots always go over goalenemy bots are pro compared to your teammatesbots on your team are still worthlessghraphics arent near as good as trailerBut if you don't mind any of that crap then this game is great! Already one of my favorites since I don't have to pay for season pass to get online and overall is a great well thoughtout game.
1;This game has brought me hundreds of hours of entertainment at this point. Easy to learn but hard to master psyonix has made an amazingly simple and fun sports game with an extremely high skill ceiling if you're willing to put the time into it. Easily my favorite game currently
1;Love this game support on my laptop and desktop are both awesome and both scale wonderfully to all displayss I have available. Super fun and one of the few games I enjoy to play online with friends or even solo. Definately recommend to anyone even if someone isn't on PC I still recommend it to them for whatever console they have.
1;It's a game that is a cross over between Soccer and cars and it is GOOD.+Athstetically beutiful+Custimization of cars+Driving is GREAT+CO OP mode The two cameras aren't that great but both have there advantages/disadvantages AI in singleplayer is STUPID 8/10
1;Great game and extremely fun! At the same time it can be very competitive which will make you want to get better and better and try to reach the heights that God Kronovi achieved!Dont hesitate buy the game! Best game of 2015 )Are you still reading??Dude...What are you doing??JUST DO IT!!!! BUY THIS GAME!!!
1;Rocket League is a great game to play with a group of friends. The competitive atmosphere of this game is outstanding! My friend recommended that I get this game and it was one of the best decisions I ever made! The game overall is simple but very fun. 10/10 This is a game you should have.Edit after 400+ hours It's still my favorite game on steam 12/10
1;What started as just a new game to try with a group of casual gamers became an addictive challenge with the competitive mode. It's fun quick to learn the mechanics but slow to build on your advanced skills. Being able to gradually improve and still not be at the top is what keeps me playing.
1;Boosting around doing flips in the air smashing into other players and shooting for glory. There isn't much to dislike in this game! Overall this is a very well developed game. The controls are smooth the garphics are the matchmaking is precise. Can easily reccomend for hours of fun! 8/10.
1;I bought rocket league thinking i would play it for a day and get bored....I played it for hundreds of hours in just weeks of having it.if you are looking for a game that will make you question why you are bad at driving a car in a video game. Buy rocket league
1;pros great gameplay really hard to master great grapics fun to play with friends in 200 hours gameplay only 3 people ed my momcons the community like any other multiplayer game is toxic af. if you score they say that you're lucky when they score they call you a noob. when you're playing in teams expect to get yelled at every now and then that's why i recommend ONLY BUY THIS GAME WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS THAT ALSO HAVE THE GAME
1;Product received for free. This is the game you buy play for a few hours and then leave alone in your library for a few months then come back to again and realize it's pretty fun once you start trying to really get into it.And it's pretty cheap too. The economy isn't hard to get into either I spent one key and turned it into roughly 80. That's just my luck though.
1;Fun game!Would reccomend to a friend.Rocket league is a cool game to play with friends if you wanna play seriously or just around! I play both with my friends and rocket league has given us so many memories funny moments (raging moments) and also so a cool game to play just to chill and have fun.
1;One of my favourite games because it is all skill. Players who are mechanically better will win. There is no annoying RNG and also watching online it is easy to understand and follow unlike Overwatch/Dota 2 (both of which I have played). The simplicity of hitting a ball into a goal with a car is just the surface of what is possible.
1;Here's a game that's possible to play for 10 minutes at a time but also will keep you entertain all day if you let it. Easy and forgiving to learn difficult but rewarding to master and never quite letting you feel like you're done. New content is added often. This is the most played game in my library for a good reason.
1;Update is very cool but has alot of bugs such as boost is unheard when boost controlling (rapidly tapped) game crashes unable to join ranked games back if game crashes i cannot see the ranked trails from s4And much more. I hope psyonix fixes all theses problems.
1;The most addicting game i have played in a long time. Even tho i suck at it i enjoy this a lot with my friends.Sometimes the servers screw you over or people with high ping but overall that does not ruin the immersion.I cannot wait to see what Psyonix has to offer us more in the future!!
1;Probably the first e sport I have ever truly come across. The game mechanics are simple at first driving and hitting a ball but the more you play the more you can do. To me the best way to explain this game is like football except you are the footballer's foot and nothing else. With wheels. A footballers foot with wheels.
1;Rocket League is probably the perfect game. Everyone needs to play this.Your mom needs to play thisYour dad needs to play thisYour sister needs to give me her phone number and then play thisSeriously just f*cking get this game it's the best why are you still reading just do it
1;The game starts off with you as a car but then there is this ball that not only are you trying to hit there is a goal you are trying to get the ball into score points but there is other cars that are trying to do the same thing you are some are your friends and some are your enemys. And hats dont forget about hats!
1;Very easy to learn hard to master. Another one of these games that you're the one getting better not the car you're driving in this instance. First time I played my thumbs were extremly swore the next day. Bought almost every single dlc after that. Hard to beat easy to recommend.9.5/10
1;This game is really fun it has amazing dev suport that communicates with it's comminuty as well. It is really easy to jump into and learn but has an incredible skill ceiling. Rocket League also sets the bar for online partying and matchmaking systems.
1;"""I can say this is a really good game It is highly adictive the sense of competition and excitement are allways present it can sometimes be frustating when you re playing with strangers on a team and they play like crap but overall it s a very solid """"sporting"""" experience.After scoring a great goal the sense of empowerment and skill is awesome due to the complexmaneuvers you can pull on your car it is easy to pick up and play but it requires real practiceto master and compete.Very good game."""
1;"""Every match is just five minutes of intense fun. This game is the definition of """"easy to play tough to master"""". You can play it casually but if you are interested you will find out that there are many layers of complexity in the gameplay. You will need to practice to get better but you really dont have to there is big satisfaction with every little action you know you did right in a casual or ranked game."""
1;First couple of hours Think chasing the ball is fun and FLIPPING.Days later playing with friend who has played much longer How the heck are you flying AND hitting the ball.Months later watching replays of first games How the heck are you NOT flying and hitting the ball.10/10 still cringe at those replays.
1;This game is absolutely fun to play especially with friends. Would recommend and would almost say it is an essential to have if you are gaming with friends. It's fairly inexpensive which is good. Just a tip Controller is better than keyboard. Even though I use the keyboard.
1;I love this game! You can have so much fun just by playing football in flying cars! However I do have 1 big complaint that I would like if you could fix in the next uopdate. The AI. I played 1 season game with the AI diffucllty set to pro and the AI demolished me 4 times! Could you please make them less agressive. Thank you.
1;You like RC cars?You like rockets?You like to outmaneuver your opponents to score incredible trick shots?OK then buy this. It has rocket powered RC cars that play football. The european football not the not foot to ball american football.And while I'm a huge fan of mouse &amp keyboard this made me consider buying a controller.
1;You'll think there's nothing easier than moving around a large ball with a rocket powered car. You'll be wrong. You'll think you'll have reached your top skill once you've mastered the flips. Then you'll discover you can fly.You'll spend hundreds of hours trying to become just a little better to find out there are people than can do stuff you didn't even think was possible.And you'll have fun all the way. )
1;Rocket League is one of the weirdest although one of the most involving games i have ever played.At the beginning it looks like bunch of 5 year olds playing soccer (and it plays as such) but the game gets more complex the more experience you get (e.g. aerial play).It contains some singleplayer season mode but the real deal is multiplayer and because of whichi can recommend this game only if you enjoy playing with other people.
1;This game has many personal achievements for me it has my most number of hours played probably the game that I will continue to play for longest period of time and the only game that I enjoy playing online against others.I can't even explain why.But given it's ease of accessibility (you've always got time for a 5 minute game) it just gets played day after days.
1;One of the best games I've ever played. Wasn't too hard to learn yet I'm still learning new things and improving my game is good to play for 5 minutes or 5 hours no pay to win devs totally listen and adjust to their userbase not too expensive cross platform play...I could go on. Every once in a while I buy a new car they've released or a crate key just to support the devs and for flashy new cosmetics. Couldn't recommend more.
1;My favourite game... easy to pick up difficult to master and because each match is only 5 minutes easy to fit into your schedule until you realise you've been 'just one more game' ing for three hours!Note I mainly play this on the Xbox but bought on Steam so I can play on the move too!
1;Well am not the biggest fan of fotboll and i don't really like car games but rocket league... it made my life completei recommend to buy this game for having fun with friends or solo both works! well somtimes.. you can get a bit ragey but that does't mattar cause u can do huge turn backs/comebacks on this game so don't give upp if the oppent did two goals in the start!9.8/10
1;Rocket League is such a fun game for me when im bored or not. They put both of my favorite types of activites in one game soccer and cars! Overall i've had no problems or complants of the game or anything. The only thing is that the lag I get i unreal which isn't your guys fault. Thank you for making this game! Its amazing!
1;Its seems difficult at first but when you start to get the hang of it it becomes very addictive. Super fun to play with your friends.If you like challenging and competitive games this one is definitely for you as the skill ceiling is literaly unlimited and you can become insanely good at it.
1;One of the best games i played!!Pro Unbelievable fun with friends. Recommendable! The provided mutator mode is just awesome. Very competitive Pumped with emotions. You're getting really creative when it comes down to swearing!Cons Rarely lags but when it does then mostly short before you're about to score xD Unfortunately a lot of players leave as soon as they're about to loose.
1;What a fricking amazing game. I had completely ignored it when it came out as I thought it'd be lame to play football with cars. I don't even like football. And instead I am completely in awe by the responsiveness of the controls and aerial play and calculating trajectories. It's a pure pure blast. Buy it. Also if you want to understand how to actually play the game check out some of the pros on twitch.tv ... just saying.
1;"""I really loved this game. It's incredibly fun and even better to play with friends but requires teamwork and skill development to really get """"good"""" at the game. Although matchmaking can be bad at times the Items that you can get and just gameplay in general aswell as the maps are amazingly entertaining.9.75/10"""
1;When I bought Rocket League I didn't have any idea how much I would become addicted and in love with this game I saw one video of the game and found it such an intresting new way to enjoy football and cars at the same time. I just knew I had to buy it and try it out and I must say it is one of the best games I have ever played.
1;"""This game is very very hard at the bigging if you play on a keybored and to set up a controller is so easy with this game theirs no problems. The game is very hard to stop playing unless you get a bad couple of games then you might quite the game as i have done many times. The game is over all fun and i think its a good use of money in a game. AND that is why i nominated this game for the """"JUST 5 MORE MINUTES"""" Award as this be suits the game."""
1;This is another game that you need to take the time to really figure out how good this game is. The first 20 hours I thought it was soccor with cars then I watched someone score an areal goal and I found that there is another demension of this game that I had not realized. There is the ground game and the air game and you need to be good at both.
1;Best original indie title ever! This matchmaking system is the best. I love there is a casual that people actually try in and a comp that people don't troll in. This game is fun and hard to master and I love it the only thing is I can only play about 10 games then I get bored but absolute blast.ProsFun GrindyGood online communityNice pro sceneCons10 game cap9.2/10
1;Gosh this is a great game!I'm that guy that hops around from game to game often leaving some for good but somehow someway Rocket League has kept my attention. The game is easy to learn but hard hard to master. There's so much skill involved and none of that Pay to Win crap. The more skilled you are the better you will play and the more you will win. That's all to it. Graphics are awesome shame that I can't enjoy that (my computer is a potato). Hope you enjoy it! JARVIS
1;This game is easily one of my favorites! The game devs care about their game and are always releasing content. The graphics are good and aren't really that hard on the pc. The most fun you will have is when you play with friends online. It's really satisfying when you do great plays with your team mates. This game is worth the money and is a must have!
1;Super fun. It's a simple fast paced game that is easy to get addicted to. The gameplay is smooth the cars and maps are cool and overall it's just a fun experience. Good online play everything is evenly matched and there is no pay to win BS. Sort of has the feel of older N64 type games in a good way.
1;Besides the selling price continuous and varied entertainment is much older and repetitive fun ensured with friends in the team. Keep it up you are demonstrating how to turn on a game but that you do not abandon the user who has already bought the game but rather you continue to work for him by creating an increasingly large community.
1;Fantastic change of pace from strategy and shooters. Play hockey offline for a nice casual game or fly around in ranked for a crazy intense 5 minutes.The match making is easily the best in any game at every level you'll play people who are a challenge but against who you can definitely win.
1;Rocket league is like rockets on steroids. No football rockets on steroids but in the form of an RC car with jet turbines and really shoddy suspension.This game is absolutely fantastic great by yourself even better with a couple mates. Enough customisation to keep you going forever. Would absolutely recommend it.9/10
1;Really fun game. My only issue is that servers seemed to get worse over time for me. I used to jump on any server and I'd have a good time. Now it takes forever to find a match and it'll lag alot. My PC is not the issue here. Nor is my fast 100mbps connection. Make sure you filter to only your region or u may face the same problems as me
1;Truly the king of flying car soccer games.Kind of like playing a real sport no memorizing engine quirks or keeping up with the latest meta or anything just you the controller and the ability to read the ball and opposition to put the ball into the net. Review brought to you by the Steam Awards 2016/Steam Autumn Sale.
1;Rocket league is an incredible game to both play by yourself or with a group of friends. As it developed they added countless new aspects to improve the game (not that it needed it). Although the game can get boring to play by yourself for long periods of time you could always grab a friend and play for hours at a time XD
1;Addictive. Rocket League is hard to explain really. Going in it seemed dumb to me but popular. I got sucked in. They keep adding more game modes over time which is cool. I'm at 635hours and I don't think I'll stop playing anytime soon. I don't even think I'm really all that good. Fun adddictive game.
1;Probably my favorite Steam game so far.Recommending this to all audiences fun asf with friends insane graphics fast paced takes a bit time to get used to everything but ends up being very satisfactory. Playable for hours upon hours multiple servers for all people around the world community might be a bit toxic but a portion of it is still decent..Many cars to choose from and hundreds of items to decorate yourself with.Highly recommended.
1;One of the most enjoyable games to play. It takes some time to get the hang of it especially when it comes to aerials but this has been one of my go to games for awhile now. Psyonix has done a great job with their continued work on this game and it should be taken as a perfect example of what a developer should do. I look forward to see what else they add and I know that I'll keep coming back to this game for awhile.
1;It's a MUST! Suggest to buy without expansion.Best arcade sports game ever. Fun to play with friends the community is generally polite and it's a challeging game. All cars react the same only visual changes. So you don't need to buy any expansion because standard game allows you to play on every maps. Low cost game but fun as f#$%!See you on field!
1;This game has a huge skill curve At least for me. I've played I've think over 250 hours and i still suck. But it's really worth the money The DLC is always optional and doesn't inhibit you from enjoying the game in any way. Cosmetic items are given after playtime and there is by my knowledge no market for items other than micro transactions and a thriving trading community.
1;Amazing game. There is great competitive gameplay when you want it and ridiculous fun new game modes that come out every few months for free. Even after a year while most of the novelty has worn off I still want to play competitive Rocket League every day. It's a sports game like no other with a very high skill cap as well. Highly recommended!
1;I used to play Rocket League all the time on PS4 and thought I would switch to PC. The change seemed drastic everything was smoother faster and just overall better! I recommend this game but the skill gap is large. If you are a dedicated player and ready to learn get this game.
1;Don't have much to say about Rocket League other than that it is very good I have played a lot of it and I'm continually impressed by all the post launch support the devs have given and continue to give this game. Also most of the players I've played with and against in matchmaking have been suprisingly nice and non toxic folks which is rare to see in a competitive online game.
1;I have played rocket league on xbox for more than 9 months now and it is by far the most fun i have ever had playing a game. I reccomend this game to anyone who doesn't mind being bad and actually wants to strive to get better at something and try something new great game 5/5 play everyday.
1;I have played this game for a year and learned a lot of mechanics behind it. at the beginning as it is with most games it is a challenge to learn the controls and get better. There are scammers and toxic players so be warned but it is an overall fun game. You coyuld get a freind and grind in competetive online games or play with a reandom person or if you desire play online casual games with no concequences and just have fun. 5 star game 10/10 and they update it a lot so that adds to the hype.
1;Very good game! (Must have for local partys ) )I can highly recommend it to anyone searching for an local party game or just for some chilling rounds with your buddies.Besides of that there is also the ability to play competitive games to archieve ranks which can get intense sometimes Really funny and perfect for games with friends but also alone!Already played some houres and there will be more!
1;I totally recommend this game if you like cars and football. It is a lot easier to play with a controller and you would hit some shots that you couldn't hit with a keyboard. The controls are responsive but sometimes you will get matched up with a veteran whrn you are a rookie. Overall a great game for the price.
1;Fantastic game a must have for every collection (especially at the price point).Played many hours on this (second to DOTA) than any other AAA title on the market.DLC exists but it is cheap and not game breaking.Had very few client server glitches due to the poor excuse for broadband in Australia.AND LINUX SUPPORT NOW!! D DI rate it Glorious/10
1;very competitive super addicting never ending and ever improving! the devs are getting a bit money hungry with crate systems but it doesn't affect gameplay at all.. if you like football and/or cars (or even if you don't) this might be the game to try out for it's unique gameplay.
1;This game is a rather good game for the price.It takes time to get good at the game and alot of people will put you off because of the toxicity.But if you look through that there is actually a good community and a fun indie casual game.This game should be taken casually and not serious like these twitch/Elitest guys potray.Play with friends/randoms and have fun!
1;I love this game so much becuase it's such a chill game but it has a really strong competitive side to it! There are lots of tournaments for this game with lots of varying prize pools. The community is also for the most part friendly. I have personaly made a fair amount of friends playing rocket league.
1;Updating too often. I hate that whan I want to spend a few free minutes on Rocket League I have to wait for 30 mins to 1 houre (depends on internet connection and size of the update) before the game will be launched. I really appriciate the quality of the game but please keep calm and let me play
1;This is a great game to play with friends runs well for the most part. However I've run into some connection issues it seems the netcode isn't as stable as it could be and I'd recommed closing all other programs that could be transmitting Internet data while playing this game. Something to note as well is that there is no LAN support despite the game supporting split screen multiplayer.
1;"""I love this game! It's one of my favorite games ever. The mechanics of the game are amazing and new content is constantly being added. The waiting time when you are trying to get into a game is super short at lower ranks however you can wait 5 10 minutes once you hit the higher ranks.The only downside is that there are a lot of s who like spamming the word """"noob"""" for even the slightest mistakes. But if you can ignore those 12 year olds you're gonna have a great time D"""
1;This game is fun if i had to rate it would come in at 10/10. This game can get boring but it is still a over all a really great game. there is Rank system when you win you will move up in points and if you lose you will go down in ranks and it is a x box controller compatable game.
1;This is the best game for those that are bad at racing games. You get to drive some sweet custom cars with rocket boost speeds and play soccer (and now hockey)!! The arenas are great the music is great!Only thing I wish they change is to have the music available in game and not just in the menus.10/10 would recommend!
1;This game is so insanely addictive and I'm not even any good at it. It's a great time killer game don't have to get really invested brilliant for a little bit of late night fun or just wasting some time between odd jobs. Blow off steam or get incredibly frustrated at the guy who keeps hitting into his own goal (normally me). LOVE IT.
1;I do enjoy this game. As a decent player it can be fun and challenging howevert the competetive matching algorithim is garbage. You will end up playing one person who you may beat easily and then lose to someone who could easily be several ranks higher. This makes it extrodinarily difficult to rank up. Though overall do recomend.
1;This game is super addictive you say Okay. One. More. Game. about 10x and then its 3am and you end up sleeping in losing your job and getting pretty decent... only to be crushed by someone better than you. Every. Time. bout 600 hours in after 6 months... many more to come
1;i have seem some youtubers play it and went hmmm that seems went ahead and bought it during winter slae and a got a really fun ga me for a very good price. though i wish i wouldn't always join a game that is always in progress but other then that i ahve no other compalins. overall great game 10/10
1;You will be addicted.I was mostly an FPS player and after trying this game I got hooked. It is very competitive and requires a high level of skilled play including strategic reflexive and practised play. It is also very fun to play with a group of friends.I don't even like soccer but have racked up plenty of hours playing this.Great dev team as well with a good sense of their player base.A+
1;Wait til it goes on sale and buy it. Play bots for a while until you feel like a god. Then watch any tutorial you can get your hands on and go start playing casual games. It'll change your god damn life. OMG WHAT/10 Would wake my wife up at 2am again.
1;Pure fun. It doesn't matter how good or bad you are. You will have fun playing this game because if you suck you will be match with others that suck and you will still laugh your a** off trying your best to push a soccer ball into a goal with a racing car. Eventually you wll get better at it and then it will become very satisfying. Awesome game.
1;This is the most fun I've had in a long time with a game. This game is easy to learn but hard to master. You can play competitive and put your skills up against others while learning new skills in the process. Would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes soccer and is competitive.
1;Probably one of the best multiplayer games I've played. Hours of fun and I'm nowhere near close to unlocking everything. They're times when I have become fed up with the game however the game is updated regularly adding unique game modes and new ways of unlocking extra content. The game also becomes refreshing when you meet other users and participate in tournaments. Highly recommend buying this game!
1;I will admit that this is one of my favorite games. However the recent update upsets me that all cosmetics basically cost a dollar... but they aren't even garunteed that are random. AND there is NO way to get them through only in game material. Thats a huge letdown. I'd rather buy a cosmetic pack for 2 bucks like it has been for so long.
1;Rocket League is by far my favourite game of all time this is a game that everyone must play.I can guarentee anyone who plays this game will enjoy it(seriously it's soccer basketball or ice hockey with Cars!)This game is also cross platform multiplayer game(so you can play on Steam Xbox One or PS4 with anyone playing on those 3 consoles)I Highly recommend this game to anyone.P.S. This game has just been released on Mac and SteamOS(Linux) so anyone can play.
1;It Reminds me of the golden days of gaming.It's only $20 and I've gotten more hours out of it than I've gotten out of most full priced AAA games.The only reason to avoid getting Rocket League is if you have been cautioned by a medical professional to avoid fun activities.
1;Have played the game for about a year now. When i first started the community was great and pretty polite. Now the community is pretty toxic (in game and trades). Still play the game because its fun. Before you buy If you dont want to deal with toxic players would not recommend. If you have played before and have fun then go for it.
1;I genuinely love this game i put so much effort into it.Honest review i would give it 9/10 just purely because of the epic skill required to play thisI personally use keyboard to play this but most people play with controllers as they just prefer the driving controls(Yes handling is better but it just sucks ok)
1;Rocket League is one of the greatest games of the century and is one of those games that you just have to play.It has some stratagy in it but moastly is about having fun with your mates and making epic looking cars.After you play it once you will probebly get it because it is awsome and in my oppinion one of the best gameson steam.
1;This game tilts the heck out of me because I suck but it's fun as hell when you win. The physics get wonky as hell sometimes when two people clash for the ball often leading to some absolute horse goals but other than that this game is polished and fun.8/10 would tilt again.
1;A soccer fan and gamer's Dream!It is worth every penny! It is especially fun whe nyou get your friends to comeover with their PCs to LAN with you. Hella good! Should buy 9/10 will play again....and again... and again....and.............again...........
1;Stop Reading dis ur watsing ur time just buy da game! why u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still readingwhy u still reading!
1;One of the funniest game to play with your friends. Or strangers. Or the computer. The 10/10.Pro endless fun regular updates lots of customisation competitionsCon Sometimes you feel the hitbox is weird. But that is not a big dealValue You can easily buy this game regardless if it is on sale. But of course the best option is to grab the golden/extra/deluxe/special edition with most DLC s when it is on sale.
1;This game is one of the best games I have ever played. Every single game is refreshing and playing car football just doesn't bore me at all. The developers are doing a great job at keeping the game up to date with fun additions almost every month and they listen to the community which is totally amazing. Its a game which is very hard to master and I just love learning every single new trick. &lt 3
1;Cool game with so many aspects to it. I reccommend this to anyone that likes fast paced action packed games. When I first played this I was at it. Now I am getting better and will be practicing as time go's on. Definitely a fun game that will keep you begging for more.
1;Best Mutiplayer Game i have ever played. Maybe it's partly because it maxxes out pretty easily to 1440p/144hz. Probably more so than any other game for how good it looks. But the game is mad fun next big eSport. I don't mind buying keys to support such good devs.
1;Rocket League provides a great degree of freedom in playstyle Matches only last 6 or 7 minutes there are tons of players at all skill levels cars can be customized extensively and there are several gamemodes to choose from.It is a great game whether you wish to play only casually devote your soul to it or something in between. Addicting frustrating but fun nevertheless.9/10
1;Literally the most fun having in 5 minute spans that it will give you an erection or make you throw a controller. You should buy this game. If you can't afford this game call your mother and get her to purchase it for you. If she can't afford it or she's dead get a friend to buy it for you. If all your friends are dead then go blow some dude for $20 so you can get more friends here on RL.
1;If u run a computer that the only decent thing it has is the proccessor dont buy this game. I put thumbs down on Aquedome or whatever it is called and the game got me like 4 games in a row on this map. The problem is that when I play on this map i have like 3 fps the whole game and it is a pain in the But overall good game.
1;Was talked into buying this after much hemming and hawing. Not normally a sports game fan or a racing game fan so I didn't expect this to entertain me much. I could not have been more wrong. Incredibly fun easy to jump into but tough to master conventiently short play sessions but hard to put down. Highly recommended for just about anybody. Gamepad highly recommended though I do have friends who excel with a mouse and keyboard.
1;Absolute amazing game. While I'm doing this to just complete something for badges I chose to review this game for a reason. It is very fun. Even if you're not into sports games you'll love it. There's something special about rocket league. It's an easy game to jump into but a very difficult game to master. And due to the short five minute games (not counting OT) it's a game that you'll have played for hours thinking that you've only been playing for thirty minutes. Highly reccomend.
1;This new update makes my game lag like crazy I keep double jumping instead of flipping because the frame rate randomly drops. I notice this happens to my opponents as well as we will both wiff at the same time. I love the tournaments mode but I can't play this game competitively if it keeps lagging.
1;"""Worst possible way to include tournaments... People can create their own tournaments yeah right thats cool but implementing mutators into it is just waste of an amazing gamemode... It should have same matchmaking as normal 3v3s or ranked 3v3s not this """"server list"""" thing..."""
1;You wanna destroy scrubs? Here you go. You can slam into the enemy to make them explode. You want to be the goalkeeper? Not needed just score and you will make it unable for them to win D.Overal great game to play with friends!10/8 would make own goals again to off friends
1;This game is one of my most favorite games I have played in awhile and has got me hooked for sometime now. If you like soccer and rocket cars this game is for you. It is also playable across consle platforms and computer platforms so if your friend has an X Box he can play with you on pc just not trading. I would suggest getting this game!
1;I would definitly recommend this game! I find it really fun at times but sometimes its immpossible for the car to run smoothly so it lags and I cant really play much and it also sometimes wont let me join a game. Overall I think it is worth the $20 for this game
1;So yeah this game is great its a good time waster as you can play this between playing other games if you're bored and its super fun. But man lately this game has been unplayable for me with the constant lag even when my ping is low and my car having a fit because of it every 5 seconds just makes it not worth playing at times.Great game but needs some serious server work.
1;PROS + Football with cars.+ Highly customisable vehicles.+ Highly competitive multiplayer experience.+ Overall Very Fun+ Lots of updates that add new maps and stuff.CONS May make you very salty. You may encounter very salty people. Lots of 'Extra' things for you to buy (DLCs Crate Keys)Overall I'd give it a solid 8.7/10
1;this game is great if you like soccer. it is fun and you can explode people if going fast enough. it's a fun compettitive sport that was recreated into a virtual version in video game mode with cars. ) ) i recomend this game like 9 999 999 999 999 times.
1;The best sports game I have EVER played. Easily. If your a competitive person that enjoys a challenge I strongly recommend you give this a shot. This controls are extremely responsive and the realism of the physics in this game are incredible. The game is easy enough to figure out how to play in about 5 minutes but it takes countless hours to master.
1;"""600 hours of delightful suffering in I'm still addicted to this game. The snappy controls enormously high skill ceiling and """"drop in drop out"""" style of instant matches in casual or super competitive ranked play all combine to make a nearly flawless product. Play this game with friends for the best experience (and possible loss of friendship...)."""
1;I guess I'll give this wonderful game a thumbs up otherwise I should probably consult a psychiatrist for masochistic tendencies...On a more serious note Amazing gameplay Addictive Nice graphics and sound Lots of game modes A nice little competitive scene Good ranking and matchmaking Big community Simple mechanics yet basically an infinite skill ceiling
1;I love that car My number one star At the Silver Hatch In his little white cap Come one Roary One more lap!Roary the racing car Roary the number one star He's coming to the line Looking real fine Watch out Roary They're right behind you Come on!Roary the racing car Roary My number one starRoary the racing car!
1;Really Good game when i first see it i was afraid of purchasing it but then i decided to and im glad i did no regrets excelent multiplayer and season mode best mix between football and cars EVAH multiple game modes and also ranked match making try it out you will enjoy it for sure!
1;Soccer with Cars! Comes packaged with Multiplayer Single player season mode A crapload of vehicles and visual upgrades to choose from and last but not least nailbitingly fun gameplay. Very addictive. Can be played crossplatform with console players as well. Recommended for sure.
1;This game is great for a quick burst of fun. If you are doing bad you can keep playing or if you are doing good you can keep playing. Very addictive and fun. I dont mind the toxicity of the community its like that on every game any more. I just mute them and move on. I would love to be able to shoot the other cars in a different game mode.
1;Oh man is this game worth it you WILL get your $20 out of it unless you're totally not into the gameplay.Everything you think would be easy turns out to be incredibly challaging and the amount of depth in simple ball hits is incredible if you like football this is probably the best adaption you can get.Also it's crossplatform with Playstation so you can beat those console peasants.
1;Pros Is very entertaining especially for casual gamers. More bang for buck. Customizable cars lets you have some freedom with your style. Gamemodes are all creative though you will like some more than others. Competetive for those who want to take their skills to the next level. Very fun and fast gameplay.Cons Easy to pick up hard to master. The hazing process in this game feels neverending.9/10
1;This game will bring out the inner child who likes to kick a ball around this time you can do it with cars that can jump and fully ram into other players while trying to get a winning goal in the last 3 seconds. Game play is smooth match making quick lots of fancey skins and do dads all of which are only cosmetic. Totally recommend folks to pick this up if you want quick games of silliness.
1;"""Simply put one of the best games I've ever played. After a little over a year of playing it it's in my top ten games of all time. Perfect example of """"easy to play hard to master"""" type gameplay. Arcadey feel yet there's tons to learn. Great game to look at performace is solid as well. I can't see myself stopping anytime soon."""
1;Hella fun with or without friends.You'll meet some of the friendliest persons here or sometimes the short tempered.But I had fun anyways. It's god damn rockets on cars hitting soccerballs 10 15x the normal size and exploding enemies that are in the way Who doesn't love that combination?
1;I can honestly say this is one of the most influential games I have ever played. countless hours with friends family and strangers going at it and enjoying every game. Even when you suck you still have fun. Absolute buy for anyone looking to take a break from life or another game.
1;"""This is one of those games that you'll be terrible at. Even when you start to think """"Hey I'm pretty good at this finally"""". In reality you're still bad. It's okay though you just had the ball bounce off you and it accidentally went into the goal. Just go with it. Act like that was on purpose. It's what everyone does. You're a pro now (you're not)."""
1;This is one of the few games that I have actually gotten really into maybe even addicted. I've been playing this game for about a year now (began on PS4). I would definitely recommend this game as it is very unique and have never imagined I would play a game like this. Definitely give it a try. It may be fustrating at first but as soon as you begin getting the hang of it you will improve very quickly.
1;Before buying someone may think (i did too) that this game could become stereotypycal after few hours..no. This is my favourite multiplayer game! You still have and want to improve and there are so much ways to play.Also it has great community and developers. They care about players and thats thing that is really important in gaming world.. WHY DID U REMOVED NEO TOKIO (
1;"""Best """"sports"""" game I ever played.Quite easy to learn impossible to master extremely fun at all levels of play.Inexpensive lots of free content no Pay to Win yet some good aesthetics microtransactions. This is honestly the game of the last 2 years for me. I spent a bit more money than a """"normal"""" game's price just because I don't mind to and want to encourage Psyonix for being so great.If you're wondering if you should buy it Do it. It's only $20 and it's worth so much more."""
1;Addicting. Not only the actual game the god damn TRADING. I've spent 100's and 100's of hours on over 5 different trading websites getting profit and making profit. I made 20 keys worth of stuff without buying any keys to begin with and there are many others that got over 3000 keys worth of stuff! Definetly recommend high skill ceiling game that you'll never get bored with )
1;Rocket League is probably the best arcade driving game I've played or even seen. The controls aren't clunky the responses are lightning fast and it's just a great game to play.Probably the only game in which I don't even care about losing because even simply drifting around the map is good enough to make my day.Definitely worth it if you see it as a cheap enough price don't hesitate to buy it!
1;Rocket powered cars + soccer? Sounds weird on paper but it's some of the most addictive gameplay I've ever tried. Insanely high skill cap and somehow it feels more like playing a sport than playing Fifa. If you think it seems like a weird idea just give it a try you won't regret it.
1;Pretty good game takes some getting use to. Very aggressive community maybe a bit toxic but if you are coming form CSGO TF2 or LoL you should be use to this. Game plays well and is nice to look at very casual game. Great if you need to kill five ten minutes.
1;It's near impossible to put this game down. A low floor and very VERY high ceiling makes this game super fun and addicting for people of every skill level especially if you have friends to play with. To top it off the developers are one of the best companies in the industry and actually care about making their community happy.This game is a steal at its regular price for the countless amount of enjoyment you get out if it.
1;I absolutely loathe this gameIt's a game whit a simple premise drive around in a car that has a jet engine and the ability to jump. Your purpose is to hit a ball and score a goal. Sounds easy? Think again! The amount of raw skill and practice needed to enjoy this game is beyond my definition of fun. Still the game is simple and well executed so i can only give a good recommendation of it.9/10 Would cry salt again.
1;The best game I have ever played I love it I am in a relationship with Rocket League. This game is seriously fun it never gets old this is my alt account and I have 500 hours on it plus my main account has over 1500 I have been playin git since it came out and I will NEVER be tired of it.
1;The game itself is good.But Psyonix was able to make the game WORSE with each single Patch/Update.Not sure wether there are many more developing teams who are able to make a game worse with each update.More Ghost hits heaps of server crashes bad pings sometimes. Lovely
1;This game brought me back into video games. After a long hiatus I retured to so many options it was mind boggling. Every game seemed so complex and hard to get into high learning curves with little payoff. The simplicity is the greatest thing about this game simply getting to enjoy a game without some drawn out story with lengthy dialogue or games that make it challgening to simply get into.. then you throw in competitive multiplayer and it gets addicting.
1;Hi i cant figure out how to turn universal access on to party people. i know its on and i see that its on but in rocket league it says it isnt. i dont know why but i would like to beable to party my friends and also shift tab doesnt work.my computer in a mac fyi
1;Fantastic! This game is excellent. Player base is improving and the bots are well more lively late night. Controls are great ball physics are crazy. I really do like the new content and looks like they got a HOTWHEELS colloab on the edge of blowing up! ***CONTROLLER a MUST!***
1;I used to hate this game a lot. My original review was negative because of nit picky stuff which amounted to me not being as good as I wanted to be. After climbing higher up on the skill latter and learning how to actually practice things I don't know how to do my opinions changed. Also helps that the game has come a long way since 2015 when I started playing.If you like cars and soccer and teamplay with friends this is a real interesting game to play.
1;YO! This game is really fun. I got hooked after playing it with a friend. I'm really competitive so I got addicted in the drive to get better. While this game may seem simple there are a lot of mechanics that take time to learn simply by repetition. So in a short you get out what you put in. So GRIND GRIND GRIND
1;Way are you not playing Rocket League. Play Rocket League. PLAY IT. Don't like soccer? I don't care play it. Soon neither will you. Don't like cars with rockets in them? What the hell is your problem? Don't like America? Well if Donald Trump wind the election neither will I!
1;This game has a very simple premise to it but there are so many possiblities. You can play casually or unlock competition through competitive there is always something to improve on. Plus the developers really listen to the users and actually implement the features that we really like to see in the game.
1;"""Awesome game. Steep learning curve but once you get the hang of it it's so satisfying to just jump fly through the air like a mad man and shoot the goal straight into the goal.Plenty of cosmetics to choose from so you can pimp out your car to your liking. Want to shoot tacos out of your exhausts? This game got you covered!10/10 would spam """"Nice shot!"""" again. Totally recommend it!PS Even tho the game is """"playable"""" with keyboard you will be a lot better with controller."""
1;It's a great game a lot of fun pretty competitive but match making is You're either a low level and placed with masters or a high level and placed with rookies. If you want an easy to learn but hard to master game this is it. Even better with friends.
1;Rocket League is a Very social game and i think anyone can play it. it just has a lot of trash talk between players but overall this game can be really fun with friends or just by yourself! i would rate this game well but tell me what you think of it because i wanna see your reviews and recommendations! Thanks &lt 39/10
1;Of the games in my steam library I have spent the most time with this game. It has everything from a simple concept that can be scaled in difficulty for ranked play to fun and unqie game modes to play with and against friends. This game is well worth the money!
1;This game is great if you're willing to recognize and accept your flaws as your playing it and are willing to put in the effort to improve your gameplay over a potentially very long time.If you're not comfortable with that then maybe this game isn't for you. It's still hilarious fun with friends but you won't have anything to keep you going if you're playing alone and only ever blaming others. Overall 8/10. I still think a racing mode would be hilarious.
1;Rocket league is THE most chill game in my library. You dont need to focus or go full try hard mode (unless you want to) to just have fun while playing it. When you are new to the game your gonna laugh your of when you play with a friend and have so much fun. I recommend to just disable the audio ingame and play your favorite songs while you play instead just chill and have a great time.
1;Awesome game definatly worth the buy. When I started playing this game I love it and I still do. It's crazy dinamics + it's diverse modes/gameplay make it awesome to play/watch. I especially love aerials its so satisfying when u get an aerial goal! 100% reccommend. 9/10
1;Game is mad fun but the server issues are just so bad. Games been out for more than a year and it still has server issues? Really? Its just so annoying i gotta quit every 5th game coz we have 400ping and its just unplayable. Other than that game is great.
1;I am not a fan of soccer cars competitive games or sports in general. But rocketing around with these cars desperately trying to score has been the only gaming experience in years to make me actually jump up and cheer. Try it if it looks even slightly interesting to you.
1;Recently recieved this game from a friend and Im already in love with it. I've had it for at least a couple days now and I play it everyday no matter what! It gets very addicting after playing this game over and over again. I recommend this game for anyone willing to buy this for a friend or for themselves!
1;This game is mad fun I have played a bunch of this game on here and xbox and absolutely love it to death. If you want fast paced heart racing action then here you go (no it's not like the action you get from shooters but still). This game is just so fun I can't stress that enough 10/10. Get this game and just have fun )
1;Wanted to make an aerial Collected boost for some time OMG It's the time Started flying Hit the ball Ball bounced above the goal Opponet gone for it Missed I accidentaly scored an own goal Teammate yelled at me and left Next one arrived Saw the score and left I spent the rest of the match with a bot Yelled in front of my computer as it wasn't doing anything Lost 2 611/10 Would yell at bots and ragequitters again
1;What a save!Wow! Savage!Whew!Just a few words you'll come across while playing this game. It's really fun quick paced and the learning curve isn't that bad to be honest. If you like football (soccer if you're from the states) and cars you'll be in for a treat with this game! I have owned it for both the PC and Xbox and it's a game that you cannot get bored of.10/10
1;"""Product received for free. What to say...First this is my absolutely favourite game. Not even that expensive compared to the hours you can play it.Second nothing of P2W. If you want to open crates that's ok you can get skins and cars but the real skill comes from the cars (even with the 1st car you get called """"Octane"""" which is the best for all car actually).Just....a nice game to play with friends or alone give it a try.PS """"I recommend using a controller""""."""
1;Difficult Yet fun! I went into this game with high expectations. expecting it to be easy but boy was I suprised! It starts off with a tutorial that explains the controls decently. After a bit of gameplay i learned that i was just scratching the surface of just how much i could do with my car. The ranked match system is great! I have played with people that are very close to my skill level. Overall this game is very good!
1;Steep learning curve and frustrations to be had with Rocket League but that is part of the fun. There is truly no other game like this.Although there are a fair few DLC options to choose from and a loot box system the rewards are all cosmetic.Would recommend to anyone looking for a new experience.
1;This game will ensure all kinds of emotions going to you in one 5 minute game. Anger excitement joy and loads of fun are gauranteed. This game is quite cheap on steam and occupies less space allowing for an easy addition to your collection of games.I'm just hoping that the devs add more antennas' wheels skins and atleast a couple of free cars for casual Rocket League players. Thanks for reading the whole thing !
1;Ah Rocket League literally car soccer. My favorite game that I continue to play to this day. I recommend it to anyone simply because of the fact there is no way of knowing if you like it or not until you play.One of the most entertaining hype filled energetic original games I have ever played. Buy it. 10/10
1;I had troubles finding a game on the pc that I truly enjoyed playing until I found rocket league. Its a very simple concept of a game but it withholds a world of fun. I can play this game all day if I had the time. For 20 dollars too? There would be no reason not to buy this. GET IT NOW
1;You drive a rocket powered remote control car. You use that car to play rocket powered car soccer. Its fun. Its addictive. Its Rocket League.There isn't a whole lot else to say about Rocket League except that its a novel idea actually executed to its fullest potential. In an industry stagnating with sequels and reboots Rocket League is a breathe of fresh air (and yes this is technically the second version of the this game but thats ok). Overall Rating A
1;"""Brilliant game especially if you mute it then listen to music!You NEED a controller if you want to do ariels!It is pretty hard but when you nail a shot the feeling is so awesome!The only bad thing is playing pub the people it matches you with it tends to put better people on the opposite team and then pair you with people who it says are """"Pro"""" or """"Veteran"""" but can't even hit the ball!"""
1;The game is very well done light so the weaker devices run it in lower graphic quality with no problem and the physics are very well done too! I highly recommend the game it's addictive and exercises your brain to test your reflexes and to trick the other players worldwide
1;Rocket League Is Great! Its My Most Played Game Mostly Becasue Of How Much I Play Game And Trade For Things To Make The Game Even Better! I Really Have Only 1 Complaint! TAKE AWAY THE STINKING TRADE WAIT THERE IS LITTERLY NO REASON I CAN THINK OF TO HAVE IT GET RID OF IT I COULD GET SO MUCH IF IT WASNT IN THIS GAME!Other Then That Complaint Great Game 8/10 RexonBloodBlad/Bob_Builder101 Builder Army Youtube
1;Probably one of my favorite games it's a great game. It just has a little bit of a learning curve but after you learn how it all works its really good. It is very exciting and a emotional rollercoaster. It feels so good to win and you scream when you lose.the only problem i have with the game is that it has a few smurfs from time to time which kinda sucks but besides that its a great game.
1;Excellent gameplay. I picked this up mostly to play with my friend... I didn't like it at first but as I started to get better the gameplay really started to pick up. This game is perfect for someone who doesn't have hours in the day to play games since games in Rocket League only take 5 7 minutes (depending on how many goals are scored due to instant replays.) Gameplay is a lot more fun with friends but it can be easy to find other people online to queue up with.
1;"""This game has it all. It's got cars it's got balls it's got rockets.... Why are you still reading this? Go buy the damn game already and install! You will NOT regret Carball. This game will make you laugh cry laugh again spam """"Wow!"""" and cry from laughter."""
1;ARE YOU READY TO GET PUNTED ALL OVER THE FIELD BY YOUR ENEMIES AND FRIENDS ALIKE???!?! BOY DO I HAVE A GAME FOR YOU!!!! seriously thought this game is awesome. However you will get punted away from the ball an annoyingly high amount of times take a deep breath.
1;If you just want to kill some time or get in on some intense competitive action this game fits both needs. It's easy to get into but hard to master. Personally I don't like sports games like fifa or similar but... Give me fast paced action and cars with rockets and I'm sold DAlso the game keeps getting constant support from the Devs and they are always listening to the community.
1;This is a great game. The community is great. There of course is some toxicity but many people are kind. I really feel like I get better with every match that I play and I love that sense of progression. Some times it is rage inducing and seems unfair when you get matched against players way better than you. But most of the time it is just so fun. It feels so natural and the physics are excellent.9.5/10
1;Rocket League is when you mix rc cars with soccer or basket ball or hockey or soccer with a plunger and some of mother nature.Just an all around fun game to play the first time i accomplished an aerial was like figuring out how to ride a bike for the first time. Great game to play with friends especially since the voice chat in game seems to be subpar for a game that relies on communication a lot.
1;For solo play this game is good but when you play with your friends then it gets even way better.Playing together in team or against each other it doesn't matter. With this game you will laugh cry pull out your hair and get confused all in just one sitting. And it happens every single time.GG Psyonix.
1;"""Ridiculously fun and addicting. The skill cap is sky high in this game but I've found it to be fun at all levels of experience. One bonus is that it makes for great spectating in e sports too easily the most spectator friendly game I know of.The """"physics"""" can take a little getting used to (I use quotes because the ball doesn't always behave in a very realistic way e.g. when being hit by two cars at once) but when you do get used to it it feels pretty consistent."""
1;Unlike other esports this game has its roots deep in real sports. It is analogous to real sports in terms of the skill focus. You keep practising and toning your mechanical skills. After you have become a master of the fundamentals of the game you can then try to perform astonishing acrobatic moves and keep pushing the limit on what is possible in this game. At a higher level strategy also becomes more of a factor where the mind is just as important as your mechanical skills.
1;I've spent a lot of time on this game. Majority of it was spent enjoying the mechanics and gameplay of it. Unlike other games it inspires new ways to look at something old. This game makes soccer breathe a fresh breath of life no other game can provide.
1;Been a while since I felt like I was completely incompetent at gaming.I can pick up and play most any game and have a pretty good spatial sense in both virtual and real worlds.It took me five ing minutes to get the ball in the goal on a field by myself the first time I played this.And I loved every minute of that incompetent and childlike wondering.Get this game!
1;"""This is by far my most favorite multiplayer game ever! As someone who like skill based games that requires the player to outplay the opponent this game fits me perfectley! The community in this game on the other hand is high contrast there are mostly a bunch of whiny players who can't take the blame themselves and pours it all on you. But then there's those who doesn't say anything and the ones that take all the blame """"gotta tell'ya"""" RESPECT THEM!!"""
1;What to say about this game? It is absolutely brilliant. Sure there's a learning curve a kind of big learning curve actually. But this is one of my all time favorite games. Bar none. It is brilliant. The devs are amazing it is in no way pay to win it is just brilliant. I honestly can't think of anything else to say. I've put over 300 hours into this game and can't get enough. And on top of ALL THAT it's $20. tl dr If you're even slightly thinking about this game get it. Get it now.
1;"""Rocket League is a game wthat defines """"Simple to learn incredibly difficult to master.""""You start out simply focusing on trying to hit the ball and over time you physically can see yourself improve trying and succeeding at tasks you never even knew were possible in game.If you at all enjoy cars soccer explosions or people off I suggest you buy this game!"""
1;"""I think the fact I have put 420+ hours into a game with no campaign and no real """"end goal"""" speaks greatly about what I think of this game. I am still having fun with this game even after my rage moments when I lose 5 in a row and want to uninstall it. It is just a great fun game. The recent rumble update is a awesome addition even if a little buggy at times but that will be patched I am sure. Highly recommend this game but just be ready for hostle game chat. Have fun )"""
1;explaining this game to people around you is rather easy RC cars that can fly and soccer in a cage. there's rocket league.while it's rather hard when you play your first games you improve to the point it's never your fault that your team lost it's always someone else.
1;HiTo begin with this game was outstanding visually and a great way to make time pass.You don't need to like football/soccer or cars for that matter to play this games as it's soo much fun!Really enjoyed it and will be buying once payday is upon my withering carcass so thou shalt reap the day to come in rocket league.Buy it. No Regrets &lt 3
1;So here's the thing...1.) I'm not a big fan of soccer.2.) I'm not a big fan of car games.3.) This. Game. ROCKS!!!If you're even slightly entertaining the idea of getting it...GET IT. NOW! It is so much fun.The fact that the devs constantly update this game with so many things including free maps makes it even better too!
1;Vroooooommm... Miss the ball Learn to fly... Vroomm... Got speedboost.... Clears the ball... Vrooooommm... Aims for the ball... Got hit by a teammate.... Vroooommmm.... Positions the ball.... Aimed at goal.... Teammate boost at your back taps the ball a little then... Goal!!! WTF you stealing ******* that's my goal. Uhhh. Plays another game. Repeat
1;Okay. Played 100 hours more. Still autism but now after some updates and time it's somewhat bearable. You NEED nice teammates in this game or you will lose your sanity c + Even if you don't like football you'll most likely like Rocket League+ It's fun at times and addictive Community is TRASH Matchmaking faulty most of the time SMURFS
1;Fun and addictive game to play. It's something different. You can casual play with friends and have a fun night or you can practice up and get competitive with it. Some rage come with this game but it all depends on how competitive you really are. I definitely recommend this game!
1;Rocket League... One of the best games at the momment always updating brining new seasons every 4 months and it has some great mechanics. Unfortunately this game also have some bad points including the bad/Salty community (some persons are kind) the lag and it also has some bugs... But it Stills a very good game.8 7/10 in my Opinion.
1;"""When you first start you'll probably miss a lot and people will mock you with their """"What a save!"""" insults but if you keep at it and develop it becomes a lot of fun when you can hit your shots. Great casual game to kill some time or you can hop on ranked and have people fly around scoring all over you."""
1;Rocket League is my favorite game since it released the atmosphere and sounds add a lot. I definitely recommend playing with friends however it is playable alone. The adrenaline you get from a 1 1 match with 20 seconds left is great this game is 100% worth it's price. No pay to win items only cosmetic crates.
1;This is by far by favourite most played game. At first I can see why it can be seen as boring because I was terrible and I dind't play ranked. However once I became good and started playing ranked I loved the game even more. Now I am in champ 1 and even when I'm not playing ranked it's fun to freestyle with my friends. Really good game I suggest it's a must have game on your steam account.
1;This is a fantastic game.+Works on low end PCs (not very demanding)+Captures the competitive feeling of sports+Teamwork pays off+Cross platform+Has many different playing modes I don't have much to put here. Maybe they could try to develop the cross platform a bit further like adding ranked or so.
1;This is probably the best game to come to me other than Forza Horizon 3. I love games with racing or just cars in general and this game takes a whole new way with it. Rocket League is now probably my favorite game &lt 3. But I think they should add 2 cars. 1. Some kind of Bugatti car. 2. I think there should be a Lamborghini Veneno car added into the game that you can get from crates. Otherwise I hope everyone plays this game! Merry Christmas everyone!
1;You wouldn't expect a game with such a simple premise to be so enjoyable. Who would've thought that adding rockets and the ability to do flips and tricks to car soccer would make it so much better.10/10 would get molested (figuratively of course) by people who I swear have trancended this reality and uploaded their conciousness onto Psyonix's servers to become rocket league gods and achieve immortality by becoming one with their cars.
1;A great game where you can solo it if you want or you can try build the best team ever! almost NONE bug of problems..matchmaking is alright doesnt take much getting into a match.they do have DLC's and Boxes yes... but every now and then theyalso give away free content and free keys to boxes at least something balancedRecommended!
1;I hate sports games and car games but rocket league combines the two genres perfectly!! This game is very competative with an awesome game engine! Lots of car customization options as well as game modes. Been meaning to leave a good review on this game for a while now! Constantly evolving with updates. This game has a constant following and i never have issues getting in matches.
1;One of the best car games i played ever.Community is mostly nice and friendly.Gameplay is fun and engaging.Sometimes gameplay can get a bit stale but it doesnt matter since the games are short and its generally common to play it just casualy hop in for a game or two every now and then
1;This game is great cotrols take a bit to get adjusted to especially if you're looking to fly and do all these nifty tricks. Even if you can't fly the game is quite enjoyable. Only thing that is frustrating is the disconnection that happens at times especially when you're about to win that rank up game oh sweet victory how far thou art. Also some players will get you fuming however it's a game they're probably new and don't know better so teach them and don't scream at them.
1;Rocket League is by far one of my favorite games. Once you get the mechanics down you'll be having a blast each match. Collecting different items for your cars and customizing them will be a hard drive towards that next game. Definitely give this a shot and let yourself break through the learning curve. It is well worth it.
1;"""What an AWESOME GAME!Seriously best sport game ever!I've spent more than 400 hours on it (200 here and 200 on my psn account) and this game is perfect! )Rocket League is the perfect example of a game that is """"Easy to learn HARD to master!""""Go get it! NOW!"""
1;It's a football game where you play in cars try selling that to someone who has never played the game before. This game is brilliant and I still can't quite put my finger one why but it works. Even if you don't enjoy football/soccer/sport you can still have a lot of fun with this. I do think it's one of those games that until you've played it you don't know what you were missing though.
1;This is one of the few games I keep coming back to every now and then. I don't know why it does that but sometimes I get such an adrenaline boosts I just can't get stop playing it. The feeling of success when you score or save a goal is really rewarding.And it's not just about football (or soccer). It has modes for ice hockey and basketball as well and in addition some RL specific modes which put your air dribble skills to use.A game that's easy to learn but hard to master.
1;After almost 700h of this game i can say this is really addictive and good game im still not bored ) There is much cars to choose and every single car has diffrent hitbox turning radius. Try this game and you really can't stop playing it D I have played with ps4 controller keyboard and xbox controller and all of those all good but i would recommend to use controller its much easier to control cars ) One im using now is Steam controller which is in my opinion the best way to play this game )
1;Match making is horrible but the rest of the game is well designed but the match makeing need so much fixing it normally ends in you getting crushed or your crushing the other team having a fun and close game is a rarity and for those who say other wise i have over 600 hours across pc and xbox so i know these things. great game if your queing with friend but solo you will be pulling your hair out half the time.
1;Best competitive multiplayer game I've played in a long time. It's relatively easy to pick up but hard to master and is very addicting. Matchmaking is not perfect which can be frustrating at times when you are in the lower levels and are suddenly facing a bunch of veterans but otherwise the game is still good fun and I enjoy playing with my friends. 9/10.
1;Really great game that no matter what else I'm playing I always manage to find ten minutes here or there to throw down. Great playing with randoms online or bots in a league and even better with friends. You will not regret buying this game even at $20
1;The greatest game i own. You do not need my words to determine that watch any youtube video of someone playing this game you can sense how much fun they are having. Look at the hours that people play this game for and they still aren't bored. The skill ceiling is amazingly high and challenges you to reach a higher level of skill.Buy it.
1;This game is fun yet hard to play If you're willing to wait and train your skills 100% GET ITIf not OVER 9000% dont get it...Pros FunChallengingcompetitivegood customizationGood controls Simple gameand you can do random like destroy/trolling peopleCon You will get trolledVery hard 2 do de urrrr airealIt finds crappy servers for you sometimesOverall 8/10 reccomendedBut it would be better if it was avalible 4 mac cus my friend is a retard and doesnt knoe how 2 check
1;The best simulation of football ! Despite the fact that I love FIFA and PES Rocket League yet his head because of time the developers add something new even if there are cars and pay ! The Game is very dynamic sometimes you can't know where the ball can fly and the game is changing in the opposite direction . Has Very few burger ( passable ) have Rating games the so called MM .My rating 10/10 the game is cool and you can play it all day .
1;I have played hundreds of games since I was a kid and this is one of those rare games for me that has turned into an instant classic. This is a game that I will always go back to. It never gets boring imo and the ranking system always keeps you feeling like each ranked game counts for something.
1;Rocket League is a great game. It is well made and regularly updated by its creators.The game is easy enough to pick up play football with cool cars! Difficult to master however with a challenging learning curve build around ranked matches to measure your progress if you like competition. If competitive scene isn't your thing the short 5 minute matches make pick up games fun casual and a great way to game with friends.I would reccomend Rocket League to anyone!
1;Amazing game. soooooo much fun. Basically unlimited customization but ranked system could be slightly better. I don't think that I should go from Div 2 to Div 3 in the rank below me after barely losing a game. Also most people that you will meet will be d**ks but hey that's the internet right?
1;Updates always coming out.. never any problems or bugs... its great for people with a budget because you can play without having to have an insane pc... although it does help... 10/10 if you like this style of game... and &lt 3's to Psyonix and the development team...
1;just get it. 2 tips 1 do all the training modes and alot of levels in exhibition before you go competitive so you can hold your own.2. when you do go online set the options to quickchat only. (preset options for chat) with most popular games there is alot of good people but just as many angry window lickers aswell. so quickchat limits there already limited vocab down to preset phrases saving your eyes the trouble of making sense of the keyboard mashes.
1;I love this game. And I'm happy that my friend's said for me to get this game. I am completely addicted and have the most hours in my group. If you want to get a game that you can spend a few mins on and you can play single player or multiplayer then this is a great game that I would definatly reccomend getting.
1;It's a great game it is exciting and a lovely thing is you grow in the game. This is one of the few games based on skill not on you're items lvls ... I love how psyonix keeps updating the game for free. Roughly i would highly recommend buying this game!I warn you it's addictive...
1;"""This game is very well optimized and very fun. i would recommend to people who have played the old edition SUPERSONIC ACROBATIC ROCKET POWER BATTLE LAMBOS. Jesus And God thats a long name for a good game. EDIT My balls itch so i decided to edit this FIRST of all this game sucks I have played many times and it sucks my harry potter lovin wein. Honestly if you're looking to buy a """"good game"""" then stop by at ROCKET LEAGUE TRADEMARK LOGO and play this cancy game"""
1;"""This is a game that seems stupid at first (I remember thinking """"Why would I get a game with soccer and cars? I don't like either of those things!"""") but once you start playing it's impossible to stop. Addictive and fun! Now if only my PC could run Aquadome..."""
1;A suprisingly high skill cap and tight movement controls make for a much longer lasting enjoyment of the game than I was anticipating. The only downside is the matchmaking. I can play ranked and get matched against people of my skill level but as soon as I step into quickplay I'm getting matched against Rocketeers and Legends who absolutely destroy me.
1;Product received for free. Rocket League is the most original game created in recent years.It's a game played by football with cars which is not original one he made me addicted difficult game although I'm not goodIn short I would recommend this game this game is good and worth $ 60.
1;An addictive high octane twist on soccer. I didn't expect to love the game when I first bought it but have grown to genuinely enjoy my time. Scoring goals with or against your friends has never felt better.Competitive is a bit frustrating I would try and play with your friends and communicate for the best experience. Be careful about talking as well due to autoban chat filter robots and whatnot. Toxicity in this game helps no one.Buy it but don't play it by yourself
1;Very fun! Once you get into higher levels of play you have to learn new skills and techniques in order to compete. My serious knock on this game is what appears to be poor matchmaking. It's supposed to be set up so that you'll win a couple matches after losing some. Though that's clearly not the case when you win 3 matches over the course of a couple of days (which translated to 7 hours of play for me)
1;This game is very good. There are no cheaters and the game isn't pay to win you can buy differents cars just for appearance (and it'll cost a few dollars or less)...I've spent almost 600 hours playing this awesome game and the developers care very much about updates which include new maps new modality etc.Totally recommended.
1;Easy to learn Hard to master. Personal performance game where you have nobody to blame but yourself if you screw up. Gets the adrenaline going like you are watching your favourite sport AND actually taking part in the match. Don't play if you are about to go to sleep. &lt 3 Rocket League 4eVa xxoo
1;Very fun and very addicting. I've got over 700 active hours invested already in two and a half months. Some players are toxic but over all its a great game that leaves you with the feeling that your always improving and that next time you could do better. 8.5/10
1;Love it so much I have bought it on multiple platforms. Never gets old for me. Developers seem to always be working to add and improve content on an already excellent game. It is very much a PLAY to win game (no DLC needed to be good) although the DLC content is very inexpensive and entertaining. Plus you don't mind buying it just because you want to support this awesome developer and game as much as you can. Great stuff!
1;The base game is great value for your money with frequent free updates and all the dlc (only cosmetic) is super cheap. It's got lots of different fun and casual game modes as well as a great competitive system. At first glance it can seem like a simple game but you'll never run out of mechanics to learn and improve on.
1;Great game to play by yourself gets even better with friends growing eSports scene takes a little bit of time to learn before you start really playing soccar (rather than luckily flipping and driving into the ball) but the skill ceiling is high and the path to get there is steep but steady. 10/10 would spend 2x original cost of game on keys again.
1;Easy to play hard to master.Fun creative amazing addictive.Players of all kinds noobs salty tryharders competitive trollers kids afk s.This game released along time ago and will never be forgoten.It is all about precision and reading the ball. It is a must play.The only question is. Do you have the skill to master your fingers around controller?
1;Verry gyyd game!gyd cuz No balance problems High skill floor High skill cap After 1000h still learing new tricks (It's almost like playing guitar)B�d cuz Toxic community as in every game these days (not as bad as LoL and dota) After 1000h you can still find players that slap out of ya
1;"""I love this game. It's an amazing game at all skill levels although people will still get upset with you if you're """"bad"""" and they get matched with you. At higher levels of the game the hitboxes on each car is what makes almost all the difference in the world and there's certain cars that are way better than others there's maybe 5 cars people use in total because they're the best (even though Psyonix claims all cars are the same they're clearly not)."""
1;A game which united Console and PC a game which at its core is one simple thing like CoD Online but still people find new ways to make it interesting with a great dev team that actually care about their game and community unlike some *cough* Rockstar *cough* 15/11 would propel through the air and play football/soccer with cool looking persnalised vehicles.Easy enough to play and very addictive make sure to stock up on sleep because this is going to drain it.
1;well here comes my first review!!! just in case you don't know what I mean just get itEdit You might think it's hard to hit the ball cuz I did. You might think the sick goals pros do are hard to pull off cuz I did. But with more time you can do it cuz I did
1;"""Football (or .. """"Soccer"""" ugh) + Cars Awesome Combination!Pretty basic game concept shoot the ball into the enemies goal and prevent that they do the same to you.It works is easy to learn but hard to master and is overall fun! Fitting background music in the menus and soundeffects ingame. Nothing more I have to say."""
1;I am now 800+ hours in the game and still ranked in challenger 3 D But still I love this game! Just try to not get tilted so badly once you up.. Just laugh about it try to fix your fails and you'll love the game )Psyonix also really is one of the greatest Dev teams out there..PRAISE PSYONIXPRAISE PSYONIXPRAISE PSYONIX
1;Not a fan of sport games?You'll think this game is amazing anyway.Not a fan of car games?You'll still think this game is amazing.Not a fan of both?I'm sure you get the hint.But please use a controller. Game isn't meant to be played with keyboard + mouse.
1;400 hours of gameplay and still as enjoyable as ever the Match making could be improved. you get allot of smurf accounts. besides that it is incedible. never gets boring ( Does get annoying at times ) Graphics are still beautiful and has some interesting car packs as purchasable DLC. Would recommend to anyone
1;Very fun game! it takes a while to learn the mechanics of the game but it's fun and engaging. Also you can play with friends in parties and even trade items with others. Sometimes there's lag on the servers but overall a solid purchase for anyone who enjoys a mix of cars and soccer!
1;Amazing depth and simplicity at the same time. It's soccer with cars. Those cars have rockets strapped to them. Imagine flying through the air and hitting the ball at huge speeds and how hard it is to aim that rocket. Now imagine stopping someone else from doing the same.It's awesome.
1;Rocket League is honestly a spectacular game. Infinite replayability an addictive quality and excellent networking add up to a great experience.Psyonix also made it easy to play with friends either online or via couch co op.The addition of cross platform play makes this game just that much better and guarantees a long lasting high population online community to keep the game relevant.TONS of fun. Please play it!
1;Although difficult at the beginning this game proves to be worth every cent. It is enjoyable to play it and because it is a quite simple and entertaining game to play this game has become my stress reliever game. Playing alone or with friends either way it's exciting.
1;Exactly what it says on the packet. Soccer with Turbo charged cars that can fly and drive on walls. The controls are simple the games are fast paced and it's great to play with friends. It was designed to be an entertaining multiplayer experience that you could play for hours and not realise it and it does that and so much more. 9/10 The devs are spot on with this one.
1;"""*Semi decent hour* """"Just... one... more... round...""""*several hours later* (birds chirping) """"Is that the sun!?""""Great game with friends nothing like the feeling of making an epic save or a great goal. Easy to learn difficult to master. Controller recommended for analog inputs."""
1;"""Rocket Leagues is simply the best thing happened since Quake. Extremely """"simple"""" addictive but next to impossible to master. It grows on you week after week and it's such enjoyment to watch matches from Youtube/Twitch. Give it a chance and put some effort in you gonna love the he** out of it when you get in enough. 10/10"""
1;RL is a amazing game i think its way worth the money because there is a veriety of cars to pick from and dont forget the DLC packsyou can play online or by your self. this game you need a lot of team work.there are all kinds of tricks that you and your friend can learn together.
1;I mean it's football with cars but you just want one more game you just finished one and you lost but you don't care one more game five minutes plus overtime you have to score you focus on the ball you're gonna do that aerial because you're that good but you miss and they score you lose again. Does it matter? No just one more game.I don't even like football.
1;There is a lot of kid playing this game. But if you succeed to ignore them and climb the ladder you reach the better competitive game I've ever seen. Furthermore i got it since its release and the DLCs and updates brought a lot of new stuffs. Don't think buy it hours of fun incoming.
1;I have played 600 hours of this game and i will continue playing I played on the xbox and transfered over here and i do not regret it. Theres an issue with toxicity but the ban/timeout system does work cant wait to see this game at more and more tournaments!
1;It's a fun game multiple gamemodes so you don't get too bored. Pretty good ranking system. One improvement to be made is possibly when people are reported it is rare they are punished. Other than the little raging children I like the game and would reccomend it to others.
1;It's a good game you just always get stuck with people that think they're good when they are and try to talk even though they're the worst player on the team. Pretty fun lags like when you need to make a play or anyone joins in the game. If someone has over 100 ping you might as well back out of the game because it's going to be a horrible experience.
1;Really fun really addictive. One of those games where you end up playing 2 hours when you thought it was only 30 mins. Wouldn't pay more than $14 for it though and the campaign mode kinda sucks. Would be better if there was steam workshop and other stuff to mess around with.
1;Honestly man there's a reason this game has more hours than any other game I've played by a long shot and this reason is the same for most everyone who owns this game it doesn't get old. I can get at this game and shut it off and be back on in under half an hour. If your looking for a game with a huge community and endless replayability this is your best bet. This game has more than payed for itself.
1;Very fun game once you learn all the ins and outs of it. Very addicting the only downside at the moment though is the newly crafted ranked games. Totally unrewarding and almost impossible to advance levels unless you are with a team who know how to play with each other. Even with that I would highly reccoment this game to anyone who wants to have a fun time with friends or just on your own.
1;"""Best example of an """"easy to play hard to master"""" game. Simple rules two nets one ball and tons of fun and skill to gain (and sometimes tons of anger because your teammates don't do what you want them to do and you loose and loose and loose and you end up in silver I and ask yourself why do you even play this??!?!?! But then... Alas... It's still so much fun!)."""
1;great game. i have 1000 hrs. 1/3 of that is probably from leaving it on when i do other things but still a lot of hours! All those hours and i still suck. Its the only mulitplayer competitive game that i feel i dont get cheated out of a win. its the closest thing i have found to a real sport.
1;I have to say what a grabbing game! Seriously it's addictive fun and competitive. I'd say the only bad part might be the competitiveness which makes for a pretty toxic community sometimes but it's rather fun has great game physics a pretty good number of game modes from which to choose from and a deep costumization system. 9/10 for me!

1;Rocket League is a beautiful game to play with friends and I believe is almost impossible to rage at. Except when you get absolutely destroyed in casual by people who you actually admit are way better than you because you cant even touch the ball because they just carry it across the entire field mid air and slam it into your hopeless net. 10/10
1;Playing soccer with rocket cars. That's the basis of this game. I'm not a fan of soccer.. or football for you non American heathens but this game is really addicting. The included hockey mode is truely the best part.Great for drinking and having fun with friends. If you are into esports and competitive gaming I guess this game also has that aspect of it that seems quite popular.
1;Easy to pickup hard to master frustrating to no end hard to put down. I always end up forcing myself to quit because I've played too long and keep losing/don't want to ruin a win streak. Good game for most ages though 10+ would be ideal since it requires some coordination to get the car to cooperate.
1;This is simply the best sports game made since the old maddens on ps2. The ability to control your car is one of the hardest things to grasp. It's one of those games that's is kinda hard to get familiar with but extremely hard to master. Each game is an adrenaline rush that taps into your inner competitiveness.
1;Rocekt league is a fun fast paced game where you are playing soccer with cars. This game has many fun qualities and is really enjoyable to play with friends. Playing against the bots is ok but playing online is the best. I personally enjoy ranked the most. I am currently gold 3 and am having tons of fun trying to rank up with my friends. I hope this is helpful to anyone who is interested in the game
1;Very entertaining game. Even more so with friends. When you're new be prepared to suck at it but you will continue to improve and enjoy it even more as you improve. Awesome graphics and funny items to customize your car. Great devs listening to fans. All around great game! Pretty cheap for all the hours of fun you get.
1;Great game!If you like competition try it!One of the great advantages of this game is that you haven't to be an expert to have fun. At the start I hit the ball at the 10% of my attempts and the game still was fun. When you score your first goal... Just Wow!I play it just to relax after work. Someone could find the cybersport part of the game attractive.Anyway I strongly recommend this game! That's one of few games I've played so much.
1;This is really one of those games that makes me wonder why I love it so much. Rocket League is very abstract from any other sports related games i've played and it's by far my most favorite. Very Unique High Pace and addicting.. Hence my 150+ Hrs. 9/10
1;"""Great game.Rocket League took a seemingly simple idea and turned it into a crazy success.Starting the game you're going to start out by just bonking the ball every chance you get.Give it a couple (hundred) hours and you'll be flying through the stadium with the best.Easy to pick up easy to play impossible to master.Nominated for the """"Just 5 More Minutes"""" award. P.S. yeah its car soccer. Tell your friends!"""
1;Everyone should own this game! Play either casually or Competitively no matter how much time you have to spare. This is def the best game to play if you have less than an hour to kill and feel it is not long enough to start up another game. Get your fix or play a big SESH!
1;Got this game at launch on PS4 for free. Instantly loved it. Never played the first one but man I can't get enough of this game. They have done a good job keeping it alive. The community is always active. I never have a problem finding a game. It's fun as hell. You can just jump in and play a game. The matches are short enough that if you get bored you can play a match or two and be over it in 10 mins. I really love this game. I HIGHLY recomend it.
1;Amazing game that is simple and for car lovers and football lovers is perfect ). Rocket League is a fun game with friends but can make you rage but thats not important. Also i would enjoy if they would add more real life car brands like Mercedes Ferrari or Porsche and other famous cars. Anyway i enjoy playing this game and if you dont own it then you should buy it. ) )
1;This game can be best described with a low skill barrier of entry while still maintaining a high skill tree to climb. It is fun to play with friends and Psyonix continually adding different game modes keeps the game fresh. There are many cosmetic crates that work like CS GO however also include cars that have different hit boxes. The game is fun for everyone but as soon as one person becomes good at the game a simply player can dominate the match.

1;It is a great game. Its all ways cool to watch the RLCS and you can learn from the pros. They are all ways adding more to the game. Love it! I would like a Marshmallo Decal or something tho ) Tip If you play with a teammate that works with you well ADD HIM OR HER. Thats one of the keys to getting higher rank faster.
1;One of em games you gotta play for awhile to get good at let alone njoy it. After 30 hours of playing its one were you will go back to play it every so often. It's definetly a drag at first when the people you play with are hella better then you..but still. Now I enjoy it.
1;Product received for free. this is a strategy game in which you also need thinking the game itself is fun from what I see playing really many players. The system of ranks is sometimes overwhelmed you can get angry but still the game is super i recommend!
1;The game is definitely the only one of its kind. It's physics are mind boggling and pretty convincing at the same time!Would definitely recommend this to anyone out there who wants to try something new. The community is really good and friendly except for a few thorns here and there which don't matter much. Everyone should definitely try this out.
1;"""One of those games that make you say """"Just one more match"""".Easy to pick difficult to master it can be enjoyed at all skills levels. Reallly recommend picking this up if you haven't already feels like an AAA polished game with the price of an indie game."""
1;Like all the best games it can be fun and frustrating but I reckon it would be worth it to improve as muich as you can. Can be played as casually or competitively as you want. Community can be unfriendly at times but you know we are all human. Has its own extremely impressive esports scene however I'm not sure how entertaining a tournament of this would be given the minimal differences between matches. Definately worth a shot though it could be your niche.
1;Even with almost 800 hours in..I still love the game. When you want a game that is easy to learn and understand with quick matches and where your skill progresses by playing more and more.. this is it! I love the competition and the fact that your actions within several minutes influence the outcome of the match. Easilly a game that anyone should have and play.
1;Product received for free. The best game ever The physics in the game is perfet just dont play the game when you have 999 ping cuz thats danger zone you might get salty but thats okay just take a break and watch some videos then come back and play will start winning.For 1v1 you have to play paitiant and for 2v2 and 3v3 its all about teamwork so I suggest playing with friends if your friends arent online or have no time use Gamerlink.HOPE YOU GUYS ENJOY DONT GET TOO SALTY )
1;I will be the first to tell you I'm not much of a sports person. 115 hours in and I still come back to this guy. It's great as a filler game between other longer games (say DOTA) or as a longer binge with friends. I picked it up on sale for myself and later bought another license for retail price. If that doesn't say enough I've also purchased some of the DLCs as I do want to support these guys. That for those that know me is a huge endorsement alone.
1;Originally I only got this game because my friend told me to get it. I was reluctant in purchasing it because cars (meh) soccer (meh) competition (also meh). But after playing if for a while and giving it time I soon realised its an awesome game. Competitive car soccer is like the best thing ever.
1;"""At first I couldn't imagine that this game would be much fun because I compared it somehow with other soccer games. But now I don't wanna miss it ever again! A great and funny game with many different game modes to put the """"soccar"""" ball into the net. Or a cube. Or a hockey puck. Or a basket ball. Or a cube that bounces like flubber...into your goal of course."""
1;Rocket League is one of my all time favorite games. I love to play a quick match sometimes or sit down for a ranked session with my friends. Psyonix supports the game amazingly. You would think that it might get boring but my 200+ hours beg to differ (now almost 500+). 10/10 would play again if I ever stopped playing it in the first place.Still my all time favorite game
1;"""This game will make you hate yourself because you will never be able to hit the shots you want to hit. It will also challenge yourself to try even harder every game because you know you can make it eventually. This game epitomises the attitude of """"1 more game"""" while sitting at 3am the night before your biggest exam."""
1;I think that Rocket League is one of the best games ever. Great for any level of Gamer just introduced to gaming to profesional gamers.I think the new crate system they added is a good compromise for the constant revanue stream model so many games are going towards. Purely cosmetic 0 effect of gameplay unlike Star Wars Battlefront 2 is doing. I Highly reccomend this game to anybody who has enough money to spend
1;You will cry. You will rage. You will smash your controller. You will insult your teammates many times. You will miss the ball by a milimeter. You will bounce around after the failed landing. You will struggle to learn how to fly. You will rage at your controls when you accidentially make a backflip. You will get upranked only to lose it. The opposite team will make you your .But most of all you will come back for more.10/10 Best Masochist Simulator
1;Got this game when it first came out and is one of the games I've played the most in my entire life (it's gotta be good to keep my interest for that long). And with the introduction of crates and keys it's probably the game I've spent the most amount of money on too...
1;I've gotten this game for the PS4 and now the PC. It's always the game I go back to when I get bored of everything else. I can always have fun with Rocket League and the devs are constantly updating or adding more to the game. Play hard in compitive or have some laughs playing Rumble. It's a game that can fit all your gaming needs.
1;This game provides hours of fun and can get very competitive. It can be played while chilling out and listening to music and only takes a few minutes for each game which is perfect. Playing with other people is pretty helpful because some random teammates you get can be trolls or mess up a lot.
1;Most fun I've had with a game for awhile. Brings me back to my old days in CS where you can hop in a group with a couple friends and mess around in game and generally have a good time. Also not pay to win or even rewards you for playing often. To move up the ranks takes skill and there aren't a lot of skill based twitchy games that aren't First Person Shooters.Definitely should be on an addition to your Library or a nice gift for someone this Christmas.
1;"""If you are new at it don't rage when other team + your team starts to spam """"What a save!"""" after you make mistake.AndI don't recommend playing 1v1 because when you make 1 only 1 little mistake it costs a lot then you will rage and maybe you will break your controller or mouse like me..."""
1;I really love this game I could advanced so many hours into this.Pros The Vehicles are really stunningly textured.Soundtrack is perfect.The customization you can do to your vehicles.The arenas are beautifully designedThe A.IThe graphics are just stunning as well.*updated for the awards thing*
1;"""""""Just 5 more minutes""""I can not recomend this game enough.I've had so much fun playing both with friends and solo and after 400+ hours I still have a lot to learn to compete in the higher ranks.Love this game. Wish I could nominate it for multible awards."""
1;So Rocket League.At the time of this review I have played the game for 1005 hours. I have raged laughed and actually won sometimes. I have yet to get bored of this game and can't see a time in the future where I will. If you dont have this game already you should own it. I can almost guarantee you will love it even if you are just messing around with mates for a bit. 10/10
1;This game is incredible and can always change due to its gameplay.Pros Rewarding not pay to win simple design servers are consistentCons Learning curve type game single player could be expandedI reccomend playing with either an Xbox One Controller or PS4 Controller rather than Mouse and Keyboard (personal opinion).
1;Easily one of the best games to play with friends. The true competitive feel to the game allows for a constant replayability. Many customizable parts to your vehicle along with drops that keep you interested. Incredible community as well as continuous updates by the devs. Fantastic game. Truly a fantastic game.Update Even two years later and still amazing.
1;A really great game playable on lower end pcs. The car designs are unique and detailed along with the boost trails. Only complaint I have is I sometimes have trouble playing on starbase but thats probably my fault because im playing on an Inspiron 5000 )
1;Possitive Currently 464.7 hours in game and what can I say. I have way too much fun with this game. In the beginning it is a little difficult to get a grasp of how to effectively play but after that initial learning curve you get to hone in on your tricks/flying/dribbling skills. If you enjoy competitive games then you'll have a blast with this one.Negative The community is toxic and there are only a couple game types.Good Luck!
1;Best game to play both alone or with friends competitive regular games or even co op. Warmly suggest this game and hopefully it keeps getting updated with better and newer stuff added. I think the game makers should even try community items or suggestions from the people.
1;One of the best games I've ever played! It's the perfect mix of simplicity and depth. Easy to learn but frustratingly difficult to master. I've never had more fun with a game that made me want to smash my 360 controller into the floor. On a $$ per hour of gameplay basis there is no better deal. Buy it right now!
1;Rocket League is a game about cars trying to score goals with a ball.Nothing special but unexpectedly it gives a lto more fun and satisfaction than you could expect. Lots of customization options for your vehicles and frequent updates make the game stay fresh. It's a shame that the developers introduced cases simillar to that of the other games. Still i can reccomend this game to anyone who is willing to have fun.
1;Product received for free. Got it for free since it was bundled with my steam controller.Looking back I would also have paid the full price.The game just never stops being fun. Also it neatly supports playing with remote AND local participants so you and a friend can play on your TV while a third one is joining the party from home. 100% recommended.
1;"""This wasn't one of the games on my """"Have to buy when I finish my PC"""" but certeanly tried this game on a free weekend and instantly feel inlove with it Its amazingly fun and crazy getting better at it and scoring a goal with a cool trick its really fun and entretaining.10/10 Buy it even if youre not sure about buying it and for only 20$ (13$ on sale) its a no brainer. Best Game Ever"""
1;TL DR Its a great game. Well worth the money. BUY IT NOWS!Pros +Easy to pickup hard to master+Fun with friends+Demoing people+Using a controller seems superior to a keyboard+Fun modes and decent mix of maps+Only 5 minutes per matchCons Sometimes really bad matchups People trolling via quick chat commands but can negate via disabling chat stuffNovember 23rd 2017 Still great! Get it and have fun!
1;One of the best games to play with friends! The game is easy to pick up and it runs pretty well on low end PCs too.All you need is a controller and a few hours days (possibly weeks) to spare and you're all set for andless fun!Highly recommend it to everyone (if you haven't guessed it already)
1;Rocket League is love. Rocket League is life.Also contrary to popular belief you can find a partner online.. I found mine lurking in a zippy and hogging the ball.However side effects include loss of social life outside of Rocket League dank memes aerial goals own goals crying because you're terrible crying because you're too pro ranked solo standards being awful wishing you had more time to play rage quitting and smashing your controller.

1;Rocket League is very easy to play but very hard to be good at. It is always fun across all skill levels I've played at and can be very exciting during matches. I wouldn't reccomend it without reading other reviews and watching videos of it though. Don't expect to be as good as in some videos coming in to it though.

1;Product received for free. I have played Rocket League for about 2 months now and all I can say is that I'm addicted. As someone who played SSARPBC back on the PS3 I absolutely love the updated graphics and gameplay that make this game one of a kind. 10/10
1;"""What is Rocket League? It's not just car soccer. It's car basketball. And car hockey. And car volleyball (sort of). And Super Smash Cars. It's a game with 5 minute matches that you can play for hours. If you think it's """"just soccer with cars"""" grab a controller and play it for a bit you probably won't be disappointed."""
1;This is my favorite game. And why?U HAVE CARS U HAVE BALL ITS 1V1 2V2 3V3 OR JUST 4V4 AND U CAN GOAL EVERY SECOND IF U WANTU CAN OPEN CASES AND MAKE PROFIT $$$$$$$$$$$$$JUST DOWNLOAD FIND FRIENDS IF U DONT HAVE AND GO REKT OTHER ES ON 2V2 DO DIAMOND BE FAMOUS.But i am just Platinum ((((((((((((((((((KYS.
1;This game is great. I have no issues running it and it is really fun whether you are alone or with friends. The game's community is for the most part really good but does have a small problem of tilting pretty hard occasionally. All in all a great game made even better when you have friends to enjoy it with.
1;I bought this game on the Summer Sale of 2016 and over the summer have played it at least once a day. I love this game. It is very easy to learn how to play but difficult to master just as it should be. I've already made friends playing as well. Its a very fun fast paced take on soccer and rocket cars combined. I would recommend this game to anyone with money to spend. Its a great game.
1;"""I gave this game the """"Test of Time"""" award in the 2016 steam sale because you can always come back to this game for a fun time. They are always adding new modes and new ways of having fun. You can try hard in competitive mode or you can just relax and chill with some friends in the other modes."""
1;I was a BETA tester on PS4 now playing on steam.... this game and the developers continue to impress me. Fantastic value for money consistent updates of FREE new maps FREE game modes FREE seasonal items along with purchasable DLC and cosmetic crates. You can play for fun you can play seriously (ranked mode) with friends without friends you can play online or offline. Or you can simply sit in the menu screen and listen to a freaking kick sound track! You will not regret purchasing this game.
1;"""Great game both for casuals and for people who really want to hone their skills and compete against other people in a highly competitive environment. The game runs well even on a low end machine.I nominated this game for the """"Just 5 more minutes"""" award because it really is an addicting game where a single game doesn't take a lot of time but you always want to go for one more game shortly after finishing an exhilarating match."""
1;"""This game is very unique in the way that it can be very casual or very competitive. Item system is really the only con in this game. Items worth thousands of dollars and forces people into the """"biggest quot contest which is annoying. Overall a great game and one of few games that I have stuck with since its release."""
1;Soccer in rocket cars! The games are short so you are always stuck in a one more game loop. But that's not a bad thing. Rocket League is a fun fast and exciting game. Easy to learn hard to master. Better with friends but sill fun and good on your own.
1;Game is good. Community is trash. Easy to pick up and play difficult to master. Cars have different stats which the game doesn't tell you yet they're going for e sports bucks. Takes practice to decide which car is best for you. Worth it on sale. I think the dev's have gone over board with the microtansactions and lootboxes.
1;"""The closest thing to the mechanics of a sport that you can find in a video game. Every other game is hard to play because in the back of my mind I keep thinking """"I want to be playing Rocket League."""" I own it for PS4 and have played that since August 2015. I have no idea how many hours I have on there but that I still am playing it endlessly is a sign that it's well worth the $20."""
1;Not usually a sports game fan but this game is addictive as all getout. Easy to figure out hard to master. Each match is unique and fun. Graphics are excellent. Can jump on and get into a game in a matter of seconds. Full controller support so I can switch instantly in game between keyboard and controller. My go to game when I have a few moments to spare.Recommended for everyone who has opposable thumbs and enjoys fun.
1;Just an incredible experience. I love highly competitive games that let you churn out multiple games in small time windows and this game scratches that itch.The physics engine is the highlight of this package. New modes are introduced at a frequent rate and paid DLC is optional as it should be.This is a recommendation I spam to my gamer friends as there's almost no risk of someone simply not liking it.
1;"""I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this game yet but Rocket League was my GOTY for 2015 and I'm still playing it in 2017! It's such a fun game with that whole """"simple to play but tough to master"""" thing going on. Definitely recommended for someone just looking to have some fun online or even for someone looking for stiff competition."""
1;Do you like football? Do you like crippling losses and the occational epic VICTORY? Then this game is perfect for you especially if you have a heart problem you will do after 3 games of competitive pros Fast and epic gameplaygood graphics super matchmakinggreat cars with customisationcons lucky goals What a save!Alot of DLC
1;A game with much potential I can say a minus for this game when you are playing casual 1v1 2v2 etc you have the possibility to play against highest levels like platinum / diamond (on ranked) with level 50 60 70+ whatever is so nice to play and I recommend it for all players which want to purchase this game 10/10!
1;This game was really fun up until recently. Since this new update all i get put into (in public matches) is losing games and people way below my rank. How can i have fun when all of this causes high blood pressure. I loved it before this recent update. UPDATE Hey its fixed now and all the stars are aligned again. WOOOOOOOOO
1;Rocket league is that one game that I just can never get enough of. I play it and I play more of it and I just keep coming back every week. It's not a game I could play all the time but it has enough elements to it that I still love playing it every time.
1;This is easily one of the best and most addicting games I've ever played in my entire life. Not only is there a MASSIVE learning curve that takes a lot of time to learn (which inevitably adds way more hours) there is also tons of customization options for you to unlock. This game will keep you HOOKED. 10/10.
1;This game words can not describe the feeling you get when you play this game I play this alone and with friends both were fu*ing awsome!I played the game for 45 hours and still enjoy the fu*k of this game. If you haven't bought this game FU*ING BUY IT
1;Just waiting for a race modeBetter with friendsTakes time to learn most people either are good or are bad games been out a while so youll struggle if youre just beginingToo many microtransactions(however kinda only cosmetic but provides hitbox variation)Great customizationBalanced
1;One of those games you can play really competitively or really casually and either way it is an incredibly fun experience. Weak server performance and lagging issues can be a prominent issue at times but it's hard to notice and any personal PING problems can be fixed with a simple internet extender and an ethernet cable. Unlike EA this game's in game purchases are solely cosmetic and will not give any advantage in gameplay to anyone.
1;"""""""This game looks cool I'll buy it to play with friends in splitscreen once in a while""""Did not really play with friends but this game was still my discovery of the year you can play 100s of hours and still have a lot to learn.Awesome game!10/10 would buy again"""
1;Never have I ever written a review on here before but I felt compelled. Let me be clear here I do not like sports games in the slightest. I would go as far as to say that I hate sports games. I don't find them fun. Rocket League is a soccer game with rocket powered cars and it completely flipped that notion of mine on its head. This game is SO much freaking fun. Highly recommend to anyone at all!
1;This is my most played game for good reason. It's simply just so much fun and well made. It has an excellent skill curve that makes it very rewarding to play. There's a handful of toxic players but it's a popular online game that's going to happen. Great controls physics and customization. Psyonix you've made a gem.
1;"""GET this game! Even if you think you won't really like it once you start playing you won't be able to stop its an addictive game and the good part is there is no """"higher level"""" gear which gives anyone a leg up so it stays really competitive.10/10 !"""
1;This is a very challenging game but very fun to play. There is the beginnertime where you aren't that good at the game and might get annoyed quickly but once you get passed that it is an amazing experience every game again. Especially if you play it with friends.
1;Rocket League is just one of those games which is fun to play with friends for the first 100 hours then you just stop playing because you are bad at the game then play it again non stop for about 3 weeks then realise you cant rank up plat then get triggered at the game then suddenly bang 1000 hours wasted time just go get a ing reward which is purple... But still fun game
1;This game is genuinely a work of art. Every time you load it up its that same wonderous feeling you get the first time you played it.I honestly recommend this game to all of my friends it has a perfect balance of competitive and chilled out games and is the best time killer &amp marathon game to date.
1;What to say about Rocket League It certainly is fun There are some microtransactions but it is very little minority of the content you can go without it or choose one or two extra skins Huge plus is community not as toxic as in other games (Looking at you CS GO) In general a lot of bang for you buck fun both online and split screen Very helpful training
1;This game is really funny and perfect if you need a game to relax or take a break from competetive games. From what I could experience so far this game has not been making me mad yet. Which is great since I keep finding myself laughing at moments where I fail miserably.10/10 would bang.
1;Best game ever.500+ hours and still having funNice one! Savage! What a save!Chat disabled for 4 secondsChat disabled for 4 secondsChat disabled for 3 secondsChat disabled for 2 seconds Chat disabled for 1 secondChat disabled for 1 secondChat disabled for 1 secondChat disabled for 1 secondWow!
1;I hate soccer but this is sooo fun and only 5 min matches get in get out.. Pros Split screen + Online Split screen EPIC COUCH FUNThe handling is so perfect that I want racing maps and costum maps like in Distance racing parkour game...and maybe add Neon lights under the RC cars for some awesome costum race maps drift actions Dand wheel color change options like in GTA VCons My bad eng xD
1;This game is amazing and fun from the start. There are so many moves and plays you can do that you are always in the feeling of improving your skill. You never get tired of it no sarcasm.It's really easy to start playing it but it'll take a long time to truly master it.
1;Rocket League (+) Dynamic Gameplay. ( ) Microtransactions.(+) Overhauled Progression System. ( ) Toxic Community. (At Times)(+) Good Team Oriented Gameplay. ( ) Alternating Hitboxes On Different Vehicles.(+) Balanced learning Curve. ( ) Competitive Ranking System Is Questionable.(+) Multiple Playing Styles. ( ) Can Cause Frustration. (At Times)'What a save!''What a save!' 'What a save!'
1;"""Great game lots of fun but whoever the retard is in charge of physics needs to go back to highschool. Seriously you can do everything that a """"pro"""" would do but if its not your number on their dice roll your physics are screwed and every shot will wormhole to your own net."""
1;Well more than a year post release and the devs are still adding meaningful content and supporting the game with patches and community communication. I'm not personally a fan of crates and keys and that whole system but it's fairly easily ignored. Overall 9/10.
1;I originally got this game on Xbox when it first released. I was having so much fun with the game I bought it on steam when I bought my pc. The in game items are really addicting to collect and I dont mind spending money on keys. This game is fun whether you play solo or with friends. One thing I do wish is that there were some more game modes and even racing. 10/10 game overall.
1;As soon as I saw this product I was hooked onto it. It is very smooth and you don't need a very good computer to play it at 60fps. Once you score that first goal it really motivates you to score another. I think this game is very fun to play and still has a lot of players after 2 years of its initial release.
1;"""As a soccer fanatic everytime I watch soccer I hear """"Nice shot!"""" """"Whoops..."""" and spams of """"Sorry!"""" everytime I watch the premier league MLS or LA LIGA games. I am glad Rocket League is in my life! Ranking System is nice can be a grind but it really does help getting a party with microphones and cordinate as a team. Highly recommended!!! &lt 3!!"""
1;Probably the most fun I've had playing a game in years. Perfect combination of easy to learn and hard to master. The basics of the game are obvious but it'll take a lot of practice to be able to master the aerial shots and proper techniques to rock the socks off your opponents.
1;Easy to play hard to master.Probably the best game you can get for the price. Do not consider this as a sports game it's much faster paced than anything that has to do with Soccer and is also one hundred times more fun than anything that has to do with Soccer.Nice Shot! Wow!Wow!Chat has been disabled.
1;An amazing game. It is very simple yet hard to master. I can feel myself getting better and rarely do I have anyone to blame for not being good other than myself or my teammate(s). I've put a lot of hours into this game and I cannot imagine it will get boring anytime soon.
1;Simply an amazing game to play with or without friends. Different game modes and different maps make it an amazing party game plus the incredibly high skill ceiling in the competitive ladder make the game a must have for people like me who love very competitive games but also like to chill out from time to time. You definitely won't regret getting it. I'd recommend to play with a controller though.
1;Best game really short loading screens no need for an high end PC though you might experience some frame drops on lower end if its too low and you can pick it up play for 5 minutes and turn it off. It won't happen if you're in a hurry though ) Great game I advise everyone to try it!!!
1;This game has great replay value. Play with friends or online and you'll have a blast. Even a bad game isn't bad coz it only lasts 5mins and even if you can't hit the ball driving around with cutesy cars is great fun. Coupled with good music and it's really good. YOu probably already have it but if you don't Get it. Rocket League is worth every penny.
1;"""I was playing with one of my friends. He called me """"Bruh"""" I called him """" """".2 days later""""Banned for 1d 0hBecause a player generated report found your in game comments extremely offensive your account has been suspended!""""System works 10/10Got banned for 3 times in the first week.Now I always shut my mouth C#RIP ALK"""
1;Product received for free. I hate this game its a money scam You wont be able to get any good items. JUST HOPE. DONT EVEN THINK ITS POSSIBLE I NEVER GOT THEM I HAVE BEEN PLAYING FOR 3 YEARS WHAT THE HECK DO YOU WANT FROM ME?The Main game and stuff are fun but the car stuff is it should make it so you dont spend your money on every single thing because its bull crap
1;This game here. No matter how many times I leave it I always come back in a few days. No other game gives you the satisfaction of watching your skills improve as much as Rocket League. I'm pretty sure thats the addictive side of it seeing what crazy new move you'll pull off next.
1;This is a very fun game that can appeal to just about anyone. It also has enough depth and a high ceiling of skill that it can take very long to master. One of the few games left out there that will make you really appreciate games where you come across another player more skilled than yourself.
1;I bought the game back in 2016 with a friend of mine but we both sucked and stopped playing. Until another friend of mine who's really good at the game brought me back. Now I'm doing pretty good (I think?) so overall it's a really great game. I'd say it's better with friends even.
1;One word wow!Four words Roller coaster of emotions!The game is really simple but yet so deep. There's parctically no limits to how much you can improve as you practice. It's a really fun game to play with friends but sometimes can be really frustrating as you lose 5 to 8 when you were leadind 4 to 1 on the duel mode. I would recommand to anyone ready to invest some time to practice and get better at it.
1;Rocket League is probably my second most played game ever coming in behind Team Fortress Classic which I played thousands of hours so many years ago. Real life and time constraints keep me from racking up as many hours as possible this time. Digital crack!
1;I love games Skateboarding Guitar playing Singing Music Sports i excel at them all. Not going to go indepth here but i have alot of experience and backround in the competitve and artistic realm. Rocket League has prodvided fun the platform to create with depth and to freestyle actually it reminds me alot about skateboarding. Don't give up have fun and if you play it with friends holy talk about a good ing time! This game is amazing i love it.
1;Product received for free. It is a skill requiring game. Optimization is pretty cool (I was actually thinking my pc wouldnt open it but i get like 60fps in full graphics). If you wanna have a sick looking car you will want to spend some money. Nice cars good physics. Definitely recommending.
1;This is a really fun game that everyone should give a chance. It is packed with fun gamemodes and content keeps coming regularly. Whats also great is that the learning curve in this game is really high. This is a game i have found myself coming back to again and again for the thrill of some intense competetive matches. I have played it for far longer than i should have too haha!
1;Hard to explain something so simple. You're a car playing football with wonky physics. Easy to grasp but with a learning curve that never ends. Honestly one of the best games around! The ranking systems pretty good you can jump up (and down) the leagues without weeks of gameplay a real plug and play game with years left in it!
1;One of the most addicting games I have played. The reason is because of playing ranked games all the time. Certain games ranked takes forever to play but in Rocket League these games take the same amount of time as a regular game and regular games do not take that long. Sometimes it gets toxic but not always.
1;This game is absolutely crazy In a good way. They add many customizations and modes this makes the game extremely fun and addictive. Not to mention that when you play and practice you can become really skilled and this only makes it funner to play. There may be a few scammers running around but just be careful and it wont be a problem. This game is definitely worth the $19.99 for it has infinite gameplay and is phenomenal.
1;Awesome Game Played More Than 300 Hundred Hours And Still Playing One Of The Best Game Ever On SteamAddictive Skillfull Needs A lot Of Patience To Learn At First After Learning The basics U R Pretty Much gGood To Go For Competetive Online And Set Your Rank...
1;This is by far the most hours I have ever put into a single game. The freedom the controls give the player is incredible. If you can master them unlike myself you can pull off some truly spectacular moves. Also I personally get the most enjoyment when I'm in a group. I like 1v1 well enough but it's not as fun as pulling off a well coordinated team play.
1;Pros Awesome GameplayGreat GraphicsFun TradingTeaming with other people is a ton of funLoads of modesNo need to pay or trade after installing for a better item everything is evenAmazing Car Customasation So many diffrent cars but they are ballanced and you are not at a disadvantage using one car over anotherCons It is hard to get really good items without payingServers require really good internetI would say buy now but it is on sale so just get it.
1;When my little brother comes over I set my dual monitor resolution to 3840 x 1080 so we each get our own monitor for split screen! 10/10 will continue to neglect the rest of my steam libraryEdit After playing this game for 1000+ hours it's still just as fun as day 1 if not more so. It's like becoming good at an actual sport you start out terrible but get the hang of the basics pretty quickly. Then you can spend a lifetime improving with no skill ceiling in sight.
1;Psyonix continues to release quality updates that make the game feel fresh. Being able to master different techniques as you play make the game very rewarding to play competitively and Psyonix makes sure to incorporate update and new game modes for casual gameplay as well.
1;Flying cars with rocket boost??? sounds lame when you say it out loud but once you're in it's bumper time go time!!! Your heart races your pits sweat your vein on your temple pulstates you yell at people asking you to pause the game.Highly recommened with friends and drinks.Also I want my nomination box checked.
1;Great game. Matchmaking system is one of the best I have seen. It always feels like you could have won a game even if you do not. I am never really matched up with players heavily out of my skill bracket or under. The mechanics are easy to learn and extremely difficult to master. You can always improve even if you do not play every day.
1;"""Like racing games? What about soccer games? Doesn't matter just get this and laugh it off till ya git average gud and start being an elitist little who thinks he's consistently mvp even when throwing an easily work around able game over narcissism totally worth it tho.Would stare at the words """"noob team"""" 100x a day again without a care in the world. Still am."""
1;"""Rocket league is a tense game of soccer mixed with rocket powered cars.Lots of options to change the look of your cars and lots of variations a great range of game modes that'll keep you on your toes.Highly recommended game that'll make you go """"Just one more game!"""""""
1;When I bought this game I had no idea what to expect I didn't understand why my sister liked this game so much...Now after 400+ hours of playing I think I understand.I still can't fly or quickchat though... So I'd give it a 9/10 Tutorials are for noobs I missed my chance )
1;This game is really good to chill on and its amazingly optimised so you dont need to worry about fps unless you're on a toaster haha. It has ranked as well but thats where all the toxic players are and you sometimes feel like punching your monitor/their faces through your minitor.... xD you have been warned. It's also really good to test your skill and to see improvement makes it really fun!
1;Product received for free. Making Soccer fun again Rocket League invites everyone to have fun. I mostly play Rumble as I prefer it to the other game modes. I believe that this game has great potential. The community is just about like any other community you could expect from a cross platform game. Provided that I have received this game for free I believe it is worth the money and it's fun to play when you have some down time with friends.
1;Imagine a tennisball flying through the air.Now you grab another tennis ball throwing it at the first hitting it and deflecting it into a third mid air tennis ball thrown by your friend. The first tennis ball is now deflected into a rubbish bin. The rubbish bin explodes.That's Rocket League.
1;Rocket League is simply one of the best games I ever played. And in addition to its awesomeness it really doesn't cost that much. If you play with friends you will always have a lot of fun. You can play for hours and never get tired of it.And well you can fly in a car which is cool. 10/10 Just 5 More Minutes Award
1;Rocket League is a Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars! with multi player Combine Cars with Football other countrys they call Soccer with amazing gameplay .Until now they have 1 vs 1 2 vs 2 3 vs 3 and 4 vs 4 + Mods .This game is so addicting .
1;This game is great fun.There is no other game that I can pick up and play and worry about not having fun. Rocket League is so over the top ridiculous that even when down in a match I'm still laughing maniacally to the chagrin of those I'm partied with.
1;"""&gt 2v2 match&gt Carries team&gt Scores 5 Points single handedly&gt I think to myself """"Game is going well ez win""""&gt Teammate leaves game&gt """"Oh well I'm ahead I've got this""""&gt Other team scores&gt """"Still good.""""&gt Goal #2&gt """" .""""&gt Goal #3&gt """"No.""""&gt Goal #4&gt """"I swear to god.""""&gt (22 seconds left)&gt Goal #5&gt Loses in overtime10/10 would rocket car soccer game again."""
1;"""Great game very addictive. The typical """"just one more"""" game.I got this on PS4 first but I had almost noone to play with that's why I got it on Steam too. Totally worth it. Much more fun when you can play this with friends.The more you play the better it gets."""
1;Some of the best times I ever had doing mp gaming and I usually hate playing with or against other people online.Simple to learn hard to master like it should be!Als Multiplayer Hasser und nach weit �ber 100 Stunden Multiplayer Spa� kann ich das Spiel uneingeschr�nkt empfehlen.Mehr Langzeit und Spontan Spa� bekommt man kaum!
1;The most non violent fun (except for those demolitions) I've had in years.If you haven't played Rocket League you should definitely try it. If it is not for you okay at least you tried but if you like it prepare for endless hours of fun (and sometimes rage).The physics are a little bit wanky at times but this does barely impact the gameplay.So try it and enjoy!
1;Rocket League is an amazing game that I have been having a lot of fun with recently. By far my favorite part is meeting new people and making new friends. But there is one amazing thing about this game that makes it unique. The trading aspect. It is implemented right in the game and not made as a sub system and put in the Steam market. You have to trade in game which is really cool. I definetely recommend this game.
1;The game is constantly updated and made better every time. Psyonix really knows what they are doing and they have made my favourite game of all time. Rocket league is the story of a young car training to avenge his father's death by the hands of the ball. &lt SORRY FOR SPOILERS&gt anyway the gameplay is amazing it takes some practice but believe me it is worth it. Buy this game
1;very very fun. Rocket league is a competitive game but i really enjoy the casual aspect. It is fun to just lay back and have fun with friends in this game or if you like to be competitive the competitive ladder is hard to climb but satisfying as you go up higher in the ranks and become better at the game. In my opinion Rocket League is more than worth $20
1;This is a very fun game it is a nice game to go ok i have 20 mins lets play a few rounds i do recommend getting the steam controler as it is much easier to play with the controller then the mouse and you will find that you do become a better player. Also one last thig you really do get those WOW did i just do that feeling with this game nobody know what will happen xD
1;Amazing game of soccer with cars. Enjoyable for newcomers and continues to entertain once you have advanced your skills. As with any online game you can get terrible teamates although the matchmaking is one of the best i've experienced. I recommend playing with friends.
1;Three words Best game ever.At first Rocket League was a little tough for me but the tutorials help so much to prepare you to play with others online. The difficulty is goldilocks like just right. Rocket League is challenging gripping and a game like no other. There are so many options for cars and unlike other games that charge you an arm and a leg for DLC Rocket League's cars are very cheap.Bottom line I'm extremely happy i purchased this game and I would recommend it to anyone.
1;This game swallowed me whole the moment I saw it. It's the kind of game that looks shallow from the outside but ends up having a lot of depth when you get into it. 533 hours and I'm still learning new skills and tricks. The feeling you get when you pull of something you thought you could never do is very addictive. Especially when you're playing with a friend. (you can brag about it)533 hours for 20 bucks. Not a bad deal you can have way less fun for more!
1;Been playing this for quite a few months now. And I can say this this game is totally different than any other games.The idea of this game sounds kind of funny at the start but once you get the hang of it you will realize this game is totally dependent on skills and mechanics and can not be any more fun. Definitely worth your purchase.
1;Very good game!Slow but fun learning curve. It's easy to play this game until you realise that there are a lot of mechanics moves etc. to discover which aren't easy to master. However this results in a long time fun to play this game and improve yourself.Really recommend to buy and play it with friends.
1;Have over 1000 hours of this game and im still going for more cuz i really like it even if the people are toxic which doesn't harm me because you can always mute them well i recommend this game because it's so fun whit friends and alone you improve almost everyday but you need to practice if u wanna be the best!
1;Starts Playing*0 hrI'm so bad at this game!50 hr*I'm pretty good.100 hr*I'm actually bad.150 hr*I might actually be good?200 hr*No I'm actually garbage.250 hr*Ok finally hit diamond for a second. I must be good right?300 hr*Still bad...The cycle continues... 10/10 Would be simulataneously good and bad again.
1;"""Really fun game if you like soccer cars well this game is for you. For real my friend said about this game and from 2016 i knew it while i though that soccer dont like it cars dont like it too . so i didn't buy it while 2017 Sep i though i about it again and said """"why not?"""" so i bought it and i liked it. i really recommend this game for everyone."""
1;Great game! Te only problem is the community. Everyone is a crybaby and will report you for telling them they suck. Psyonix will also take action against you (temp ban perm ban) for the stupidest things. Gotta cater to the crybaby 10 year olds who get butthurt at every little thing.
1;The best game i have ever played.One of the most engaging communities i have ever been a part of. Unlimited Gameplay for just 20$the best.just outstanding. Graphics super good.Optimization GoodFPS easily getting 100 120+ frames. (check my profile bio for my specs)Enjoyment TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE!
1;"""This game is a ton of fun and you can get lost in it for sure SPOILER ALERT You will lose sleep to this game!A few bugs here and there such as """"distance traveled"""" on certain items you get and equip without leaving a match/server not updating but overall really polished.My Sweet Ride!!"""
1;Rocket League is a blast. The gameplay is simple enough yet I can't seem to stop playing it. Fun casual competition very refreshing. Rocket League is easy to pick up hard to master. The game is extremely polished and finished which almost feels unique in this current gaming climate. Definitely a must buy in 2015.
1;I cannot reccommend this game enough.If you dont already have it i suggest you watch a pro's clips on youtube The things it is possible to do in this game given enough practice are simply amazing.Gameplay is fast paced and the 5 minute matches are the perfect length to play the game to pass time.Buy this game now. Seriously.
1;One of the best competitive games I have played in a long time. Csgo is the only other one that I can think of that is as good. It seems really balanced and based totally on skill. Happy that this game already has an ESL pro league for it and can't wait to see some of the insane people play it. 10/10
1;Rocket League was rotting in my library until a close friend of mine forced me into playing it. Now I'm playing on the daily. It's a fun competitive and challenging game with really cool events going on here and there. Controller recommended...unless you really hate yourself.
1;There are some issues with this game the matchmaker is often unbalanced the physics are surprisingly inconsistent for a physics based game it's far easier to derank than rank up there are some really bad teammates the ranking system doesn't protect you against AFK or DC players. However the good outweighs the bad in this game. It will provide countless hours of fun! I would highly recommend it.
1;Too put it short this is a game that requires no skill but a ton of time to play to say that i haven't even scratched the surface of what is within this game with more than 130 hours I would think that its safe to say that you wont get bored of this title any time soon.
1;By far my favorite game. Great way to kill an hour or take a 5 minute break from whatever you're working on. Despite its seemingly simle mechanics the game has a lot more depth than one would initially expect. Easy to pick up and become decent at but expect it to take a couple of months before you start mastering it.
1;I've hit some crazy shots while playing with friends and I make it look like I'm good at the game but in reality I was just moving my car in random directions hoping I'd hit the ball away from my goal. If you suck at games but wanna feel pretty good this is your calling.
1;As you can see I have multiple hundreds if not thousands of hours in this game. Not only is it fun in the casual respect (the gamemode I play the most) but the Ranked gameplay is just as enjoyable. Great community in a whole minus the few toxic people here and there but those seem to be a part of everything now a days.Made many good friends through this game and getting on to play it is still enjoyable! )
1;This is an awesome game but ever since ive had it i have to say that there has been a TON of problems with it. Whenver updates come out it seems like you cant get a game that is stutter free. Also my game has been crashing a bunch. This sucks because you get banned from matchmaking as if you quit even though you didn't. The servers and the game engine needs work.
1;"""Incredibly fun game before I got the apparently unfixable """"Not logged in to Rocket League Server"""" error. For me the game is useless now and a waste of 20 dollars plus the DLC I purchased. The error came about after the last update if that helps with anything. Was fixed by verifying integrity of Game Cache. It apparently forced an update which fixed all issues."""
1;I got the game as a gift from a friend and even played it before (I must admit with shame that it was pirated because I had no money back then). I immediately fell in love and could not get myself to stop playing all day. Now that I have the original game I am more attached to the screen and I never get bored! This game is truly amazing I absolutely recommend it for anyone!
1;i have problem in the game i was play fine and good and everything is good but today i open the game and see the controller doesn't work in game but it work in steam what that mean !!and i try to connect steam support and i was surprised i can't !! please any help !!
1;Endless fun great multiplayer (local and online) entertaining mechanics that are fun as both a novice and as an experienced player and loot drops after every game for customization. Don't see myself getting tired of this anytime soon. A steal for the price highly recommended.
1;Very fun game. Several different options (team sizes game modes) for you to choose from. Basic game is pretty straight forward but there are several learning curves you hit as you get better. As with all online games you end up playing with some toxic people but far more games are enjoyable than not.
1;What do you think of when you see cars in a game? Probably of a Racing Game.But Psyonix developed a really nice game where you use cars to play soccer.I actually don't like soccer that much but that game EPIC!9/10 points. Only the physics are sometimes a bit strange.
1;One of the best competitive multiplayer games I've ever owned. Always tons of new content coming out and it's all either free or optional. All DLC is optional. All the loot boxes and random drops are purely cosmetic. You can be the best in the world at this game and only ever spend whatever the base price is (or less if it's on sale which it always seems to be.) All you need is many many many hours of time and practice...
1;I am annoyed because people are so bad at this game and when i disconnect i get qn qutomqtic ban. Seriously psyonix you need to fix this otherwise i will report this bug to microsoft and take legal action. Players do not deserve this and it makes you look bad.I am joking but the ban thing is annoying tho
1;This game is great and i spent most of my time on it.Graphics are amazing and simple nothing special everything great. Gameplay is Easy to learn Hard to master and once you mastered it the possibilities to play are infinite from scoring an aerial goal to a ceiling shot. Comunity can be toxic but i rarely found someone toxicGreat game to play with friends or and get friends to play with.
1;An absolute great game no doubt the game is about soccer with cars but with a little twist ROCKETS. that is what makes this game so different and fun lots of salty people leaving the match when the other team is winning. 11/10 m8 my r8 m8 deal with it m8 r8 m8 dab on dem h8ers but the one thing i dont like is that this game is turning into a money grab cause of the premium pass crap pls rep me pls
1;"""This game is more addicting than heroin!Jokes aside this game is pretty good I found myself playing over 100 hours on the game.Just know every now and then you'll find that sarcastic cheeseball of a man who will say """"Nice shot!"""" even when you barely tap the ball towards your own goal.14/10"""
1;Rocket League is the best skill based game I have ever played. There is no RNG. You want to play like a pro? You will need to practice.I have been playing for 250hrs.+ and I am still finding fun new things to do and play around with. Psyonix are attempting to fix server lag. However getting away from lag it is a MUST BUY.
1;I have been playing this game since it came out for free on PlayStation Plus about 3 years ago. This is by far the game iv sunk the most hours into with my lvl 75 on ps4 and my lvl 62 on pc and im still learning new things all the time. Game is especially fun if you can get 1 or 2 friends to play with you and to improve together. Im wasting my life on this game 1/10
1;Uhhh steam wont open this game error 51 all the time i have to uninstall it to play again and sometimes that doesnt work i also tried what people reccomeneded on the subreddit and it doesnt work. The game for me though is absolutely amazing and the time i actually do get to play is great. I have know found a wierd way to open rocket league and it is by logging out of steam then opening rocket league because i have the shortcut on my desktop.
1;"""I thouroughly enjoy this game. It is all I play. You could say that it has taken over my life. I had to get rid of the kids because they were always asking me for things. """"Can we have food daddy?"""" they would ask. Always asking. Always sniveling and crying about one thing or another from the basement. They had to go.But anyways great game 69/10."""
1;"""This game is honestly one of my favorites due to how simple but extremely replayable it is. It's one of the few skill based games I can get around because it's allows you to be creative in your wins as well as skilled. If you're not into """"skill"""" based games I would still reccommend it because of the other more luck based gamemodes like rumble. Overall I highly reccommend this to anyone trying to have some fun especially since it will have cross platform parties very soon!"""
1;Great game very high skill ceiling that keeps expanding and expanding. The only bad thing I can think of is that a decent amount of your teammates are toxic/passive aggresive but thats all. You also wont need a very good pc for this game.Higly recommended.
1;Hands down the best game of 2015 so far. A pure Physics simulator based on raw skill the learning curve in this crazy car football game is a modest ramp from learning the balance of the car weight of the ball all the way till you are soaring through the sky hitting crazy aerial goals and mastering your positioning. An emerging E sports game too!
1;Absolutely brilliant completely addictive and always bound to get emotions out of you whether exhiliration or frustration and the one more go factor is high in this one. Simple yet deep fun for newcomers and veterans alike. Slight adjustments needed to make ranked play a bit more consistent but otherwise nothing to flaw in this game. Smooth and well presented. Pretty much faultless for what it is and the best game I've played in over a year. Definitely reccomended at a more than fair price!
1;This game is a fun game that you will always go back to whether or not you will because it's addicting and I love it u need a good graphics card if u want to get the best of rocket league because the graphics is amazing and I mean amazing it's such a fun game that u will all like so buy it install it and play it and u won't have any regrets
1;"""Peace be upon you The game itself is very fun and fun to playI know how to play very well in this game and this is my favorite game.From two days ago I came to play a game like every day and suddenly the background screen of Rocket LeagueDoes not work for me I try to press rewrite """"press any key to start"""".And I press and nothing happens I thought it was a fault and I went out and went in and it still does not work.I would be happy if you try to do it if it is please.Thank you Assaf Artov"""
1;I love this game 100%. Amazing dlc choices awesome music and maps thousands of customizations for your cars and caring devs just pure awesomeness. Unboxing crates is totally worth it even if you don't get the best loot it's still great loot. Worth a buy at full price or sale! DIt's hard when you start playing but just practice and you'll be on a roll.
1;Rocket League's reputation speaks for itself at this point. The idea didn't immediately appeal to me but once you (with a controller) feel the handling of the car the physics of the ball and how thrust/air control works you just want to get better at it constantly and learn more. The community can be toxic and there can be some really selfish players but all in all I can whole heartedly recommend Rocket League and praise the developers for the immense value of their product.
1;In terms of matchmaking it can be hit and miss where you're up against 2 rookies or you're playing a team of flying bellends. Despite this the game is a great one to pick up it's nuts it's crazy but when you're able to do a small bit of flying and can time shots or just about aim passes to perfection you get a thrill. Probably best with friends on some chat service but that doesn't stop you!..may have to reinstall this
1;At first I was sceptical on getting this game. Cars with soccer?! not my thing. I thought I would get bored with it after a few hours but it is an amazing game especially with friends. Im surprised it is still holding up after being out for so long! If you want a fun competitive game with nonstop fun go buy this with a buddy or two and have some fun!
1;Win one game. Lose the next. Repeat process until you're a) throwing your controller across the room b) ranked at bronze.Also love it when you're playing Grand Champions as a diamond and they're just doing flips and making the ball move like some telekinetic sons of b****** whilst you're squirming around in the goal looking like the pathetic piece of **** you are.10/10
1;I really love the concept of this game. Really addictive. Playing Soccer Hockey and Basketball with RC type cars. Then you can customize the cars to your liking with free unlocks. This is one of the games I usually play when I have don't have any particular game I want to play then I find myself playing 10 20 games. Different game modes for everyone's play style.
1;Great mechanics really takes skill to play this game. Took me a few days to get a hang of the game and start playing. Has endless hours of entertainment mainly due to it's competitive play matching me against players that give me a reason to strive to get better. Semi decent servers I live in Canada so sometimes I have a higher ping but that's not really a bad thing more just my location.
1;The only reason I've come across people not liking Rocket League is that they're not good at it.Has a huge learning curve you will not pick it up for the first time and be good.Originally saw the simplicity and thought the game was a huge joke a hilarious one though.Realized quickly how epic it could be.One of the only games I continue to play a year after I started.Literally the greatest game ever. 11/10
1;I now have this game on all systems its available for. After finally playing on pc its highly unlikely i will go back to playing on console. World of difference. Feels like an entirely new game. Also i feel like my skill level plateaued on console since playing on pc i have noticed myself getting even better than i was before.
1;This game can be very fun. From the first time playing to pro level. You can play it casually or competitively. The learnning curve can be scary if you watch some of the amazing plays but the matchmaking here is good in general. The graphics are good gameplay smooth the developers are very involved only paid DLC are aesthitcs which is rare nowadays.
1;How does this game keep getting better!? The thing is it was superb out the box yo. If you don't have it you've probably heard about recently or since forever it seems. Get a copy for yourself because the core game is so solid. Get a steam controller too while you're at it if you need one because it works perfect here.
1;Rocket League is a really great game if you like to get the time going.Yet i'm kinda dissapointed. The competetive ranks system is the worst (Please fix &lt 3). You dont get extra points for having winstreaks but when you lose 2 games you must play 3 5 matches to get back what you've lost which does not make ANY sense.
1;A game with simle premises but vast complexity.Quick paced but games last for a very convenient 5 7 minutes.It is fun at every skill level and improving that skill is a never ending quest of improving mechanics and awareness.For chilling with friends or grinding towards that sweet sweet Grand Champion!
1;I have never had this much fun with any other game. If I know that I have only half an hour of spare time this is my default (and only) choice.And the best thing It's all about improving your skills. No grinding to buy upgrades (there are none). Just play it get better and you are able to compete with better opponents. But this does take time.
1;It's a fun and some what addicting game. The game itself runs fine even with a potato while providing very nice visuals. So far the only problem I got is the way that games are balanced. I tend to get games that are like 2 semi pros vs 1 pro and veteran.
1;Probably one of the few loot box systems worth its snuff. I have and will continue to buy cosmetics for this game only to support the amazing release of this developer without pushing up the price like other half AAA games. Simple yet something I can always come back to for a few rounds when I have an awkward amount of time to burn.
1;Cars You get boost and a big turning radius (must power slide often) Rocket Engine Allows you to jump and fly with your car.Soccer Oversized ball 2 goals built into the arena (it makes a huge difference) and average sized fields.Premium hats and hats accessories.Fantastic game. Rocket Flying Car Soccer but plays more like basketball .
1;Nice update guys! Latest update is if you try to forfeit by voting and it doesnt go through and then somebody else does it and you try to vote you cant... fix that please! Otherwise fantastic game and one of the best out there! Recommend to everybody.
1;Soar gloriously through the air as you release a polychromatic trail of confetti from the tail end of your car.That's the kind of stuff you'll see while trying to score a goal in Rocket League. Rocket League is what dreams are made of.10/10 would soccer cars again.
1;Having played rocket league for a little while I can say that the game may seem simple but it offers so much. There is always room for improvement in your skills. There is always new tricks and moves the player could make. The game is like an open canvas and you are the artist. Kind of wish that rocket league items could be sold on the steam market though. Overall great game with a low price.
1;I tried a lot of online multiplayer games over the years. shoters mobas etc etc but this one is the one i can't stop playing. It even drags me away from the Witcher 3 which is the best game ever created period. That means something! GRocket League is great. No brainer! Get it!
1;So much fun! Simple quick to learn yet challenging to master. Great to play solo or with a group of friends. The game has a surprising amount of strategy and can is very balanced when two evenly matched teams play each other. Definitely one of my favorite games in the past few years. I would highly recommend.
1;This game am my favorite game and I still come back to it daily despite having nearly 2000 hours on record. Get it even if you don't think you'd like it from the way it looks/sounds. Chances are you'll have a great time.Half my steam friends are on my list just because of this.
1;This is as really fun game that i would recommend. The customization is really cool as well but of course u will have to buy keys. Use a controller it is way easier to learn the controls rather than using a keyboard. Its a fun game to play competitively or just for fun with your friends.
1;This is an amazing game. It is a teamwork based game that really makes the gap between an average to a pro obvious. It is a difficult game to master however this game is a work of art. It is something that is really enjoyable and relaxing.I recommend this game to all the people who want to play with their friends and have fun and to have a nice relaxing time.Overall I love it! &lt 3
1;I just love this game. Purchased it originally on PS4 and fell in love. 340 hours in on PS4 I decided to build a PC primarily for ROCKET LEAGUE and the experience has been that much better. It's fast pace in 5 minute spurts unless you go overtime is just the perfect pace for me.
1;Do you like an intricate complex game with deep strategy a huge upgrade system and a story like no other where your choices affect what happens within the world? Well you are looking at the wrong game in this one you play soccer with cars. It's a blast 10/10
1;DRINK F**KIN BRAAWNDOOOOO. YOU F**KIN PU**Y!!DONT YOU DARE DRINK THAT FUFU A** HATERAIDE BULLS**T. BRAWNDOS GOT ELECTROLYTES. ITS GOT WHAT YOU FU**IN CRAAAAAAVE.WANNA GET F**KED UP FAST? SNORT SOME BRAWNDO SHOVE IT UP YOUR A** F**KIN SHOOT IT UP BRAWNDDOOOSSS THE SHEIIITTTT.also this game stole a whole week of my life from me 10/10 wander why the f**k i keep coming back.
1;I like the game it is fun for both beginners and pros.Multiplayer is very good all my friends play on Xbox whereas I play on PC the cross play feature means we can play together in private matches. I like doing single player seasons offline and multiplayer competitive 1v1s online.My only problem is at the start of this new season there are too many smurfers and I am stuck in the bronze rank.
1;One of the best games I've ever played It's got depth strategy teamwork and skill. It's the kind of game that you can have fun with without a ton of skill and also has a good competitive scene (though I mute the other teams voice). Also muting people's quick communication in game is easy as well.
1;*Attempt to aerial save a chipped shot**Accidentally redirect off target shot towards goal*$# %!$# %!$# %!Nice one!Nice Shot!What a save!Still the best game ever...On a serious note I cannot recommend this game enough. It's brilliant. It doesn't matter if you don't like football or cars. It doesn't matter if you suck at car games. This is worth every penny and then some. Easy to learn but difficult to master and there's a place for all skill levels in this great community. BUY BUY BUY!
1;I think it's a great game but the only thing is that things get repetitive after you've learned how to do ariels trickshots and other complex things because you get to a level were you are just slowly getting better at small things. But I still recommend it because it's a different type of game in which you don't know the controls from the start unlike most games and when you learn things and are able to complete them its a great feeling.
1;This game is really fun I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a game ranging from casual to competitive.Psyonix is also one of the best devs around they do actually listen to their community specially on Reddit!Wow!OMG!What a save!Chat disabled for 3 seconds.
1;Shouldn't even be reading this review. This game is a must have in your library. Esports constant updates tournaments skills and crossplay with console gamers.From a thought perspective doesn't sound fun. You're playing as a car and using it to play soccer. Not very appealing. But it is so much more. It is a game of skill teamwork and a hint of luck.
1;If you want a laugh with friends rage at your friends and scream when you score in the last minute to win when you've been down 4 0 all game to comeback 5 4. Definitely recommendGreat amounts of customisation. Cheap DLC and runs smooth on low end PCS. Hard to master but that's the challenge of the game. Great competitive aspect and rewards.Who thought driving cars with rockets on and smashing a ball into a net would be so much fun? 10/10!
1;Rocket League is really simple to play casually but has a high skill cap and can get as difficult as you make it. It has a good trade/custom system and frequent updates to it's content. The ranked mode is pretty well acclamated too. Players eep finding new ways to completely change the way this game is played. It might seem like and RC Car Soccer and it can be if you want it to. But it has the skill scaling you want in a game to be fun challenging and competitive simultaneously
1;In the running for 2015 GOTY. Definitely best bang for your buck for a new title.Pros Soccer with rocket cars Runs very smooth Matchmaking works well Gameplay is extremely fun whether beginner or expert Quick matches Good community Lots of room for expansion and improvement in the futureCons If you have connection problems the game is unplayable (usually hardware problem on my end) You will run into children playing on their PS4s
1;Soccer meets driving once again in the long awaited physics based multiplayer focused sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars! Choose a variety of high flying vehicles equipped with huge rocket boosters to score amazing aerial goals and pull off incredible game changing saves!
1;Psyonix... Please fix your servers.. I've lost count of how many times I got disconnected from the match and the issue was exclusively on the server's side. The most infuriating part is getting banned because of it.The game is amazing but sometimes the servers are complete crap.
1;Coming up on 150 hours played and I can confidently say I will play much more. This game is extremely addicting especially if you like soccer and cars (like me). The other game modes featured are also very addicting which makes it easy to spend a lot of time in the game. Graphics are great music is great and it has no bugs that I have found. The best part is it is just $20 and it is $20 well spent.
1;Worth every penny if you want to waste so much time of your life on it! A few hours learning how to move properly. 200 more hours to learn how to hit a ball. 200 more hours to fly. 200 more hours to learn how to hit a ball in the right direction. 200 more hours to learn how to fly and hit the ball in the right direction. Great game for hours of addicting and frustrating game play. One. More. Game!
1;i liked the game I give it a recommendationat first you will struggle to control the ball but you will master it after doing a little bit of training. It's a competitive and enthusiastic game.generally you will be hooked to the game and spend hours and hours playing it.
1;145 hours and I am still dreadful. This is one of the few games that feels like an actual sport and it has been fascinating to see how the way the game is played has evolved over the years. I doubt there are many left who have never played it but it is hands down one of the best video games ever.
1;I used to play this game on xbox and got to top 5 players in solo duel in season 3. I love this game a lot but sadly its been dying recently and I hope I can trade my stuff over from xbox to pc when they bring out cross platform parties but I recommend this game a lot.
1;Best game i have ever played you have to spend a little money to keep your car lookin good but if you dont want to you dont have to. You can pay once and be done or if you want you could buy some keys to get a chance at winning a super cool decal for your car. overall it is an amazing game and if you are still trying to decied on getting it I would try it out
1;Honestly one of the funnest games I have ever played. 40 hours into the game and I still continue to have endless fun and never get mad. I also love the fact they its being updated with new game modes for free! I love this company. Keep doing what classic videogame companies always did and care about your consumers. You have made a great game
1;Rocket League is one my favorite games of all time no doubt. You can go and a couple matches just to have a good time or you can go play ranked and be extremely competitive.The skill ceiling is insanely high so if you want to be competitive there is a lot of room for you to improve and try to be one the best out there.
1;Pretty good with a very nice concept.Pros Good kicking gameplay Decent graphics Decent Cons Toxic Community *Half the community are scumbags that either leave you in a ranked match or say you suck af both teammates and enemy Players that leave you in a ranked match (you're guaranteed to lose unless you're better than the other team combined)Watched a game review of it and saw gameplay got me hooked by the first 10s of gameplay.
1;This action packed game will make you want more and there is always something more that you can learn. Even for people that have played for thousands of hours they are still learning and mastering new skills. The game really shines when you play with friends.
1;i hit dia 3 today and im still loving the game ever since i have switched from ps4 it keeps improving with a lot of updates and events it is a game i have spent 600 + hours if you count my ps4 hours with my pc hours and i strongly recommend this game its easy to learn but hard to master so im still trying to get to champion in 3s so close!!!
1;Rocket League is a overall great game! It has fun teamplay and is a game that is easy to learn but hard to master. The game offers the constant drive to get better and get to the next rank which is one of the reasons why this gaem is so fun. 10/10 would buy!
1;Car soccer. Car hockey.Car basketball.Use your car to hit things in to the net while collecting fuel for boost.I love this game a bit too much.It quickly took over my life as I have to play at least 1 hour per day.I mostly play Snow Day but hey.Great game.
1;Since I don't like football I thought this game must be crap.However I got it as preorder bonus with my Steam Controller and Link.So one evening I sat in front of the TV with a friend and we searched for a game we could play together on the TV screen and game it a shot.We had (and still have) an absolute blast.This game gets me from rejoice to rage and I absolutely love it.IMHO it is the best competitive game ever!
1;It's more then just chasing the ball the higher you come and the more you play with friends the more strategy you need to win. And when you finaly learn to fly you will get some AMAZING goals and saves!! One thing is missing creating TEAMS for ranked (so not everyone will have a different ranking....)
1;I cannot stop playing super fun! Matches can get intense as the timer counts down. People are complaining of it being badly optimized and server issues but I haven't had any issues at all.... Community is a mixed bag matchmaking needs work but that isn't stopping me from playing.
1;very good. takes a bit to pick up and to get to the high level starting now. But I have seen people do it. but even starting now and being in the lower ranks it can challenge you its fun its heated as some ppl in chat like to tell you. at the end of the day it is a must have in literally anyones steam library.
1;A game unlike many out there that doesn't require you to Pay to win isn't made to sell DLC takes actual skill which is derived from practice and dedication to the game. Easily the best game I've ever played am still playing to this day and will continue to play long after.
1;Product received for free. I swear to god I love the game. But the community... I just want to hang myself. Yeah there are some pretty nice people and I love that but the rest of the community the toxic vile and just disrespectful opponents you face... It's sickening. I swear those people are the reason school shootings happen and I know psyonix can't do much about it but holy damn.
1;Honestly I extremely love this game to death. Its 4 stars for me. Only reason is because it always lags on Neo Tokyo and Sandy Shores no matter what computer you have imo. And also I get demoted on Competitive after I won a few. Apparently a rocket league developer said to me through support that it takes a bit to tally in your wins in that time period but really its dumb because it gives you a greater chance to lose. I want wins when I win not after 3 wins.
1;86 hours in and I adore this game as much as when I first got it from Humble Monthly. I'm still generally at aerials and for whatever reason I'm too aggressive to be of any worth on defense )The ranking system I feel is wonderful compared to say LoL's elo of self loathing. It's also great that our benevolent overlords Psyonix shifted the ranking curve so I can juuust breach Challenger on Standard D CARRY ME SENPAI! Nice Shot! What a Play! Calculated!
1;What I'm trying to figure out is. Why isn't K.I.T from Knight Rider not on here? That's kinda a insult. Oh the game is good though. Deep learning curve been playing for almost 300 hours Gold I this season so far but the game is fun and fustrating at the same time.
1;Honestly just put in an actual working mic system if the game is gonna be this toxic. At least let me talk to the ppl who come on the game to be a troll or dont care about rank. But if i say ggez i get 24 hour ban....great game lot of hours terrible community. 3 out of 5
1;Yea... this game is like a drug. That first experience! OH THAT FIRST EXPERICENCE!!! SOOOOOO AMAZING!!! Then it is never that good again. Still good still awesome still ROCKET LEAGUE! but never never never as glorius as that first time (8hours straight for me).
1;I have not had so much fun in a game in a LONG time. I am usually not a competetive player but this game has me up against my monitor screaming along with my friends haha. Beautiful graphics. Great sound design. Easy to pick up challenging to master. Got this free for pre ordering the Steam Link and would have gladly paid good money for it. What a blast.
1;U will never regret buying this game believe me....the ball flying in the air time has finished the ball needs to die for the oppsosing team to win u hit a boomer and it goes over to ur team he is able to score u have equalizded!! it never ends every match is different from the pervious one. Updates and cates are dropping frequently.
1;Best value game I've played maybe ever. It's super frustrating. It's exciting. You feel like King Roni when you score. I love and hate this game. The casual modes are relaxing and fun. The competitive matches are intense. Would buy again. Probably worth way more than it's price point.
1;"""The Curse of Rocket League BE CAREFUL If you buy this Game you will be forced by the curse to buy every single dlc.You might say now """"But i do not need them""""The truth is it does not matter!You just have to buy it )All in all 11/10And now try it out yourself!"""
1;An addictive game that leaves you completely in awe and also equally frustrated. Can be played casually or competitively giving you a chance to just play for fun or challenge yourself to climb the rankings as you progress your skill level within the game.One warning would be that there's a lot of toxic people who play this game so expect to come across them a lot.
1;Easy to get into easy controls easy to play hard to stop! Simply the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game in recent times by far.It's easy to dismiss this game because on the face of it it's such a simple idea. It's soooo addictive especially when played with friends with voice chat.The first time you score a goal in multiplayer you'll be hooked.
1;Rocket MUTHA FREAKIN' League!This game is so much fun not only for me but for everyone in the house!It's competative but at the same time pretty much anyone with basic coordination can pick up a controller and play.If youre looking for a fun game with quick matches this is definately a winner.10/10
1;1. ball deflected and looping over enemy's half2. press jump button and boost in air3. press camera button to line up the shot4. ???5. &lt insert name&gt SCORED ! PROFIT !Hands down a very enjoyable game.Won't recommend this game thoughIt's a definite must BUY now and play.
1;I like the rocket league experience except the toxic ban because it doesn't really make the person or user stop being toxic so u should be more active on what u guys do and plz try adding more events for decrypted because some people can't afford let's and make drops more convenient. Thx psyonix love yah games.
