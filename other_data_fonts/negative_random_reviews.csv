0;Amount of bugs and glitches from error during launching to killers who consists of parts of other killers.11 invisible Hillbily with head of Micheal Myers/10 Nurses with head of Dwight and with Edward Scissorhands handsP.S.Dont believe?check out my screenshots
0;i would not recommend this.. this game used to be fun but they have fed and pandered so much to the survivors that it went from stealth and teammwork to... crouch in fron t of the a hook so the killer cant hook u got caught dont worry u have a garauntee get off his back got un hooked dont worry again when ur unhooked u cant be downed again... and if u wanna keep up with these rediculous changes you have to pay money to get a better killer..
0;Terrible game can't find lobbies more of a bug than a game no point in playing as a killer because survivors are overpowered and the servers are utter trash i usually have to play with around 200 ms which is not good compared to other games i get around 25ms in.
0;Terrible game! When you exit the game there is a chance of simply just losing rank! Community games are a nightmare! Russian players as usual will start to insult you in the chat Russian words some players start to squat once dumped a pallet! Just a disgusting game... That why i hate this game
0;I have played this game a ton. The concept is fun enough but there are some big outstanding issues. Trying to find a match is a nightmare. We've waited more than 20 minutes before giving up. If this was an early access title most of the problems could be forgiven. But it isn't. Friday the 13th The Game and Last Year is just a few months away and look a bit more promising.While I have definitely got my money's worth but until some of the big bugs are fixed I would recommend buying this on sale.
0;This game was fun until the Devs decided to nerf survivors over and over along with buffing a Killer that was already overpowered. Unless you can play with friends then this game is definitely not for you. What was a fun game has turned into a broken bug riddled and biased game that will eventually die good riddance. If I could get my money back I would and I never complain about games or write reviews.
0;"""Had a ton of fun with this game for awhile until they released Freddy. Freddy isnt only game shatteringly broken he completely drains all the fun out of the game absolutely refuse to play any survivor until they actually do something about Freddy. Instead of pretending the slight tweaks they did as a """"nerf"""". After weeks they still refuse to fix him. Would NOT recommend in it's current state."""
0;Loved the game at first one that I was really excited about but with newer updates it seems to just break the game. Literally wait 20 minutes just to play a game and then to be kicked out because there is a cheater detected or wait 20 minutes just for the game to crash. As I am writing this I am waiting 20 minutes just to get into a game please stop with the updates. As of right now I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone until the main issue of actually getting to play the game is fixed.
0;Dodgey and crap security is terrible loads of campers i report but dont get banned. That includes swearing farming and other abuses load of those idiotic people do. My word to anyone who wants to buy this garbage it is a waste of money. The devs should lower the price and highten the security because i have loads of people abusing me so i report them but dont get banned. The flippin vids aren't even game footage. (
0;Unbalanced game a lot of bugs the networking and matchmaking does not work you get kicked for no reason it freezes you disconnect the game just goes on when you close it. Overall it might be fun with friends if you get it on sale but that s about it. It also lacks broader gameplay as it s basically always the same procedure.
0;For few first games its fun till you start to notice everyone has all the most powerful perks.It doesnt even matter whether how skillful or not you are. Because you will get defeaten (survivor or killer) because you just cant do anything to assist teammates or to finish any players off.That said add a gamemode where perks are completely removed or just remove and remake at least 80% of the perks.Also looping is t bloodlust doesnt work game is unfair.
0;THIS IS NOT A REAL RELEASE BUT MORE LIKE AN ALPHA VERSION!If you wanna buy some alpha and to become a beta tester you are welcome. Otherwise stay away from this game. It crashes lags throws you out of lobby out of game etc. You lose your inventory items your points. It's simply completely unplayable.I REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PIECE OF GAME!
0;1. Killer who camps you2. It take 10 15 min to find a match because so many times people disconnect without a reason.3. So many who disconnect and you can't repair 5 generators in 2 people or alone.4. So many bugs but the developers can do DLC for 7$ because is a P2W because they don't make something good they just make killers and survivors to make money.5. I will regret all my life because I pay 20$ for this
0;This game is more like an alpha than a complete game. I've spent more time trying to get into games than actually playing. Even when I do finally find a lobby the killer just dodges without any penalty. But don't worry they brought out new outfits for the survivors! That shoudl help you get in a game with your BRAND NEW OUTFIT! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
0;Fun game does have a lot of strange bugs and cheaters but if you play with friends it's ok.They made it so easy for people to cheat on this game and the devs aren't doing anything to stop that except user reports and you have to record them doing it for it to even be taken seriously. Easy anti cheat is the biggest joke I ever heard. If they started to try to ban cheaters i'd recommend buying this game.
0;So what can I say about this game? The concept of the game is nice but implementation is poor. After releasing cosmetic DLC and the recent michael myers update the game still lacks dedicated servers. As for the balance of the current patch the trapper is incredibly frustrating to play against. The keybind to unhook and disarm are both on M1 leading to a scenario where you think you are disarming the trap and ending up getting stuck in the trap.
0;Good concept. I hope good developers actually take this concept and make a game. These guys have so many bugs. Took them 2 months to get it to where you could play with friends and another 2 before it actually worked. Then they released money grabs of clothing and an over powered killer.
0;dear god.......the queues for this game are absolutely horendous....this is no exaggeration.....i'll try to play as a killer and sit waiting for a group for over 5 minutes........ if i want to play as a survivor though i get a group in 3......... the queue times really need worked on or the player base expanded right now because the queues are so long its not even worth playing.
0;What happend Dead by daylight ?.This game is not fun anymore because of the BALANCED.Since Michael myers added in this game he is so op.This game supposed to be fun.For those of you cant handle angry issues DONT BUT THIS GAME.lot of campers.They just gonna hook you and wait until you DIE.I will not recommed this game until the game balanced again.I hope we can report camper in the furture.
0;The dev team have ruined this game. They keep pander to the killers way to much and the balance is heavily in the killers favour.Offically giving up this game and refuse to even stream this game anymore as its not something worth recommending.I would recommend against buying this game heavily.
0;Don't buy this game for killer the devs pretend to be listening but just do whatever they want. The public test build was for 3 days and didnt listen to any feedback. The favoritism for survivor is simply disgusting. They still never fixed SWF but hey at least u dont got to ready anymore. I wouldn't begin to know how many hours were spent searching for a game just for it to crash but hey at least you dont have to hit ready anymore ) . This is the makings of evolve stage 3 boys
0;"""Scooby Doo Simulator?Great game if ur planning on playing as a survivor.Game is supposed to be an assymetrical 4v1 where 1 is stronger than 4 but this isn't the case. If u play as a killer prepare to be mocked looped insulted in postgame chat by """"survive with friends"""". Killers are underpowered and some survivor perks are complety t. This game isn't an horror game at all I would say this game feels more like a scooby doo chapter than and horror movie."""
0;Unplayable laggy Since there is no dedicated servers this game not worth buying. As survivor you can wait for like 3 minutes for a lobby just to have a red/high yellow ping that makes the match unfair and unenjoyable and at the time you find and optimal lobby the killer most like dodges it for some reason because that's what happens (maybe they scared of fair non laggy matchup lol). Even on a sale you better to skip this videogame till they fix the BS.
0;The game it s self is nice but it is recommended 4gb graphics card is wrong. I went to my friends house he has a 1050ti (4gb) he can t even run this game on 60 FPS at lowest settings. I would only recommend this game if you have a good gpu. (Like me ) ) but the main issue is making this game unplayable for new survivors and making people like my friends rage quit. with the new killer (the clown) you haave no chance and over all they are making playing survivor almost unplayable
0;Just one thiing. if you dont enjoy the facecamp and be camp by any killer and trying to play fair. This its not your game. The Killer are the main thing for the devs and survivor one word. you are up!! Still its nice to get some laughs and feel like you still a newb in random gameplay.
0;This game is a piece of lagging and unbalanced game I don't recommend buying it because 90% lagging (to the point where it's literally unplayable because of the killer) matchmaking (rank 20's with rank 1's or matching you with someone from Korea when you live in Central Europe the classic ) )
0;The game needs a lot of doing up in my opinion. I find the game fun to play with friends but there are a lot of unfair parts to the game. The camping is unreal in it and ruins all the fun. Laggy as hell too. They need to improve the game instead of releasing DLCs. I recommend that if you get it wait until it is on sale.
0;"""If you want to create your own lobby as killer it's going to take 2 hours to get survivors if you want to play survivor get ready to be prompted with the error of """"Unable to reach game host"""". Haven't been able to play this game in months thanks devs )"""
0;amazing game! BUT...... for a game that is heavily advertised as a co op you dont have a good lobby system so friends can play together with other people? makes it very frustrating watching people come into lobbies then leave then come back in then leave over and over or when trying to find friends in a random lobby...... just wow.
0;"""Dead by Daylight aka Dead by T.w.a.t.s is a r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d game made by potato brains. It's full of kids and incompetent devs that instead of fixing their """"made by paint.exe"""" game bugs they ban you for them. There is an ocean of bugs like texture ones map bugs design bugs and a long etc.... but nah it's better to let the players """"swim"""" in those and instead of fixing them the devs penetrate their dirty d.i.c.k.s in your a.s.s."""
0;I ve played this game since it was released and I ve really like it but after a while I figured out that the producer are too much on the survivor side. Survivors are overpowered anyways and after that they buffed the killers then the survivors started crying and boom survivors are getting buffed.I am not playing this game anymore because I want to enjoy both sides killer and survivors.
0;Dead by Daylight used to be a great game I loved playing it at first.But since you can't find killer games nowadays the game is aids you get lucky if you find 4 survivors in an hour.I do not recommend buying this game the matchmaking is and they haven't fixed it in forever.
0;new chapter is great I also love the new mechanics involving hatch. though the aurel cells or whatever are ridiculous. would have to pay $5 just to buy a pair of cosmetic shorts for a character...this game seems like it is going more towards micro transactions. Will probably start playing soon since features like that completely ruin games for me. At least prior to this you could buy cosmetic sets and get many outfits for the same price I'd have to spend to get a pair of shorts.
0;I want to give this game a good review even tho I love this games concept but the community plays a big part of this games downfall. I only say that be'cause there is alot of people that are only face camping and it's only not fair but not fun the developers or however still don't have a balance system the killers have way more better perks than the survivors.Basically wait until the game goes on sale!!!
0;If U want the game to have a well balanced environment I hope ur group to think more about the feelings of new players. Such a simple and rough changes whether there's a transposition thinking about the feelings of a different player? and have U ever thought that every change would make an irreparable impact and loss on the whole and the part of the game?
0;"""This game was fun back in 2016. In 2017 the devs make poor decisions. In 2019 it turned into a flat out meme """"Hey guys lets just go ban people for no reason!"""". And by 2020 no fan base at all. ywEdit Literally reset my whole account and took away my dlc and skins great game 11/10"""
0;Do NOT purchase this game. BHVR delivers ZERO customer service. I bought the game and LOVED it for the three hours I was able to play it before an error with their anti cheat kicked me out of the game every time I launched it.Numerous threads e mails everything later and no response. Forum thread about multiple people suffering from the issue BHVR doesn't care. No customer support at all. The game is great fun but the company is junk. Spend your money on a better developer.
0;Spent nearly 250 hours getting my killers and survivors levels up All wasted because you can loose your savefile anytime and they are not able to recover it.Also this game is out of beta and still has countless bugs including game breaking ones.Don't recommend
0;The developers don't fix anything. When they do it takes them forever. They have even acknowledged in the past that they KNEW certain problems existed they just hoped no one would find them because it was hard to do.These devs want your money and that's it. Do yourself a favor just get Friday the 13th. Those devs actually care and you can even talk to them on their discord. Shocker I know! A dev team that listens to their fans actually draws a loyal fanbase.
0;"""Peer to peer connection in 2018 (so those greedy madafakers dont have to pay for servers). Grindfest of bloodpoints (to unlock meta perks that are also locked behind paywall and are a must if you want to actually get anywhere near to a reasonable rank). Bugs and crashes everywhere. Full of salty teen monkeys. Developers absolutely incompetent when it comes to balancing their steaming pile of shet that they call a game.""""Do you recommend this game?"""" Holy no no I dont."""
0;Would not recommend for new players playing killers is mindlessly easy and boring while playing survivor is not winnable. The DEVS will do everything in their power to make killers stronger and nerf survivors to the point of being unplayable. DEVS are actively sabotaging their own game not sure why but that's the way it goes.
0;Im changing my review since they have updated the killers. I still wouldn't recommend this game because I personally dislike the direction that this game is heading towards. There is so much dlc to this game that it starts to feel a bit like payday 2 in a way. It was a shame that payday 2 released so much dlc that it went double the price of what it was just by dlcs alone.
0;Fun but very buggy. All the bugs disconnections and frozen menu screens really take you out of the game. Not what I expect when I pay for a game... If it doesn't do what it's supposed to then it shouldn't be released. Please fix the broken game that we all payed for. Thanks!Update 1 year later... Can't even play the game... always crashes with no fixes available... thanks alot for the wasted money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!
0;A great game to play with friends unbelievably funny. That being said the game's netcode is completely ed and the matchmaking and gameplay is very unbalanced. DBDL also lacks a party system so playing online with your friends in a non private match isn't possible as of right now. This game needs a lot of work before it's worth any sort of money but the Devs seem dedicated and hopefully soon the game will be in playable shape.
0;This is a game for solo player. Can't even play with 4 friends. It takes like forever to find a lobby with 3 or 4 people. And now it contains tons of bugs that ruins the fun of the game. It should be called DEAD BY GLITCHES AND BUGS.p.s. now I can't even find a in lobby in solo survivor mode.
0;Awful game still full of bugs... Got to the end of the round and i froze right infront of the open gate and my character froze. I couldnt move and as the moster put me on the hook and i died but it kept me in the game. I had to leave the match and got none of the points i got for turning on mnost of the generators and opening up a gate. These guys arent fixing these horrific bugs SO DONT BUY WASTE OF $20.
0;A few updates ago the game completely messed up survive with friends to find a match. YOU CANT FIND A GAME WITH A FRIEND WITHIN 12 MINUTES OF SEARCHING.And also some games it disconnects survivors from the match saying the host disconnected but the host really didn't.
0;At this moment since I play this game for 3 4 week Seriously they needs to be fixed before it's enjoyable. Can't join lobbies half the time people trying to play with friends jump lobbies constantly. Game crashes at inoppurtune times anyway this game have alot of comfortable unique skill (perk) that would be make people enjoy in the gameAt last this game have a few bugs that they needs to fix it.
0;Play this game with four friends if you want to play lobby simulator. We never find a game with for people. We either have to be in a twos or a threes. This is a great game and fantastic concept behind it. However when you can't play with three of your other friends it's irritating. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Not until they finally do something about it.
0;I would love to give this game a great review but This game has crashed on my system 7 times while im in the middle of a great match. I'm running an i7 5820k and gtx 980Ti so I know system specs are not an issue. PLEASE FIX THIS game devs. You have a great title on your hands but this is a very bad problem.
0;Product received for free. WTF is goingon my game account just you got BUG by hacker and im pray of this ing poor security I just open the game and say hello push ok agreement THEN MY ACCOUNT IS RESTORE TO LV.1 WHAT HE F UCK I HAVE DONE ON THIS GAME ABOUT 150 HRS IS LOSE I GOT TO RESTART WITH LEVEL1 HOW SHOULD I DO CAN I SUE THIS LOSE I HOPE YOU REPLY ME OR GIVE ME THE ANSWER WHY THIS HAPPENNED IF NOT MY LOSE ITS WILL ACTAULLY IMPACT YOUR RATING GAME ON SOCIAL
0;listen this is a great game so fun i really well reccomed it but the only problem is it crashes all the time for me and its always mid game so i would definetily make sure ur computer is very well beacuse if not u can taek the risk i took and lag and crash
0;If you like sitting in a lobby more then playing the game then buy it. Match making is still broken... Adding new content to a game is all well and good but first make sure the basic features actually work. It's not a compatibility issue everyone is affected. Finding a match is a random game of who clicks at the right time. It can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes.
0;Dont waste your money on this trash game. The creaters are stupid because they removed infinites and nerfed survivors. But the funny part is they still have not removed iron grasp or nerfed it and they still have not nerfed the killer so this game should be better because the killer is to overpowered
0;It is a very bad game because the killer have too much power.The developers didn t do something about it but they put new clothes for them.The servers are very bad because i enter with killer who have rank 1 and level 46 and i have lvl 31 and rank 20.This game is not accurate and i hate it.
0;While the game has improved over the years.It has taken a turn down recently.As a killer it takes between 20 30 minutes to get a game together.A new DLC with game breaking machanics is released every few months.The 2018 Haloween event is nothing but more of a cash grab.the developers have taken the EA / Activision business model of screwing its gamers over and over by forcing them to keep buying the latest DLC or be left behind.This is how good games fail due to greed.
0;This game has so much potential but it feels like an unfinished game. Its riddled with bugs connectivity issues and people. If you are thinking of purchasing the game I suggest you wait. The developers need to address the weird balancing issues the lack of a party system the strange survivor/killer rank system and the lack of consequences for people who DC early to avoid giving the killer points. Give this game a few months before you buy it unless you have 4 or 5 friends you can play with.
0;it just a rubish when zhe last patch come out. The survivor cant be safe when they are seen by hunter.The widen terrain can beat all of the survivors with less wood and window.And the hunters also can use cheater(waller) kill all the survivors so easy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Gameplay ok except for window vault abusement. Balance is fine. Little to no settings tho no keybind menu.Lobbies are bugged game freezes randomly in menu for 10 40 seconds. No party system despite promises.Played 32 hours of beta had tons of fun thought the 1.0 version will be a finished product it is still feeling like beta.Don't buy... yet.
0;Do NOT I repeat NOT buy this game until you see in the news feed that the devs have fixed the progress rest bug. Its absolutly unexcusable how they let that slip and focus on 'adding more content'. DayZ made VERY similar mistakes and that is now just a cash cow game that the devs just flat out ignore the real issues. This game seems to be no different. PS Dog community.
0;Good game. really fun. Except when you get in a game where its laggy as hell and u just jump around while running. You get stuck on walls when you tried to turn and end up dying..... fix that and there will be a better review have a way to vote out for the lag on the game... so stupid i lost ranks cus of that
0;Great game but Freddy is impossible to beat. I advise that either he lose the ability to see you outside his terror radius or that he have to be within 5 metres for 10 seconds to drag you into the dream world and be only as fast as the survivors. If this isn t done I will not play online anymore and will advise against the purchase of this game
0;The devs are just ruining this game they dont understand their own game and the balance is way off and they keep pushing it in the wrong direction. They dont listen to the community dont fix important this but rather give us more needles shi*. And also the recent BAN wagon jesuschrist banning people for no reason at all and letting the hacking youtubers keep playing what are they doing.
0;The game still has the issues it has had for the past 6 months. The developers are clearly cash grabbing with cosmetic DLC and they don't care for the games longevity. Only buy this game if you like giving money to developers who refuse to start dedicated servers and making the game's name relevent.
0;This game is a steaming pile of should have done more research on it before spending the money for it. The devs are a ing joke the forum is run by ing idiots and the game is so toxic you get cancer and die the moment you double click it to start the mother er...Don't buy this piece of it will only bring you pain with devs that don't give a about you and forum mods that act like children... The game is craptastic. Watch what you say on the forums as the devs will ban you for no reason.
0;Worst game of 2016+3 k bugsposts after one month(characters get stuck in middle of map ragdolls through hiding spots no keybinds Qte programmed badly random lags matchmaking broken textures not loading leveling system broken ...And instead of fixes they put in more bugged content and ignore all the broken mess they created.Devs beyond incompetent. Will never touch any of their products ever again.
0;The Devs are completely out of touch with how to balance their game. Negative review based on what was said on the stream as well as based on the nerfs they keep throwing to killers while unnecessarily buffing survivors.The game should be hard for survivors. Not comfortable. Get your heads out of your asses.
0;WHY DID YOU BAN ME IDOITS I DID NOTHING BUT LEVEL UP SO GIVE ME A BETTER REASON TO BAN ME NEXT TIME CAUSE I DID NOTHING!I LIKED THIS GAME SO DAMN MUCHTHEN YOU HAD TO BAD MY GAME!?!?!?!?IM SORRY IF I DID SOMTHING ONLY 1 BAD THING THAT I DID AND YOU BANNED ME FRICK YOU
0;dont buy this game just dont buy ur self ice cream or something. like this games idea is very nice but the codders are af and this game cares only about money i mean it has ton of bugs for example u can fall out of the map if killer leave u lose item and offering.... well thats ur choice to buy or not to buy this game but i promise u wont be any happier with this game bought
0;"""This game is not worth the bacteria growing on horse If you want a good game go to Friday the 13th unlike the fat trash that owns this piece of they care about their game. DO NOT BUY THIS OR YOU ARE ING ! Would I recommend this? Well I recommend this as much as a I recommend a reality tv """"star"""" needs to be president so NOOOOOOOOOO!"""
0;Day 1 and a lot of server bugs. Give it time to see if they fix the lobbies and dropped connections (right now getting a game going is terrible) and add in some quality of life improvements like muting the lobby music and I might change my review. Until then meh.EDIT Almost a year later. Logged in to see what has changed. Lobbies still suck. Survivors still trolling killers until they DC. Lobby music still annoying AF. Uninstalled. Guess I'll give it another year.
0;I DO NOT recommend this to anyone without a VPN. i played one game as killer and then at the end of the game this player ( http //steamcommunity.com/id/churrothief ) Docs'd me. He gave out my home address and IP. This is just a clear example of a very unsecure game. Sorry but it kinda ruined my experience with the game.
0;Wouldn't bother getting too much into this game. Its been over a year and the glitch where all your progress instantly gets wiped out is still around. Unless you do daily backups your playing Russian Roulette every time you play. Got all of my progress wiped so I'm done with this.
0;Game does not support 21 9 aspect ratios in any way! If you own a 21 9 monitor and wish to make use of it do not buy this game!That being said the game itself is quite fun and can be very satisfying. It's a real a shame that the devs refuse to put in the effort to support ultrawide aspect ratios.
0;YOUR GAME IS ING 1HRS I CAN PLAY JUST ING ONE GAME GO DOING WHY YOU DON'T ING FIX YOUR ING IDIOT SERVER ZONE WELL CAN YOU GET MY ING MONEY BACK ? YOUR GAME IS ING PIECE OF I'M SO DONE THIS ING GAME PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR? ING IDIOT ALOT OF WORDS GO FIX IT AND GIVE BACK MY ING 19.99$ ING DUMBASS
0;Too many people using lag switches camping downed players or camping hooks pay to win killers. The pig makes no sense being a human the goal of the saw movies wasn't to hunt and kill people. make it so the killers that can go invisible are easier to see they're already pay to win. If a killer camps give them some sort of penalty like 50% movement speed for 30 seconds.FIX YOUR ING BROKEN GAME THAT CRASHES EVERY ING DAY.
0;Ranked games are unplayable people keep ragequitting without being punished. MM is broken. Peer to peer connection so if the host is downloading porn you basically can't play. With all the money they got from selling this game they should do more then something about these problems i'm disappointed.You can have a lot of fun with friends that's the only way you can enjoy the game.Looks like this game is still in beta but the major problem is the community totally sucks.
0;this is a so much cancer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and i have tumors that i can feel on my back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!they are not creators of good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i uninstall this because 1.the killer is ing invisibile 2.the event is bugged!!!!!!!!!this is not okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it doesn t deserve twenty euros!
0;Best Lobby Simulator 2017 !Just try to join with any of your friends and enjoy the 30 minutes delay before having a 50% chance to join a game !Now features 5 minutes of additional waiting on any lobby !For the devs Please enhance the match finder it's definitely ruining everyone's experience on the game. The more people quit this game the harder it is to find games...
0;Every game I have played has been a farm fest where killer never leaves hook sight. Anyone who comes to save me or anyone else is ignored and the injured person is Immediately put into a dying state and returned to the hook until they are eliminated from the game. Rinse and repeat very sad for a game I loved in the beginning and is now just stale. I don't know how is it for higher level play but I can't sit throught the hook camping and farming. Hope one day it is better &lt 3.
0;"""Just a short review because 80% already know it this game is really bad even after these years lobby system and ingame mechanics are just awful after every single big """"update"""" there are more bugs in this """"update"""" than ingame content itself (I am not talking about the unbalace in this game after every patch/update)The only reason why i am playing this game is just to annoy some players and be an to everyone and just have fun with friends."""
0;many glitch the first game i got stuck inside a hook the killer can't get me but i cant move too so the killer leftafter the shape update every killer become shape and still many bug i keep crashing this time i got stuck on the killer's arm i cant move but the killer cant get me too so the killer left.......again this game 10/10
0;It was a pretty neat game until they brought out leather face. He just mowed down three people at once. If that is not OP I don't know what is. There is no evading him. There are also videos on youtube of Leather Face just chainsawing 4 people at once. Not worth the $$ anymore until they nerf it.
0;Dear creators of this game For the first time in Dead By Daylight I found a purple flashlight and escaped with it. It even displayed me holding the flashlight while I was running away in the animation. Sadly enough this item glitched probably afterwords and did not make it to my inventory. I don't know if this will reach anyone related to the game but I would truly like to receive my purple flashlight. Thanks for listening. If you did so.
0;I like the game but I crash everytime I play this game. (2017)Ok! I am really starting to like this game a lot now. I rarely crash in game and for the most part I have a nice playable experience overall. The only problem now is the Chinese players in NA servers. Its getting to the point now that i can't even connect to the game anymore.
0;Gonna change this up althrough i am not happy in any point with killers/surviours DLCs the game is getting better and i mean it community is not that bad as it was before (Still tons of campers) there is a lot too come and i'm happy they do free updates because i'm not whilling to spend another trillion like i did with PAYDAY.
0;"""Its the worst thing you can imagine since its a """"fun"""" game to play with ur friends yet in a few hours in the game you can lose everything u grind for it . Not only talking from me but lots of persons lots their data because of the game it self so i don't recommend buying this game not only for the data but for the bugs the killers are the server etc etc . for a game that have more then 1 year its pretty bad"""
0;Terrilbe game. I played survivor got rank 10 play 5 games was back and fourth. then 5 games in a row got camped then after I started tilting i took a break I played another game and took 10 minutes to find a game that was 3v1 and got cammped the whole game again. I took another break and tried one more time and play a FREAKING 1v1 !!! THAT IS THE DUMMBEST EVER! you guys could fix this game so easily man ! but you guys are lazy and dont want to fix it! that
0;I enjoy this game a lot but thats provided I am actually playing it. Queue times are extremely terrible and if your playing with friends its never gonna happen. Might be a lack of killer lobby but at this current moment. Its best not to go ahead with the purchase.
0;It's basically become a collection game on rails because the perks nullify the basic stategy and mechanics of the game. It's pretty boring once you play it for a couple days. You literally just take turns 'saving' players off of a hook until its your turn. As killer you just run around and grab the guy who just got off the hook hook them again and run to the nearest player you see. Used to be good but overpowered perks make it not worth playing.
0;"""Don't buy this game even if it goes down to 1$. Still waste of money. Killers camp and tunnel the out of you even in the high ranks. Devs are actually encouraging it. People gonna trashtalk you like """"Don't get caught if you don't wanna get camped"""" or whatever. There are killers you can't outrun. If you start playing this game don't play survivor. Since I'll be doing the same as the other untalented killers do. Catch one and face camp the out of him."""
0;If you want a laggy buggy unbalanced game.This is what you are searching for.Killer oriented waste of money will tear your nerves as you realise how ed up the devs are with each patch.Bunch of high school teens decided to make a game ed up and here you go.DO NOT i repeat DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GAME UNLESS IT IS DISCOUNTEDEdit This game never changes always favoring killers. t ''balance''. Devs do ''pretty good job''.Classic 4v1 game.
0;F*ck this i tell u! with each new killer the killers get stronger and stronger! each survivor perk is debuffed. Look at Sabotage 3 the survivors could manipulate the hooks completely but now nooo. All survivor perks are t while killer perks are op... F this game...
0;So this is a great game and all. But you really need to penalize the people who face camp hooked survivors. Like what is the point of a game that everytime someone is hooked you cant be rescued because the killer just trolls the area around you. Should make it so people who dont leave heart beat radius of a hooker survivor cant play killer for so many hours. Lack of penalizing people is what creates this toxic game you have atm.
0;SoooooI really can't recommend the game in the state it is in right now.This game was semi balanced quite a while ago after which BHVR decided to destroy said balance yet again.Now I do understand that it is really hard to balance a game like this. And I am also not saying that people cannot have fun playing it. Don't get me wrong it IS fun to play. But the more you play it the more you see the annoying changes the devs made to it.Overall atm it's just zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
0;New player experience is trash Balancing is trash (try nurse or spirit) Resetting your rank to farm newbies experiencing the trashy new player experience is trash Lag is trash (nice killer hosts game and gets to decide the latency? epic!) New skins are being added constantly nobody cares about the gameplay though Please buy half of the new killer after buying the chapter
0;losttt alll of my progress withinnn 24 hours of gaming ( if u plan to play long in this gamei dont recomend to do so cuz ullll just lostt all ur progress just like meeeplss try to fix thiss.... i've invested over 5 million bloodpoints (not easy to gather)just lostt within a blink of an eye
0;Its a cool game and i have spend lots of time on it but recently every match takes between 10 30 or even craz after the long waiting periode. They said it would be fixed but nothing happens.When u spend money on something you want it to work and this game doesnt (
0;At this stage I cannot recommend this game.DEVs are moving extremely slow. Either they are one of the following incompetent lazy or just not caring. It's been a year now since the release and they did almost nothing except empty promises.So many bugs still not fixed...
0;Product received for free. It really is a great game. The gameplay is fun as both killer and survivor but the community is terrible. I don't think I can play as killer anymore because of the tea bagging flashlight clicking and all the other forms of mockery I have to endure just to have some fun. It is the worst gaming community I have come into contact with so far.
0;Game sucks community is devs are dumb s who throw out cosmetics to make people stick around to play their unbalanced unfun game killers try super hard and play super toxic and survivors only play 2x 4x swf from ranks 1 10 the community make it a point to play like boys to ruin everyones day just because their lives are and good for nothing. dont waste your time or money on this tier game!
0;Cant figure out why I paid for this in the first place now. Devs refuse to properly address campers and infiniters without punishing everyone in the game. The game used to be so much fun then they started messing around with crap they shouldn't have. this game could be big its only popular right now because of the disapointment from friday the 13th. It'll drop down back down again in no time and then itll be too late for them to save this game.
0;I would gladly suggest this game to anyone who enjoys wanting to rip their own eyes out through their ing if you're ready to rage more than a feminist that got told that a guys name is humongous than please download this game. Killers will find anyway to complain about how survivors are op and survivors will find anyway to complain about flashlights being nerfed. Ladies and gentlemen welcome to dead by MY LIFE light
0;Got this on sale for about $10 as a buddy recommended it. The game was fun for a bit but It feels unfinished. Very buggy. Games often fail to connect or the game just freezes. Community is also a little toxic at times...though the bugginess is far worse. Avoid.
0;"""GARBAGE. TRASH. POORLY CODED GAME. CRASHS AS MUCH AS IT RUNS. DEV'S PUSH OUT NEW DLC (PAY TO WIN) KILLERS BEFORE BALLANCE OLD ONES IN AN ATTEMPT TO MILK THE """"USEFUL IDIOTS"""" OF THER $$$.YOU ARE BETTER OFF HUFFING PAINT THAN PLAYING THIS PIECE OF TRASH.IT MAY HAVE BEEN A NICE IDEA BUT IT IS FAILED GARBAGE AND THE ONLY PEOPLE CALLING IT GOOD ARE JUST TRYING TO JUSTIFY THEIR TIME AND $$$ SPENT ON IT."""
0;I would recommend this game but I can't at this current time. Fun game honestly but the game errors and glitches are as frequent as a free to play game and thats not okay. I play a couple of free multiplayer games and some have better servers than this one. It's a bit disappointing? Game creators need to fix their servers and patches otherwise people will be turned off.
0;I loved this game when I first tried it. It has turned into a horrible toxic environment that favors the killer every time. I have truely loved playing this game but until something changes with the abilities of the killers I just don't think it is something I will enjoy playing.
0;Product received for free. This is the stupidest ing game I've ever played in my life. The matchmaking system is wack and the hitboxes on everything are broken. Good survivors against noob killers and good killers against noob survivors. How does that make ANY ing sense? Don't buy this game.
0;Most of my hours are idled I haven't ever really played this game. So I'm doing the tutorial today playing as killer on the third or fourth tutorial bug where I'm stuck in a tree and can't move. Can't restart keyboard working fine I have to exit the tutorial now I must start from the beginning yeah bye uninstalled.Also there are barely any graphical options and the stupid game is capped at 60fps? I have a 144hz screen that's useless to me. Why the hell is this stupid game so popular?
0;It's a crying shame that the devs of this game can't stand up to the survivor community turning what could be one of the greatist game of its kind into well....this. The devs let exploits run while just to appease the survivor community. So if you are looking for a balanced game look elsewhere.
0;Good game but the new Freddy DLC ruins it for both sides killer and survivor. Killers dont want to be in an infinite pallet loop and survivors want a chance to escape a killer. But with freddy you have neither The only thing a survivor can do is Pallet loop and by the odd chance you actually lose the guy when he moves away and you're outside his terror radius he once again knows exactly where you are
0;new patch Freddy DLC was RUIN the game already you destroyed the system of game with it ing Freddy is too cheat killer with any skills like block the gate windwalk all the time his body is like the wind that can walk though including drag survivor to the dream. oh damn what are you thinking? made the cheating Killer like that!?!?What happen if everybody play it.....baammm on one play it anymore....
0;This is my favorite game but they keep screwing over survivors. It seems like every update the survivors get fewer points and the killers get more. Most games the killer has at least 2 3x the points. I don't understand it. The devs need more survivors than killers but they treat the survivors like crap.Points are free devs... let us have some.
0;An alright game at first. the odd bit of fear every now and then. Very boring after though. it's the same thing over and over. repair a gen simulator would be a better fitting name. There are much better games out there with similar concepts such as White Noise 2 and Friday the 13th. If you are thinking of buying this and putting lots of hours into it... don't. The games i mentioned earlier are much better picks.
0;This game used to be good and i put money into it...now it sucks with the s you get to play with....game itself is great it only takes few people to totally ruin it for the players being killers or survivors on there own.. in the end LOSERS cant look after themselves they need someone else for backup..Games good to many tools playing it.
0;ok please fix this game like really. i enjoy playing this but since you added this new matchmatching system i cant join with friends or alone so if you want this game to sit in a lobby and never find a game! this is for you!!!! but it is a good game overall when you dont go from having young balls to old dusty balls waiting on a game
0;Used to love to play this game with my friends but now?What you're gonna see now mostly is either killers camping the hooks ALL the time or survivors flashlighting you to death as a killer.What makes it worse all of those are approved by the developer and not a bannable offense.If you want to experience what I just wrote buy this game.Otherwise spend that money on something more fun.
0;Ranking system is buggy I am facing an issue where everytime I escape using the hatch i derank first of all ranking up is a ing pain in this game and now this is totally ruining the game for me . I will give it a thumbs up once the devs fix this bug .
0;When i first bought this game one year ago it was a fun game where you actually had to figure out if the killer has any totems now its only based on farming points creating more killers not fixing bugs and overall not teambased anymore as it was. Since it tells you everything why doesnt it tell you who the killer is too when you start the game??
0;Still so many bugs and disconnection errors. I don't understand what the developers are doing. They are supposed to fix them first and then make more contents. However they just try to get more players with this poor game. If you consider about buying this game don't do that and go to play Overwatch.
0;UPDATE Thanks to the new killer this game is absolutely impossible to play as survivor. If things were bad before now they are appalling. I'm leaving this game to die.In a few words Camper killers make this game awful to play.And the saddest part is that the developers could fix by discouraging camping but they don't seem to care.
0;right now this game is broken not even mechanic wise just game wise the updates always break the game so u have to reinstall easy anticheat and what not and verify files unless they actually patch this crap i wouldnt reccomend it right now feels like the devs just gave up on fixing the bugs
0;A lot of bugs i do not recommend buying it cause the developers make it worse and worse by every update. I tought to myself i will ignore the bugs and stuff but this game is WAYYYYY more terrible by every update comming . If you consider playing it with a mate be ready to wait for 3 years .
0;The game can be fun but the Devs need to do something about Killers facecamping survivors when they are on the hook. There needs to be some sort of penalty for that just. If a survivor hides all game crows caw and circle. A killer can camp a hooked survivor the entire time and have no penalty whatsoever. Overall good game but definitely needs some tweeks.
0;One step forward and two steps back. Game was working great for a while now it seems like I cannot join a game without one or two people disconnecting. I've been kicked from a few games myself before the match starts. Needs work on connection stability or at a minimum if someone gets kicked off the game should adjust the number of generators required to escape. Come on devs you're better than this.
0;Good game the developers are f*cking stupid. They give us DLCS instead of fixing game breaking bugs that cost many players such as myself to get completely reset back to level 0... ON EVER F*CKING CHARACTER. People grind countless hours on this game and the fact that you can get reset at any moment is bullsh*t. Would not recommend buying until the devs fix their sh*tty game...
0;Honestly the game is great and amazing fun to play with a group of friends.The developers don't seem to put any real effort into keeping the community in check and it's full of really toxic players and cheaters. If they finally focus on how incredibly miserable their online experience is I would recommend but not now.
0;I think the game loses much of its value when it stops being scary. At about 10 hrs of gameplay you can see the flaws come out. While there is nothing with this type of gameplay out there on the market I feel like the game is a long way from its potential. Bugs glitches salt toxic community if you like this game you're not looking at the comment section. Stay away
0;really used to love playing the game but seeing the path its gone really saddens me. still buggy as ever and all these pay to play killers are bs running hiding and juking is almost useless against some killers such as the doctor and freddy kruegar which ruins part of the game. truly disappointed in what has happened to this once enjoyable game.
0;This game is great sometimes sad when u got camped by killer ... but its not that bad as new season. On every new season experienced players play with newbies and destroy game ... Also why the l cant instal new updates like last one with 18mb l had to reinstal the game to play it Fix pls
0;This is a really big hit and miss game. It has so much potential and its almost extremely fun to play. imo there is a huge balancing issue. Its too easy to die as a survivor. Obviously its possible to win but unlikely. I've been playing this all weekend during the free to play weekend period. I would buy this game if it was actually fixed. However being that it was released back in 2016 this doesn't appear likely. (
0;The game is actually really fun!!! But you shouldn't get it until they either remove leatherface or nerf him severely. I really liked the game before. Whoever plays leatherface should probably hang themselves. Screw you game devs for making such a broken game. Finally the other killers are also lame. Such as... hag michael myers wraith (yes I know he's easy to avoid but still my 4th least killer to play against) doctor freddy boy and the pig. In fact I don't like any of the newer killers.
0;The games good but if you're trying to play in the EU region good luck with finding a game where the killer doesn't teleport around because of the high ping he has. Honestly makes the game real and almost unplayable. Wouldn't buy the game if you're going to play as a survivor. Also for what I've seen 2/3 matches has a killer that camps the hooked survivors. Hf.
0;the idea behind the game is pretty good. It is just that the wrong developers are carrying it out. this game will die pretty soon i guess. Anyway if you are like crazy rich and actually wanna pay money for this game. go ahead give it a shot. But i am pretty sure that you are gonna be pretty disapointed by the end result. just keep in mind to not play it for over 2 hours so that you can still refund it after.
0;Devs are terrible dont jump into it. Garbage servers devs do not care for survivors. It's community is dying already it's not really worth getting into when devs only care for 1 party and having a small community. The game in vanilla was amazing now its just hot garbage with all these updates.
0;wiggle speed is to slow hooks are way to close to eath other hunters are running to fast (hillbilly can do a 180 degree turn with his chainsaw) when you destroy the hooks the just come back after a few minutes jumping through windows and pulling down pallets is laggy and to slow cause the killer is gonna hit you anyway so no i do not recommend this game.
0;GIve it atleast 5 more years and maybe you wont get stuck in a tree every third game all your perks will work like they are supposed to you wont have problems with finding a game and there are much much more bugs but instead of fixing them they focus on releasing DLCs with even more bugs to make more money. Its an awesome game and i love it but sometimes the bugs just get the best of you.
0;Don't recomment to buy full prince. This game is buggy 30% of time when I join lobby I stuck on loading screen. Event Thingies become useless after event ends and wasted bloodpoints what you can't ignore or go way around them.Unbalanced matchmaking. Lazy devs are lazy.
0;This game is horribly stacked against the killers. Hopefully they improve it.To say nothing of having had all progress wiped and now having waited over a month for some sort of fix.Don't waste your money or your time until they make the killers actually scary again. Otherwise it's a pushover for the survivors.
0;It's a nice graphic and nice story game. I played it more than 100 hr. Anyway more than half of game I foundmany bugs than can made me die. For example you can't heal yourself you can't use item you have you can't cross the window. The match making is very terrify. It use more than 10 min for multiplayer to find match.
0;This game is good but still has a lot of bugs I would like fixed.1. When I have stopped healing as i get a skill check noise and i stab myself2. I have dodged around a tree and he lunged the whole way around a tree to hit me3. The way pallets work4. there should be a way for all everyone to play more sportsman like. Most of the community are toxic and it there should be a way to punish people who are toxic
0;The killers are hitting me 3 meters away from pallets or vaults. Then they stand next to me while on the hook or they leave me on the ground when I am obsession and follow me. Then when I decide to leave games like this I receive ban.. Who is destroying the kame more? Leaver or the stupid player? I think it is company itself who is destroying this game. GG GL
0;ranked system in a non skill game. all they do is nerf survivors forcing me to become a killer main. not even worth playing survivor anymore.Update Still playing this game with friends. If you have friends you'll enjoy it. If not play killer only. Make sure to the leave the lobby after killing the survivors before they can type a message to you about how of a killer you are for killing all 4 of them.
0;The more I play the more I hate this game. Theirs Game Designers are so ing bad they getting their money for nothing.Why I cant invite friend after match when I played with him? I should exit to main menu and than enter to special friends lobby (User friendly interface yea). Why I get rank when killer ragequit at start match? Why when you play as nurse you can see backface culled geometry while jumping? Are you ing serious?
0;I understand now why this game has the horror survival tag.Basically the killers are afraid of the survivors and they try to survive to not press the magical uninstall button or the definitive delete the game button in the steam support section.2/10 Would get looped again. See ya in Last Year The Nightmare a more balanced game with better community than dead by toxicity
0;game now devs ruined it. Basically noob killers have been complaining for ages to get some buffs even though it wasn't necessary since good killers like truetalent were doing perfectly fine. The devs listened and nerfed the crap out of survivors. RIP Dead by Daylight was good while it lasted.
0;The game is good IF you can get past the connection issues server lag killer being invisible sometimes and the occasional cant click on anything at all. After the November update i had nothing but problems. play 6 games 2 or 3 will have an invisible killer. the rest run fine. and yes my pc specs are more then the recomended for this game....
0;300+ hours played this game.Best MP game ever better than CS GO and other game which have much cheaters.So much good teammates and good killer who have respect for surivors.In one hand horror in other hand survival game best connection between genres.But I am banned.Cancer game with cancer players!!
0;The game is great but I have a common problem where the killer will leave and I lose my rank. If this was a rare thing it wouldn't bother me but this is very common where killer's lag out or just simply leave the game. This makes you lose your rank and gives you less bloodpoints. Please fix this.
0;"""This game is not what it's advertising itself to be. """"A feast for killers"""" my There are only four killers in this game that aren't complete clowns in high level play. If you bought this game with the hope of striking fear into the hearts of survivors you play against prepare to be disappointed. However if your goal is to genrush loop and just all over the killer's day then this game is just for you. Otherwise your time is most certainly better spent elsewhere."""
0;This game is very good and very fun but if you play against Russian killer can be very bad from my experience they are the worst they will camp you and tunnel as long as they can survivors tho will leave you and never go for save. And this game crashes a lot i mean a lot from my experinece i have over 300 games bf4 in worst days didn't crash like this one and this one is over 2 years out
0;"""Was fun at first but after some time devs decided to """"balance"""" the game. Well. Yeah. Balance. It may be hard in game like this where it is 4 vs 1 but hooks and beartraps respawning after 3 minutes is kinda... Too fast? There are perks that allow killer to haul survivors whole map... Something what would be cool is if killer had to manually repair hooks when theyre destroyed.And one more thing. Killers like The Doctor. You just walk around and survivors scream. Too OP."""
0;I got banned because two survive with friends didn't see me do a generator. I was hooked and they did 3 generators and by the time a healed myself they did the 4th one and I couldn't find the last one. When I found it I finished it and I broke the killers hex totem but they didn't see any of that so they just said report him report him. I thought this game was the best but I don't know anymore
0;Thanks for the patches really...nevermind that the camping is still not punished...nevermind that the game is crashing like and nevermind that i loose my player levels because of this ing annoying crashing....oh and finding a match takes about half an hour but yeah...the game could be fun if everything is working like 10/1 times. Thanks!!!
0;I recommend this game still I say 'No' to get some attention. Lately the developers have been pushing their luck as they motivate survivors only to gain blood points and let themself get killed. ( It would help a lot better if survivors only get their blood points if they survived the round if you ask me.254+ hours of game play and slowly coming to an end now.
0;this latest update has ruined the game. the game was for the most part balanced before but now it is exponentially harder almost impossible for survivors. dear developers if you force us to disarm traps before getting people off hooks PRIORITIZE THE TRAPS when it comes to pressing buttons... respectfully every DbD fan that use to love the game
0;Definition of pay to win.Multiple Killers that are locked behind DLC and multiple survivors locked behind DLC. Locking gameplay behind a pay wall is pay to win. Oh also the game is an unbalanced joke and has been since day 1 The idiots making this game don't deserve your money lol
0;Absolutely hate this game the game mechanics sucks the devs are stupid and WHY THE HELL IS CAMPING A TACTIC?! the killers are all to tryhards the teams are sometimes i would rather play Friday the 13th than playing this crap. If i would recommend this game atleast they can do is make the ga e FAIR enough. But sadly i'm going to give it a not recommended game. Don't waste your money on this game.
0;All the developers had to do before 1.0.4 is to fix remaining bugs. Not only some of them haven't been fixed yet but within the newest update the gameplay has been ruined and the only cool thing about the recent update is new outfit but that's it. Totally imbalanced and not worth playing anymore.In the current state I don't recommend this game to anyone. Uninstalling and rating negative.
0;Currently Killers are too over powered and there needs to be some serious balancing. It's almost just stupid how powerful killers have become (I've been playing since release) they have way too many perks and what not that make them unfair and just straight up too powerful. Currently I do not recommend but I will fully support this game if some balances happen.
0;Devs Go yourself because i have 400 hours on this game and i bought a deluxe edition so my problem is you make super op killers and i lost al my level and bloodpoints and i haved almost all survivors prestige 1 but no you we just want you to play again the game like you're a begginer somone can help me? If somone can i rlly remmend this game but i dont want to make my level again YOU!!!
0;"""Great game HOWEVER do NOT spend money on killers. You will only be able to play about 2 games as a killer as you will constantly receive a """"No network connection"""" error every single time. If you want to play survivor it will work 100%. Playing as survivor every single time gets repetitive and draws me away from the game."""
0;Whats wrong with this game...!! the matchaking is so broken..!! i am a rank 20 killer and always get me with rank 1 5 survivors..!! ffs. and when i am the survivor always it give me a rank 1 5 killer.. even if i am 15 20..!?!?! wtf fix the stupid rank system ffs..!! thats why everyone use speedhacks and wallhacks..!!! this game is so broken by itself..!!
0;Our happiness comes from the intense competitation between the killers and survivors not from hiding and repairing the machine. However it seems that the game maker doesn't know it or just neglect it. It was a good game but it is not now. That's why I write this comment here.
0;When i play as a killer.it usually shows me that 5 survivors are in the game then my game crash. what the hell is this?I sent the report bug like 10 times and it still crash after many minor patch.When do you really gonna fix this? It really me off.I have lost many pips due to this kinda of crash.
0;This game is enjoyable and fun to play in overall exccept the fact that the community is toxic and unfriendly. Addition to that this game has frequent update that took like 1000 years to finish up. It will always stopped at 100% and will take so long to finish.
0;Worse ever ! Developer keep changing !! Killer movement speed it too fast for Survivor ! Causing early game end within a minutes espeically these killer with chain saw. 20 Dollar is a jokeeeeePlayer who work hard to climb rank ! Serveer Diconnecrt Player without notice causing rank drop .
0;I do not reccomend this game. For a long period I very muh enjoyed playing this game as it conveyed a feeling of stress and dread as a survivor and of power and ferocity as the killer. However as of posting this review on december 11th 2017 I cannot reccomend this game. Survivors urrently have far to many advantages and make judiious use of extreamly heep tatics that give them a massive edge against the killer. I can't Stress this enough DO NOT BUY THIS GAME your money is better spent elsewhere
0;"""At first i liked the game a lot but recent DLC's just take away the fun. Overpowered killers and a toxic community Bugs and Hosts with always 250+ Ping make the game """"exhausting"""".9 months ago i would've upvote it.. But the way it is right now rather not.Grab it if it's in sale because i think the standard pricing for the game itself &amp DLCs is way too high. GIve it a try and make yourself a picture of it."""
0;U can change this game's name to Bug by Daylight. infinity bug in this game. if who play this game and met bug like me i sure u feel ubisoft is a angel. oh forget one thing Server is lag and i'm not a russia why alway meet only russia??? lagging every play is bad feeling.
0;This game is broken as not only can the survivor just loop around and the killer isn't able to catch them and kill them. Not only is this annoying it's ing how this is allowed the game isn't balanced between survivor and killer. If the killer could vault over the windows slightly faster I feel that the survivors wouldn't use the infinite loops as much.
0;This is probably one of my favorite games of all time it is incredibly enjoyable with freinds and playing alone can be insanly fun to. Unfortunantly I was recently wrongfully banned and the devs will not repeal it. All that time playing this game gone and the future memories I will make with friends also gone. I was very excited for the new DLC but it looks I wont be playing it. As much as I want to I can no longer recommend this game.
0;Here we are at 2.1.0 and things still haven't changed. Using bandaids to cover up apparent game flaws.Flashlight timing has gone out the window. Killers now have insane aura perks that allow them to see you. They nerfed all exhaustion perks when only one needed a nerf. These devs still don't know how to make a competitive game they just want you to see your can play as liscensed killers but only 2 are viable in the game. Pretty bad job so far.
0;Above average design but persistent bugs and a sadistic toxic community have destroyed this game. As decent players have moved on to other games the community has only continued to get worse. This stays in my library in case friends want to play with me but I will never pay another dime for content.
0;Today I didn't play Dead by Daylight but My account permanently baned about Dead by Daylight I want to know why?I never used Hacker or change game files please explain Why is permanently baned .Is it because I leaving/disconnecting from the matches before?If you play games you will know.Sometimes you have to quit a round of games killer intentionally increases game time(More time I just played survivors).Dead by Daylight Community Management team No reply to me Fxxx.
0;Product received for free. Spend nearly 20 min in lobby for waiting other survivors to start the fk game. Bring everything back plz. You really need to adjust this game again. It seems like no one will attend to play survivor. And it is really annoying to spend 20 min on waiting.
0;Game would be great if developers give right rules in game. Killers can use unsports behaviour to win which we survivors cannot counter. Campers and tunellers in game more than 70% of games were played with toxic killers. If developers still let killers play like this this game will be trash. For now i don't recommend this game to anyone.
0;If you like to spend you free time waiting to join a game then this is for you!! I just love being in a lobby for hours at a time hitting join join join. Maybe one day i'l lwin and actually join a game.In a nutshell this is infinate lobby hell and I want my money back!!!
0;&gt Not recommending this game until Freddy is dealt with Before he came into the game i would have recommended this game 100X over to anyone.&lt The game is amazing (With friends) but since Freddys joined its became as . He's so broke. *Plays Meg* *Gets hit with sleepiness**150% Speed boost**Enters dreamworld with Freddy sat next to me*
0;dumbest game youll ever play only reason i still play is because i have hopes that ill find a decent killer that doesnt camp or that doesnt play like a total . After 2 years they still havent found the balance between killers and survivors. They need to ban face campers.
0;Dont buy. Not even for little money.This game is the most toxic game every created and in addition got a highly toxic community.Avoid this game by all means !!!On top of this the devs are idiots and ruined a good game idea.The game is annoying and unsatisfying as the killer and as survivor. Good job.
0;It was good game but developer only playing killers so you know how it s end. Every single patch there are 20+ buffs to killers and they perks and 20+ nerfs to survivors. Game is not playeble atm.As killer even if you don t trying you auto win.It s end like you have teleporting killer who perma see you whole game and can one shot you. you can t even spring if you do it for 3sec you must stay on place 1 minute wtf.
0;This game gets worst and worst as the days go on... it tries to be something more than it needs to be while at the same time is completely repeative all the time same thing over and over. The killers can be op in the right hands. The survivors suck at getting of hooks and bear traps when you need it the most. It was once fun but not anymore Friday the 13th will completly kill this game and righfully so. Maybe Dead by Deadligh can learn a few things from it and make a 2nd one. Overall 6/10.
0;rank system sucks whenever i get to rank 15 or so i get to 20 pretty quickly because the killer leaves every single match!! its most likely impossible to get to rank 1 playing alone. That should count as a win tho or nothing rather nothing than a lose...
0;why in the hell I got all my stuff deleted? like it said that i cant join a lobby while i was playing with a friend i shut dbd down started it up then i saw that all my stuff was gone all my survivors were at level 1 got no blood points nothing. what in the is this?
0;"""Look the game's great. But the uncalled for part is the farming... Once you get that out of the way i'm sure you can go pretty far aka the Span of one more year from how the Devs find our response as """"Funny"""" or """"silly"""" Making the killers have 20 buffs in a row and 60 nerfs for survivor."""
0;This game is aight. I have played for 2 years and in that time i have learned that the killers are OP. Im a high ranked survivor as well so im not just saying that. Hit box sucks in this game and Devs do nothing to fix the mechanics of the game. They just keep producing crap killers that are OP and making the game really irritating. How about take some time to fix the game instead of dumb new killers? Devs lazy as .
0;After reaching Rank 5 as survivor i can say that is a fun game yes but 75% of killer are clearly CAMPING or a kind of so u will be bored to play after several hour killer are braindead and ruin the game so they can kill you faster and rankup so the game is for this. If you wanna try find it out by yourself this game broken cuz of braindead killer.
0;Unbalanced piece of Killer is more scared of survivors than they are scared of the killer. Pff survs are not scared at all.This game is pure unbalanced trash for killers.I used to love it when killer could kill not survivors decide how many kills killer gets usually 0.If you want to have a horror game experiance go play something else.If you want to bully a guy in the forest with 3 teammates go ahead.
0;Fun if you have a bunch of friends to play it with but the devs have no clue how to make a competative game and it really shows. Watch a couple videos on it and try it but don't be afraid to refund it. Also this game is a grind to get good perks. It will take you hundreds of games just to get one perk you want to use and you never know when the devs are going to nerf it to oblivion.
0;The game was good once upon a time and would have recommended it but as of now I can't recommend the game. The game is so unbalanced and the devs almost always side with the killers and buff the hell out of them and survivors always have been getting the short end of the stick.
0;The new patch is just awful. Pallets are still completely unsafe. Killers get a free hit across a pallet stun. Vaults get cancelled mid vault by doctor. Flashlight blinds are now impossible. 3 second delay after unhooking before you can start healing. On top of all that killers get lag advantage. I will not be playing this game until the devs fix these issues and I encourage all other survivors to stop playing to make the killer queues as long as possible.
0;The amount of bugs in this game is absolutely ridiculous. You would think you were playing a beta. I keep finishing games and my blood points are not added my pips are not added it doesn't rank or derank it doesn't give blood points for dailies. What the hell is the point if it doesn't work? Get it together and this is actually an amazing game. But unless you're willing to deal with the many MANY bugs don't get it until the developers put a bit more time in.
0;Don't bother playing this game. Besides the obnoxious balance issues its buggy as heck.In fact it will randomly delete your save profile and reset all your progress erasing everything you earned and unlocked. Don't bother asking for help restoring your profile either they will refuse.
0;I bought the game and couldnt find a match even as Killers or Survivors. Half an hour of waiting and the best lobby I found was me as the Killer and 2 other Survivors. I dont know why this happened. Made a refund afterward but still want to play it. Hope they will fix it in the future
0;after playing about 50 hours of this game soon as there new patch came out for halloween everything went to my lvl 1 wraith rank 17 has been paired agiant rank 15 5 that have charaters that are atleast lvl 25 with 4 super rare perks how is this fair i have 1 perk then the survivors complain if you camp them but the troll you hard if your doing bad then if your playing a survivor agianst micheal or the trapper you always lose if you dont have muiltple perks
0;This game is full of fklcing idiot camper killer and egoist survivors.But an easy way to win this sht game you need just to download as killer and the survivors get laags and leave easy win.If you find some people mid on day and not mid on night . sht game sht people with no skill and to much friends ..i..
0;So. I'm a new player to DBD And i can already say that there's tons of bugs that needs to be fixed. For example getting kicked out mid game for absolutely no reason at all. Random lagspikes and im on cable. Map tearing apart and alot of other stuff. I wouldn't recommend playing DBD Until it's finished.
0;Game? AmazingDevs? TerribleGame has a ton of bugs devs have no idea what is going on in their own game even after multiple reports devs refuse to believe that some bugs exist and refuse to fix them.Buy this game only if you are prepared to lose the match multiple times only because of bugs (you get stuck in a tree your game crashes).
0;Creators of this game are stupid es.THEY CANT IN BAN PLAYERS WHO CAMPS.WORST COMMUNITY EVER.WORST BALLANCE EVER.WORST REALIZATION.BAGS.LAGS.STUPID CAMPING S.STUPID BAN SYSTEM IT NEVER WORKS.OK YOU SAAY THAT THESE PROBLEMS ONLY ON LOW RANKS?NO!ABSOLUTELY IN NO!THESE PROBLEMS ARE ON ALL RANKS!I HAD 8TH RANK AND I KNOW.SO I DONT WANNA BEAT AROUND TE BUSH THAT IS WHY I CAN SAY FINAL VERDICT THIS GAME IS T AND THIS GAME FOR STUPID USELESS CREATURES
0;Freddy literally ruins the game and these devs are too to take away his perma invisibility and introduce something else that their game has died in almost 2 years. and keep in mind they just released freddy not long ago and have already had to nerf him yet they buffed him more than they nerfed him so you do the math.
0;2nd day after patch 2.1.0.What a disappointing version.I don't think it's a reasonable update. This Game totally not friendly to new players even thousands hours human palyers also can't live with a baby killer.Idk why keep buffing killers and nerfing survivors. Human has fellings. I don t criticize camping but Trapper with 2 red Add ons makes this game unplayable right now.(Using English cause I think developers are likely to see it.)
0;game after i left playing this game for friday the 13th for a couple of months. I can't get past the title screen without being intorrupted I contacted the costumer support team and i haven't gotten the issue resolved in 21 days. This game is a joke and a scam. I paid for this game and all its DLC's I supported these developers and their work. It's disgusting that they do stuff like this.
0;If u want to play as killer then you will have fun if u want to play as survaivor then ur fked up because the devoleper called this game a killer game not survaivor and killer gamerand 1 of the most stupid things that the developers are consider the killers are their gods if the killer leaves the game the survaivors got a decrease rank and if the survaivors leaves the game the killer increased his rank
0;this game is honestly trash never buy it. i dont know whats worse out of the community and the game they are both the abosolute worst humanity has to offer i hope anyone who plays it gets hit by a semi trailer and yes that includes me. in closing Devs and community you are ing worthless brainded scum bastard pile of trash mental that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerates you are humanity
0;"""i regret every cent i paid for this game and every single DLC. New Killer are always op as f*ck and those freaky devs have no clue what they are doing. I am not even sure if they have a Testing Department.Mimimis of killers are usually fixed soon and Survivors complainings treated like """"Hey....Challenge Time""""Please stop using hard drugs and try sth else like gardening instead of game development."""
0;It's a good game in of itself but the devs are sh*t they dont play the game to know what's bad ot good about the game. They perma ban players without telling them why even if it isn't an obvious reason (the player only used a glitch in a private lobby but still got banned.) The devs are just sh*t to be honest but if you want to give it a try its a game that's fun but the devs are just throwing it away and will kill the game and it's potential to something bigger. (Unban Noob3)
0;This game is fun when you play with 3 or 4 friends. You don't have them and you like being camped and killed 24h even with a lot of surviving skills ? Then this game is for you. Percentage of unfairplay killers 95%. Yeah I played a lot so I can make statistics this game is more toxic than League of Legend Call of duty and Minecraft. A travel to Tchernobyl without protection is safer for your health. Trust me don't buy this game and go play murder on Gmod.
0;Pretty bad there's no scariness or tension whatsoever. If you're a survivor you're going to win unless the hunter is cheating somehow and if you're the hunter you basically have to hope that the survivors don't know the mechanics. Most matches are over in 2 minutes because of how much benifit the survivors are given. Faster reactions chase breakers as well as the ability to just flat out stop the hunter from winning. Don't bother putting money towards this game let alone time.
0;Product received for free. i have 250 hours in this game so i know what i am talking about when i say dont buy it. dead by daylight had a golden age but it is now completely unplayable. the devs dont care about the game anymore every killer hook camps and no matter what you do dbd wont be fun. dont buy this game wait until the devs start caring or wait until another dbd like game comes out
0;a game full of error 300 codes unable to load errors restarts decentralization error's and no network errors on a 1gbps internet connection these developers really don't know how to bug test or code...... probably both.PC i7 8700k 32gb 2666 ddr4 2 x 1tb M.2 samsung 970pro 1080ti 4k

0;"""Product received for free. THE GAME IS GOOD BUT ING BALANCE I START THE GAME AS A KILLIVER FIRST TIME PALY AND I SEE LVL 45 PALYERS JUKING ME AROUND WTF MORE SKILLS MORE EXPERINSE THEN US GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY AND TAKE THIS GAME FROM ME WHEN U START TO MAKE IT BALANCE THEN MAYBE WE PLAY IT """" DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS TILL THEY FIX THE ING PROBLEM WITH THE BALANCE """" AND I BOUGH THE DELUEX"""
0;The game is buggier than most open world survival Early Access titles. The bugs got even worse since I recommended it six months ago.Also the killer hosts which means lots of lag for everybody. Moreover fewer and fewer people are playing each day so you have to play with opponents farther and farther away which makes the lag even worse. ORIGINAL REVIEW Despite its flaws I've never been this scared in a videogame.Play both killer and survivor.
0;So this was my favorite game where I spent 750 hours playing but lobbies got horrible and then the devs got lazy. Probably the worst developers in gaming history. They don't know how to fix a launch error that at least a fourth of the people that play this game are getting.
0;Don't buy it!Pros solid gameplay funny scary and creative killers nice graphics (in my opinion)Cons Infinite grind Pay to win (you can buy teachable perks from the shrine too with shards BUT you need to grind for the shards too) bad salty troll community (the community ruining the gameplay most of the games)
0;"""Ok game now that the grinding is less. Playing with randos sucks buy only if you can play with friends. The balance is not polished. Do mind that to play this game properly you need to grind a lot of hours to get tier 3 perks and perk """"drops"""" are random...I give thumbs down because my favorite killer is still the worst (Wraith) after years..."""
0;This game is so addictive and fun but it gets annoying when half of the playerbase wants to you up instead of working in a team. It is in some parts still buggy and when you get the hang of this game then survivors are really super nerfed and killers are playing easy mode. .New update Not a lot of things got patched killers still op players are and so on.
0;Support team of this game. Please do handle all the current bugs and unstable server issue. I have been disconnected from game serveral times in a day itself. I believe it's not my network issue as my friend is still able to cont the game in the same lobby as me. This is getting so irritating for a person to play the game. Hope to see the improvement of the game itself asap.
0;this game is you can't even find a game most of the time. it will take about an hour to get into a lobby. Then once that happens you have to deal with the plathora of bugs glitches exploits. Do the devs do anything abouit them?? no absollutely not. Do not bother with this one guys you will just regret it dearly.
0;The game is really fun to play in the first 10 hours or so since you will be screaming and laughing. However the game is full of bugs and glitches and the developers fail to promptly fix any of the issues resulting in people leaving and the game dying. The game might be worth buying when its on sale but not at full price. Even then you might encounter bugs and problems with the game.
0;Holy ing hell I love this game but I can't stand my game crashing almost every single game I play. I'd be nice to get a patch this fix this...I will change this review once patches are released to fix this problem. /Update Ahh yes an update now I get in trouble for when my game crashes now wooooo.
0;Wish I had more hours on record but it's hard when I can't even get in a damn game. Most of my hours are waiting in a lobby trying to find a game only to be booted or never connect. Luckily for me when (if) I do get in a game I get the most broken busted up piece of glitch game ever. Should have set $17 on fire and saved some time.
0;Game used to be a lot of fun with friends but over the past few months it has become a true nightmare to play. Too many bugs to count no improvements to survivors or killers whatsoever sure we're being bombarded with new characters all the time but what's the point if the game is filled with bugs and off balanced items. Game definitely needs a caring hand graphics wise not sure if it's the engine it's running or it's just lack of experienced texture artists. Game has a lot of potential.
0;"""The lastest update to DBD is a cluster of a mess it's super killer sided based from the update nerfed survivors once again for listening to the reddit community. Now I wish this game was reverted back to the old ways before all these """"balancing"""" updates came out. I'm super dissapointed with the devs. What next adding a add on that insta kills survivors?"""
0;If you are part of Oceania (New Zealand and Australia) then don't buy this game as you will have a VERY long wating times in the lobby for people to join (15 to 30 minutes at times) I just wish someone told me about this before I bought the game. 100% not worth buying for this issue alone.
0;Too many glitches and bugs the killer just sits there and stares at you on the hook so theres no chance of survival once you go down theres too much they need to fix and youll just get frustrated with the game if you haven't already frozen or gotten kicked out. Shouldn't have been released to the public yet.
0;The game itself is really great WHEN IT WORKS. When you contact support they just tell you to take the same steps that are listed in the forums and they DONT WORK. If not for the chronic issues I would recommend this highly but since you can expect disconnections delays and other issues with no support I have to give it a bad review.
0;You in' devs you are destroying the masterpiece you made... Well just like the four eyes dev said... I'll go play GTAV or PUBG or something more playable than this crap! And it hurts me to comment this but hey like I said you're making this masterpiece a total disaster.I really used to love this game but now wow... No words#DISAPOINTED#HEARTBRAKE
0;Game is fun buggy sometimes unfair a good majority of the time and has a fairly toxic community... I was alright with this game then something weird happened it uninstalled itself. I thought nothing and sat for an hour and a half for it to reinstall. Cool works fine. Unistalls again. And again. And again. I can only take this as a sign that this game is not worth it. No amount of forums troubleshooting or entire reinstallation of steam has fixed this. Meh games okay.
0;If you read the forums many players have lost their progress to some bug in the game and had our levels reset to 1 losing all our perks and items. The lack of communication be it by email or forums from the developers is non existant. Some players have even had their accounts wiped multiple times.
0;It used to be a great game that was fun and addicting. Now it's more of a chore to play because of the Devs tendancy to ignore their own community.Recently they've even taken a step further and now silence any that is critical of their product. You can still find enjoyment in this game be beware of what you're purchasing.
0;The game is very fun and has a lot of potential. With that said the number of game crashes/graphics card crashes increases every patch and for that reason I cannot recommend this game. The devs need to tackle the countless bugs and crashes the game faces before adding new content but that doesn't seem to be their priority. Very unfortunate.
0;This game is not worth the full Price. Get it only if its like 5 Bucks. Massive bug and balance issues most toxic community i ever seen (worse than lol) no dedicated servers and devs.Game is poorly optimized so it runs poorly. A lot of hacking and Exploring. Random sometimes undeserved bans and no bans for obvious cheaters. Dont recomend.
0;What is with all of the whining about this game being too hard on the survivors? This game seems to be heavily skewed for the survivors to win. Just a clue to the Dev's it's supposed to be difficult to survive a horror movie not easy. If someone can fix a generator within 30 seconds of starting the match that is a problem.
0;"""Fun and exciting at first.Then you see that there s nothing resembling """"horror"""" in this thing. It s more like a tag game.The game developers seem to think that survivors are entitled to escape so they give them so many OP perks it s insulting really. The survivors don t fear the killer. At all.They will loop t bag body block blind use their BS perks and bully him to hell and back.I would get a refund if I could.Stay away from this one."""
0;This ing game needs to pay more attention to BOARDS(PLANKS). The amout of hook is more than the ing boards besides the ing new maps are so ing that I can't even believe someone has made this out...This game has to fix so much things and think why The Fifth Identity is better than you DBD.
0;Game players are toxic as ive put almost 400 hours into this game and anytime i get in a match teamates are straight and killers facecamp like a theres no point running borrowed time as killer will still tunnel your into oblivion games not worth the money or the time
0;the game is really fun. . . . . . when you get to play it . . . . . a friend and i qued up for a game got to play one then tried for 1 hour to get another game going....if you want to play by yourself and match up with others its not as hard to get a game but if you want to try and survive with 1 or 2 friends good luck with that. i may no longer play the game because you never get into a game anyways
0;Dead by Lobby or Dead by Lag Cheats. It's not even really that it spends time for matchmaking but it's so buggy you spend 4 to 5 times just trying to get it to find a match.This game has it's moments and it is great fun. Assuming you want to wait for it.Since the Killer hosts the server you get to deal with 100's of lag cheaters...
0;it's lige the devs dont play the game them self. ive always been a surv main but recently it's been a nightmare they just keep buffing the killer. so now ive gone over to killer main and good greif it's easy.... i dont get why 50% of all the killers cry.
0;"""Excellent game. Definitely a genre changer for horror! Also add slendermanEdit Still haven't fixed buggy servers so I'm goin got change this from a """"yes"""" to """"no"""". When they fix the damn servers I'll vote up.Edit 7/28/18 The dedicated servers work pretty well now. Will update once I try """"KYF"""" mode.Edit 7/28/18 Nvm. Servers are fine. Matchmaking is horrible. Over 15 minutes for queue time with over 20000+ players online."""
0;the game looks a bit brighter. but i find myself at the beggining of the game having to alt + tab to fix the mouse issue. i find that killers kicking gens is kool but thats about it. it looks a bit better but i feel like the brightening the game makes it worse. the wait times to get a match weather it is killer or surviver is still bad. dont think anyone needs to waste time in a lobby simulator.
0;The game is unbalanced and punishes you for playing killer. Survivors have too much control over the game. The killer's ability to do well is contingent on the skill level of the survivors. Too many loops make the game unplayable. I will not play this game again until changes are made. New game rating 1/10 stars. This game is currently a toxic hell hole.
0;The question is simple do I recommend the game? No. Because the people who's making this game doesn't do sh*t about every f*cking bugs there is in this game and the servers are complete sh*t the only changes they're doing is new dlc's and thats it. The game was awesome at release but not they don't care about it anymore. PS Finding a game will take you atleast 10 minutes for 5 minutes of gameplay (if you're lucky).
0;ProsFun for a bitIt can be a great game to play with friendsConsLag/no region capCamping playersdevelopers release new content before fixing the old playing with friends is fun but matchmaking isn't working properly and hasn't been working for months so you will spend more time in the lobby versus actually playingAfter 1004 hours i rate this 5/10 would not recommend I stopped playing this game about 3 weeks ago and i don't regret it one bit
0;The game itself is a pretty decent idea but the balance right now is absolutely rank some killers cost money to play and are absolutely terrible anyways after being week one nerfed despite being subpar BEFORE the nerf. The developers would rather stick their head into the ground when constructive critisim is brought up and will even brush it off by saying you should 'play civilization' the series instead outright telling you to play a different game. Its really bad. Don't buy this game.
0;Devs are officially braindead and people like TydeTyme understand the game more than the devs themselves. This update is absolute and I'm sick of their Don't bother buying this game unless you want to be a toxic survivor main.Slowly losing faith in this game...
0;fun but has bug right now. havent played in a while now because i cant get into a match at all. if i do then the lag is so terrible that death in game is absolute. complete garbage at this point. instead of going forward they make it work for a bit then screw it up. more like a yo yoUPDATE can no longer even play the game. been an absolute waste of time and money. spent more time troubleshooting than actually playing. the devs really f! #$d this one......
0;The game is just broken half the time i join or try to join a server i get a infinite loading screen. So this is going to remain a bad review untill this bug is fixed so i dont have to close dead by daylight 50 times a day just to have a 10% chance to play a game
0;Bad review! Reason no other playing the butcher is simply too happy to play and play now can run a human can jump on the cellar is good and weaken the hunting experience with accelerated run no problem also invincible also weakened meaning that the butcher play The joy of human beings on the all dead.
0;I cannot give this game a positive review atthis time.. there is to many problems. I just recently lost all my saved data and there is no estimated time for a fix. over 300 hours lost multiple prestige suriviors and killers all gone. that and connection issues that plague this game its just to much.. its been out over a year and its not getting fixed but they have no problem pumping out DLC content NOPE NOPE ... Im out...
0;Played the game for 160 hours just to have all my stats wiped on the arival of the new season. Lost a lot of powerfull killer addons and perks. I emailed the support about this problem 4 days ago and so far it does not seem like they care. No email back and so far my stats have not been fixed. I'm glad I wasted my money on all the DLC just for them to wipe all my stats. THANKS DBD TEAM!!
0;I love this game clicking the ready button is what i love the most about this game. my more so when the killer is laggin his off but i donno the ready button really is what keeps me playing this game with my friends of corse we all enjoy the ready button )
0;Edit So after months of giving the game some time and the devs to work on their broken game... uh... here's what I noticed Now you don't need to spam the Find Lobby Button it will automatically search for a lobby for you after you select it once. And... it still doesn't work.Looks like I didn't miss anything important while I actively decided to not play the game. Cool beans.
0;Eternally buggy. If it worked 100% it would almost be a perfect game. I love this game but I cannot defend it objectively. I keep playing because they slowly fix it while breaking it along the way and I'm just hoping they fix it eventually.Edit One year later the devs keep adding DLC without fixing obvious issues like P2P hosting. The South African community as also disappeared completely forcing me to play on overseas servers so people complain about lag and flame me. fun.
0;Dont play survivor if you want to rage because if your teammates feel like being ing idiots and not helping you or grab gens its gg because the hunter finds you first because your the only one on the gen. this has happened so many times ive played survivor more because i have more fun on it when i have good teammates but that was only onve they need to make a bigger reward for saving teammates.
0;The game is sirriously broken the patches most of the time up the game even more cause the killer is getting more and more op most of the time while survivors are being nerved. not only that when you play solo you are able to play 1 and maybe if you are lucky 2 matches before your loading screen bugs and you have to restart the game...
0;I would kinda recommend this game but not really killers disconnect after 10 mins of trying find a game or they will leave mid game after using gained items so they are wasted and now to end it all my 185 hours worth of progress has been bugged and now it's dead
0;The game itself is great. But the community is complete SH&lt 3T. The community lacks empathy for the killers at all times they'll complain for just about any excuse they can find. Making the killer side not very attractive to play since your by yourself fighting against 4 people after having been trolled ingame.
0;This is a game for people who play killer if you want to be survivor good luck every patch the devs suck the of the killers so hard they survivors nerfs all over their face. If you like to play only killer this is the game for you if you don't save your money and play another game.
0;I honestly enjoy playing this game but objectively it's not a good game. The devs are clueless have no idea on how to properly balance a game and overall just don't know how to make a good game. Being toxic is the only thing that keeps this game alive. Because it keeps people coming back to get payback on each other. Without people abusing game mechanics the game is boring. And the way the devs are pushing this game it's going to get even more boring.
0;I really do love this game even after hours of playing.But today after playing one game suddenly all of my progress was gone.I wasn't doing anything against the rules and still everything is wiped away I'm really not amused.Edit I got told that I will get my bloodpoints back but I still haven't gotten anything...I'm a bit disappointed...
0;"""Good game but the awkward side is a moderators community. I saw cheaters in every 2th game with speedhacks &gt but i was banned for a """"griefing"""". Dont even think to buy this s h i t with p2w (cause cool killers cost money). If u wanna game like this better buy """"Friday the 13th""""."""
0;stop playing for maybe 2 months come back and all of the I grinded out for gone.There goes my enthusiasm to play this game anymore camping and the fact that its been months since its release but still no in game comms other than the idiotic chat board just held this game back. They would much rather release as much skins as they can to milk this game
0;In this broken state you cant play the killer anymore. Thanks to a user and youtuber named Ochid0 the survivors are using bugs and exploit the games flaws. They pallet loop juke and try everything to just the killer off. Its so unbalanced right now. I love this game but with it being so broken i just cant recommend it. Let the devs first fix the game and then buy it. I hope pallet looping and the exploits are getting people banned and or fixed.
0;This is a great game. But the matchmaking system... OMG the worst of the worst match making system. Not because of level but literally trying to find a game for 30 minutes. Start matchmaking and you will go to loading screen then you will get kicked back to the menu. Now I can't even play this game and it's just a waste of time to sit there desparatly finding a match
0;Dont buy this game. After 6 months from its release its still buggy af. Waiting to get to a match for 30 minutes just to find out that im the only survivor. Also the communitty is full of campers and rage quiters. Devs only care about their crappy dlcs . 5/10
0;"""Some Dlc killers are extremely unbalanced and giving this game a """"pay to win"""" aspect. A good example of this is """"The Nightmare on Elm Street"""" Dlc which adds the killer """"Freddy Krueger"""" to the game which is a lot better at killing the survivors than other killers like... Trapper Wraith Hillybilly and the Huntress. This game is amazing if you take away the """"pay to win"""" dlc."""
0;dont buy this game its not fun you play vs campers and if you odnt play with friends you get in a match with idiots trust me this game is not fun and if you want to play as killer you get only gen rushers so its not fun please dont waste 20 dollars buy something else.
0;t survivors sided game both end have problems and devs don't give a about the balance. Killer clowns everywhereSurvivors kings who destroy with their infinite crutch perks.This game can die already I won't play it anymore.Hope F13 or Last year will be better. t game
0;"""Since day 1 I have a bug issue that causes me to randomly be stuck """"waiting"""" when I am queued in matchmaking only as survivor. Why the is this bug not fixed? I have had to close out via task manager a great multitude of times cause you game devs are being little es. You have lost me as a future customer of your products because of this. Remain amatuers and less than even 2nd class for not being on top of the most important element of game making. Fix the bugs losers!!!"""
0;This game is not meant for killers these daysDo not buy it untill you want to get looped by survivors and throw away your PC or laptop in rageStopped playing it myself after 300+ hoursWill start it if the devs make changes to stop unnecessary toxicity because there is no skill required in what most survivors doThe game is although good for survivors
0;Product received for free. Hello to militate the creators. Your game is badly destroyed. I have a good potential but your team does not do anything about it it's amazing that you are adding new Killers but the game is balanced no . I use the game but I do not play it and I will not play it! For this reason I do not recommend the game. I hope that the native of the creator took the heart.Sorry for bad Eanglish )
0;Actually I'm playing this game for accomplish achievement progress . That's all.Dead by Daylight Spontaneous errors. They don't fix it all.There are no balance some of bad reputation ... They don't ban hackers .. (or who offended another person etc.)I think I can understand why people insult this game Behavior Digital contaminate their own game. REALLY.
0;"""I wish I could return this.It's unbalanced and correctly called a camping sim. If it was any easier for the killers they would have a big red button that appears on their screens that says """"Win game botton"""" There is little reason to play as a survivor"""
0;Game is extremely bugy and as a result of attempts to balance the power between killers and survivors the actual gameplay has been ruined and is no longer fun for either party. Might be worth it if you can get the game for $5 or less just to try it out. I will check back in to see how the game is in a few months and update my review if things have improved.
0;Pay to win killers are horribly OP the doctor is game breaking and its been several patches and they havent tweaked him at all. Apparently the developers would rather have more money rather than everyone with the base game continuing to enjoy the game with the balanced killers
0;This was an amazing game. I enjoyed playing it for hours and hours. It takes an expertly skilled group of developers to it up in such spectacular fashion but somehow the developers of Dead By Daylight managed it with ease. I hope they can fix it but I am doubtful as no matter how much they add it will consistently be unless they fix what they already have.
0;"""+ Its fun to play with friends ( full team of 4 players ) . Then is very easy to win . Bit violent (FINALLY!)

Dev created ultra killer with OP skills .uninstalled . steamsalty steamsalty"""
0;Never recommend this game. There are several reasons for this...1) You are guaranteed in every 2 3 match will come across camper2) There are a lot of bugs .. Not looking at what developers are still trying to fix bugs it turns out that they clean up 1 bug but automatically add 5 7 more bugs...3) Well of course....DOCTOR!
0;This game would be good. It has great potential. The DC's freezing (new update) toxic community and crutch and meta perks on both sides take away from what could be a great gaming experience. I neither do or don't recommend it it can be fun but issues run wild in it.
0;If you're someone that has a tendency to rage at anything that includes the following Lag Hackers Pallet looping spammers. Well frankly this game is that. I would'nt buy it unless you have friends in a private match because the online is an absolute S*** show. Also you will have more bad matches than actually winning the match so it's not really worth picking this up for online random match making play.
0;Game is completely unbalance the devs/mod r too lazy to fix that. this game gain money from addin big names killer like myers freddy leatherface.. they work very fast for banning people for stupid reason but work ages for fixing their game XD.. the irony is real with this game.. and the toxic rate is extremely high.. dont bother buying this game.. bad devs bad mod bad community.. waste of money and time believe me cause iam one of them victim for stupid banning
0;This game has potential but for now it is really crappy. Most of the time I get reallybad lags where it is impossible to run because I would keep teleporting backwards. Lots of bugs that have not been fixed for a long time. I do not recommend this game.
0;Worst game ever.This game is so unbalanced.Im not talking about the op killers but about survivors jumping over the same pallete over and over again with you to have no chance of grabbing them.Good thing i didnt buy this game on steam so i didnt support these developers.Make the game balanced or dont give paid dlcs.
0;Ok my people listen here this game can be fun but I'm gonna be the guy who says don't buy it. It's fun *to an extent*. It becomes not fun around 100ish hours then it starts to swish into very competitive. Honestly you can invest less money to a small game that's fun and growing. (Soul at Stake) But not my money just my opinion. Bien merci.
0;"""I really like this game...but there are a few things wrong with it. As a killer you can be out done by simple goofy mind numbing gimmicks like pallet running. This is where someone just runs in circles for minutes on end. It ruins any fun of the game. I'm not sure how/why the devs don't do something about this. Anyway I wouldn't buy this game until you read about updates to things like """"pallet looping"""" or """"pallet running."""""""
0;Dead By Daylight a (coop) survival horror game I've been waiting for.There are many flaws yet it's one of its kind &amp I don't know any similiar game who does it that well.I really hope the devs won't screw it up then I can see me playing this for quite a while.For now thumbs up.EDIT To be honest their dlc policy is getting out of hand. Wouldn't recommend it due to the fact all the dlc costs almost 3 times as much as the base game.
0;This is a perfect example of a dying game. The devs have ran out of ideas and now are looking to grab any money they can before the game dies. They have buffed killers to all hell and as every single survivor leaves this game it becomes harder to find a game as a killer. At this point the game will be dead by daylight.
0;"""A game where the killer can be ran around 1 wood structure with 1 wood pallet in between him while 3 people bust generators out like nothing yet its """"killer bias"""" I played survivor more than killer but now i understand this game is so survivor friendly it's"""
0;"""Game is addicting but community sucks and developers are the most incompetent i've ever seen in years. People still play with speedhacks hacked legacy and 5000 flashlights on each character and i got PERMANENTLY banned for no reason ( """"Devs"""" didn't even answer when i asked for explanations ).Don't even spend money on this"""

0;In an attempt to stop people using macros the devs have taken a nuclear approach that makes the game unplayable for some.I am no longer able to use a steam controller. my backup controller a dualshock 4 has also fallen victim of the update and the touchpad no longer works.. which means sitting near the mouse and keyboard is now a necessity.i have sunk many hours into this game but the devs are the most shortsighted lazy people i have ever come across.
0;The game used to be a lot of fun however since i got back into the game it is clear that the game is far too easy for the killers. the survivors can do almost nothing against certain killers that can down you in one hit and they also have perks that make it far to easy find you. not to mention leveling up a survier is much harder since they barely get any points as compaired to the killer. over all dont waste your time if you want to be a survior.
0;pros skill gap unique customization licensed killerscons balance toxicity people disconnecting from the game without any punishment people making new accounts to play with ranks 1 matchmaking with 150 200 ping killers getting stuck where survivors can pass freely broken perk system decisive strike still in the game broken items survivors more powerful than the killer worst way possible to report a player that is cheating
0;Laggy host. Ping is green in lobby. Game starts and it lags. Some hosts doing lag switches. People farm to cheat and get bloodpoints. Streamers that live stream for the public farm cheat and gain bloodpoints by playing around not doing legit objective gameplay. Gamers in this game are not playing the game but instead goof around. You can get reported for unsportsmanlike farming points etc. But nothing ever happens to them.
0;As of8/9/2016 it has way better game still crashes but once a day is better than every other game! Most likley from using a controller . Still lobby waiting issues but not as bad as previous updates. Match making is still uneven but they claim to be working on it! As of 1/9/2017 back to being way buggy! Infinite loading screens hard to find a lobby for a game bug exploit is ridiculous. People losing all the progress ! Save your money right now!
0;This game is baited for more and more new killer. Devs keep saying that this game is already balanced. Killer is already DEAD by daylight. ) Might be fun to play with your friends as survivor or play alone as survivor. Totally not recommend on playing killer. Play as survivor instead. idk why I'm I still playing this game and even bought of those DLC...
0;Updating my review This game continuously is catering to survivors. Survivors being able to communicate in game breaks the core concept of the game. Now they are worsening it even further.When you get to higher ranked play the ability to communicate makes it near impossible for the killer to do anything.Top it all off with the countless bugs that never go away this game just becomes nothing but frustrating. GG BHVR was fun while it lasted.
0;im sorry to say that im now very unhappy with the game its not working for me and is to slow pluse when i get off the game i have to restart me computer because i cant watch anhythingplease if you get this text me back i would like to see what the problem is with the game and whi its slower this it was on my other computer that wasnt for games
0;rank system emblem patch.cant rank up anymore with the new emblem rank system rank gets reset every 13th of the month. no REWARDS for ranking gameplay just gets worse to killer camping and tunneling hard. just a peice of sht game. pls dont buy thisgames only fun for like 1 2 hours per session anymore than that is frustrating HAHAHAA
0;"""A perfect game that went from 100 to a zero.""""Do you know how hard it is to pull of a perfect loop?"""" Nah there is no skill needed.If u want to play killer and enjoy it don't even consider.There is no way to improve as a killer no matter what u do Survivors will run around pallets till the game is over."""
0;Product received for free. This game can get really boring after 50 hours on it please dont whaste your money on this.iTS 20 DOLLARS WTF PLUS THE DLC WHICH MEANS IF YOU ESIMATE THE GAME IS REALLY35 DOLLARS WHICH IS 2/3 OF THE GAME AND 1/3 OF COURSE YOU CAN STILL PLAY BUT IT GETS SOOO BORING!!!!! Look all i have to tell you is i whasted my money on this trash game and i dont want that happening on anyone else
0;Game is full of toxic players. killers who camp and tunnel. Survivors who use perks that are toxic to play against and then teabag. I spent a lot of time playing this game and used to enjoy it. lately its just made me sad to play. i get on for a few hours and never actually play a game because of all the toxic play. The worst part is these toxic players get rewarded for thier toxic play. Its sad. So very sad. I wish i had my money and my time back.
0;Very bad game full of bugs game mechanics is bad killers tunnel players and players loop killers very boring play dynamic.Also you need to know that this game has not dedicated server. The killers host the game so they can lag your connection as they want. Killer is in trouble? No problem. He just open youtube and your game start to lag you cannot play and he kills you easily. Wow. Really fair.Don't buy.
0;The developers don't test their games before patches and they ruin the gameplay with every patch and the communities always whine and highlight the problems and issues but the developers do not listen. Do not waste your time spend it on youtube watching ppl play is alright but don't spend your money on this.
0;"""Just stop playing this Rank 20 full of deranking rank 1 Rank 10 full of scumbags. Rank 1 full of the same you will find in your way there. You can't literally play this game. The devs are just trash and can't manage the game community is full of toxic russian kids who can't even speak english and just say """"ez"""" after they hide mid chase. go back to csgo idiots. The russian kids ruin every ing game they come to."""
0;great game has a few problems like the killer being pointless after rank 10 there are few killers if they have the perks that could kill you all but most of the time the survivors win beacause...........hatch10/10 would be looped and pallet againso there was this one time they had a good killer but dont worry they nerfed it to Your welcome bitvh survivors
0;It's fun when you can actually find a lobby. There are some frustrating mechanics when playing the killer such as spots where it's impossible to catch survivors if you're playing a certain killer and if they play ring around the rosey with a window but I only play the nurse now so now I have people complaining about me breaking game mechanics rather than the other way around.Edit Nurse was nerfed there are still spots survivors are immune game is too easy for survivors at high ranks.
0;Product received for free. Before I think this game was the most fun I had played but lately there has been a lot of wallhack and cheat that makes me lose some interest taking the game. and not least some error on the game. so before I could recommend the game but not now anymore
0;PROS Great game ideea.CONS Too many campers rage quiters and players who take the game hostageI had fun playing this game for 350 hrs under 30 fps on lowest settings enev tho this game is very buggy.The comunity is so salty and overpopulated by kids under 12 years old even tho this is a horror game.You will experience 1v3 cause of quiters.In the end i think that this game does hape potenitial but the devs are caring more about the money than their game.
0;So I have played this for a good amount of hours and even have three dlc's for it but this game is so buggy and broken that it ruins the experience for me. Freddy the new killer A.K.A Sandm an is Op and broken. The hag is broken. The Cannibal is OP with a AOE one shot. Devs choose not fix like what is going on lol? I also cannot do killer rounds now? what is this bug?
0;Please....Make this game BETTER!!!WTF happen to you delevoper?I don't need more DL ing C right now.I need you to solve all ing BUGssssss problem. ing SEARCHING problem...Wait 15 Mins To Play ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ing game...R U ing kidding me?PS. Right now your game is suck... really suck... so don't make it SUCKER.
0;I really like the gameplay but I really hate the lobby system!! There is no effing excuse to have to wait 60 seconds from when the fourth suvivor joins to when the matchs loads. The timer reaches ten seconds then boom someone leaves! The option to start match when there is only one survivior should have been added! Plus the is the fact this game eats RAM. It was running at 4.5GB when I ran it for an hour! I cannot recommend this game til the Devs fix some of the issues with it!!
0;the devs are destroying a great game randomly banning people for no reason then when they try to send in an email to get unbanned or get their items back they get ignored I'm honestly starting to think that they are happy with how much money they made off it and dont care about the game anymore.
0;Getting people banned for no reason. Noob3 OchiDO Monto. I don't know why but im guessing that they might have shown some exploits to their viewers. But its not bannable if they show an exploit than ing fix your game and don't randomly ban people. A lot of hard work got lost.
0;"""To Many Fkn buggs no servers so the one who plays as """"killer"""" will be the host. a killer with bad connection super laggy and almoast impossible game to play. Way to many buggs as i mentioned earlier game is extremly unbalanced. Survivors wont get punished for """"Trolling or Greifing"""" So my point is.... dont buy this game if you are not a fan of rageing....."""
0;The game is nice don't get me wrong but the entire staff is literally a joke including the mods on discord. When you try to ask for help they literally bash you for trying to communicate with them I even received a warning for trying to communicate regarding my issue with the game. They take days to reply to email and everytime they fix a bug 5 more pop up. The list goes on and on personally I would suggest for you to wait for last year the game it is coming out soon!
0;In it's current state i can't say i recommend this game. There's just too many balance issues that make it unfun to play as killer. While this game has alot of promise the devs haven't showed to me that they have the ability to fix this game. I'll check up on Dead by Daylight every now and then and will change my review if the game gets better. But for now i would not recommend you buy this game.
0;Pretty good game in alpha state that has been released as full game. This game is full of exploits and bugs but is really good and funny to play. 9/11. /edit I trusted devs for making this game a really good co op but they rather chosen the way of DLCs nad NEW STUFF FOR A LOT OF MONEY WORTHLESS GAME DEFINITELY NOT WORTH TO BUY ANYMORE A LOT OF EXPLOITS AND BUGS AFTER 6 MONTHS.
0;The game was fun in the beginning but now the killers are way too op and all DBD does is keep making killers stronger. At this point it is unbearable for me and they just keep on moving in the wrong direction. I would only recommend this game to someone seeking to play killer.
0;Tbh i just feel it's a game where they are just trying to make more money off of it instead of improve the game when it has things that need improving and/or fixing. It can be fun but mostly only with friends seeing how this game has a huge toxic fanbase and the devs don't care and somewhat support it.
0;Can you please make servers for Russians only? They're cancer.And fix the problem with tunnelers and hook campers then this game might be worth to buy.But still this game is pretty good. At least I can feels some emotions while playing sometimes negative ones sometimes positive. Well mostly those bad but...Ranking system sucks so hard even when you'll make 20k bp in game you can still don't get the pip and devs won't listen to players
0;"""Was a great game upon release but the game has become too much of a """"video game"""" if that makes sense. I hate how everyone can have each others perks I don't like how the survivors are blatantly stronger than the killer I hate how there's a """"meta"""" in a supposed """"horror game"""".6/10 the devs will probably ban me after this post )"""
0;fun game if you play it with friend. and really frustated if you trying as a killer.1 year ago this game is booming. even there there is unbalance here and there. some people can overcome this some are not.Bad SEA server dont brother to buy the game is dead in our server. you are going to have a hard time to find a match if you playing as a killer. this happen because most of killer comunity is cry baby person. because so many nerf again survivor no one play this game anymore on SEA server.
0;"""Played for almost 900 hours since last Dec.It pains me to put the thumb down but however it is truly what I am thinking about this game right now.All I want to say is can people really understand """"asymmetrical"""" this word or it means just unfair for themHow long i can survive during the match depends only on the amount of the pallets but totally not how I played then why should I carry on with this game?"""
0;A killer with a mini sqirt. No power notin just a sissy girl. A soilder a dedective a brave man who been in fights running from a sissy girl. This must be a joke. Dont buy couse devalopers start becoming sexual tinkers rather than logical. Unless ur a horny boi just dont buy.
0;this game its broken AF many times when i complete an action like wiggle i complete it but it doesnt let me fall off from the killer this game is nearly as broken as pubg and some killers are OP like freddy pls get this damn game fixed and the community btw is TOXIC AF when im the killer nomatter WHAT i get reported for camping( even though i dont) and get reps ive never had that many as i got from 1 game now its 2018 its better but still buggy
0;Actually a really fun game if you don't mind a game that plays like it is in beta still. Prepare for alot of bugs.Update Still alot of bugs and daily rituals to escape with certain people don't work half of the time so I never get my points. Also did this to a friend. Maybe if they fix this and more I'll give it a good review again.
0;"""if you wanna be a survivor main and say this game is good then by all means in all honesty theres a reason why killers leave this game at a rapid rate because it ing sucks. """"Horror"""" more like lets bully the killers please change the game genre to comedy because this game is a laughable excuse of horror."""
0;Its cheap and gets a lot of fun just DONT GO TO THE FORUMS DONT PLAY SOLO AND LEAVE EVERY MATCH AFTER YOU DONE LOL always play on voice wiht your friends and you can have fun.Comunity of this game is TOXIC AS Hell P.S Dont over do in the hours or is gonna become a hate and love relationship game
0;The game was great fun as a survivor but then the hoardes of terrible players began to emerge the main limitation of this game at the moment is match making with new players being matched up with more experienced ones they metaphorically get dicked upon. It takes longer than 2 games to be paired with actual survivors.Could you incorporate a *practice based tutorial* on a players intial game to introduce them to all the components of playing?
0;Liked the game very much before but after The Pig was added to the game and all the nerfs to survivors came after her update i found it not fun as a survivor. I used to love playing survivor but the game changed too much after all the nerfs to survivor perks. Killer wasn't even hard to play before. But over all not fun anymore would not recommend unless they make a vanilla mode.
0;Devs don't care. Customer service tickets and player reviews go to nowhere. Pray to your gods that you don't lose progression... because the devs will not make you whole unless you are in the very fortunate minority. There is no profit to be had as they already have your money.Community is generally toxic but if you find a pocket of decency you should cling to it as long as possible. Good luck if you get this game.
0;Now Dead by Daylight is a great great game and I think it's one of the best co op survival games out there. But I've encountered numerous bugs/glitches and also a lot of hackers that the developers just don't care enough to fix/ban which makes the game a lot of fun. Like when you have a trapper placing bear traps everyone or a glitched survivor. So I wouldn't recommend it unless they could fix a lot of these problems.
0;THIS GAME IS UNBALANCED. FIX YOUR GAME MATHIEU COTE AND THE REST OF THE DEVS. THE SURVIVORS ARE TOO WEAK AND KILLERS ARE TOO OP. I PLAYED 5 GAMES AS WRAITH WITH NO PERKS AND KILLED EVERY SURVIVOR EVERY ROUND I PLAYED. ALSO BRING BACK THE MOVEMENT FROM 1.3
0;i enjoy this game but the devs are they keep pushing very unfriendly anti consumer ideas. their trying really hard to push microtransactions. the community is pretty toxic lots of kids and grown adults that act like children and don't cooperate in this cooperative game so if your going to get it get it with friends.
0;"""If you want toxic &amp #(#)$! # calling you a lag switcher then this is the game for you.

0;So here we are with dbd not being a god game the lagswitches are constant the toxic people are endless and people saying that your hacking is over the top and this game is not balenced what so ever removing vacum pallets was a bad step and making fast vaults slow vaults is actually if i was maneging this game i would go back to 1.4 please devs just go back to 1.4
0;"""Used to be fun. Now the developpers don't care if the game is fun. They only care if it's """"balanced"""". Have fun slowly crawling over a window sill while a 10' tall monster is chasing you or the killer swinging from 10' behind you sliding behind you instantly and slaping the out of you. They don't care if the game is fun you're their and you'll play what they give you."""
0;Game is no where close to balanced. Salty killers can decide your fate completely. If they want to ruin one persons game they absolutely can because its like they are the dungeon master. The game is far from skill based. Killers have so much aura reading they may as well have wall hacks. You get one 2nd life perk which is decisive strike and killers can juggle you or slug you to avoid it. Game was designed by a bunch of half brain money snatchers. Do not buy this piece of product.
0;Earlier it was lesser more good game now creators of this shet hear only maniacs game become totally disbalanced where your skill can't be shown by anything either you maniac who makes 4 each match just because devs make it such easy shet or survivor who might be a good runner but still get rekt cause of no pallets and other stuff. Somewhen i loved this game much now its balance is broken apart
0;There was a 21 9 resolution workaround that I was using for a while. Then I stopped playing the game and they removed it. Now I actually see less than other people. If they fix I will change it to a positive feedback.Update They still haven't added it back and probably never will.
0;The Nurse is actually stupid no joke. She's not hard and probably one of the easiest to play even without add ons. (same thing with The Spirit) AND survivor's hitboxes are massive. Making it seem like the killer hits so hard that the wind is the thing that hits them.
0;when you are killer and there is a survive with friends group that all they do is loop every single person i went up to loops a window a pallet and theres nothing to do about it the only thing you can do these days is ing play with noobs thats are like rank 20 or 15 or 10 this just don't seem right
0;Its a very nice survival game but it needs some work to be perfect and some balance.You also need to focus at the community needs cause you may lose players...i dont anymore recomend this game i explain why right here https //steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1696045708663734053/my personal score was 9/10 my personal score is 7/10 updatedmy personal score is 3/10
0;I play it since release.The game was nice but they destroyed it the killers are too strong. Every new killer has more op perks witch destroy the game. The survivors perks are fixed and balanced but killerperks are way to strong.When i play killer i always get 3 4 kills cause its to easy. The legion is a joke. His ability to rush is very unbalanced.Pls fix the killers they are way to easy to play.I enjoyed the game in the past but now its broken.sorry dead by daylight but its not fun anymore.
0;"""The Killerrole is WAY TOO STRONG and the Killer always use the same perks (nurses noed bbq and ruin) i played a lot of matches this night and only got this perk combination. I played like 15 matches and survived 3 or 4...(I'm not that bad) it's a really """"balanced"""" game...dont buy this game until its balanced so you should never buy it!"""
0;So here we are. 1500 hours in... And I can't stand the game anymore. The developers don't care about the game and are just in it to make more skins and micro purchases. Due to balance issues and lack of fun the game has became unplayable. Was once a great game then Mcote (A developer of the game) broke it. Doubt I will return but was fun while it lasted.
0;While I admit that the game is fun what is not fun though are paid characters. Now I know that these characters are like 7 8 usd a piece when was the last time that a character(s) were given for free? I think that the last one was The Huntress which was ages ago. While I do agree that the game needs to make money it would be nice to give something for free too. I mean Legion would have been wonderful Christmas present for the community instead they opted to monetize him/her.
0;Broken loading screen brings me down every time. And I definitely CAN'T match other player when I create a lobby as a killer (Rank 20). Why would u save that event item in my inventory after event period but not gonna let me use/delete it.And I think some killers are OP such as THE DOCTOR his ''electric ability'' cover the whole map sometimes and the effects on survivor never fade out no matter what you do.
0;A game that started off as a load of fun now an empty husk of what it was met some great people and had a lot of laughs but after all the 'balancing' the game is incredibly tedious and a sad mess of toxicity not to mention the the devs and their habit of breaking that didnt need touching recent nerf to leader has proven the devs for sure have iq's in the negatives cannot wait to uninstall ) basically avoid if you dont hate yourself
0;After play game for a while i found many problem.1. stuck in loading screen. (first initailized)2. after play 1 or 2 game and find new lobby game stuck at loading screen with no progress bar.3. in game nearly end ( last servivor i'm playing as killer) game crash. (face this many times)4. after playing for 3 5 minutes game crash. (face this many times)this game are 10 bucks but have 10 million bugs....
0;To keep it short... This game is probably the worst possible experience you can have with video games.it's such a godawful game the devs should honestly be ashamed of themselves for what they've done. It's a waste of my time and yours. Terrible game. Never consider it at all.
0;dont buy that game it sucks i asked friendly if i can get a second chance ( i cheated me legacy 2 and 3 ) and i got perma banned and now i asked after 2 years if i can get a chance i sayed you guys can reset my account i accpet it but they saying ever the same thing.... i hate these stupid supporter....
0;Bug .. PRETTY GOOD JUB AS ... Cant drop pallet when is killer in bug with dead hard bug with pallets On EUROPE playing with ASIAN players or AMERICA PING 200+ / 300+ Hackers with speed hack / Lag hack Bad job so far Good game ( Maybe 5 months back ) PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME AND DONT ADD KILLERS THX
0;only fun way to play as killer is to go as lvl1 killer with nothing equiped vs 4 lvl 50 full equiped survival. Only fun way to play survival is to play with premates. Balancing is absolut in this game. Possibility how to play is very limited. Map design is average. Hope there will be a fix to this
0;It would be a good gamed if it were balanced but because the devs change how most aspects work with every update it's not worth buying. the game is usually broken as hell and gets worse with every new killer/survivor.Ps The bugs that are in the game get fixed a year after they are discorvered by players.

Game is very unbalanced and is repetitive as killer.Game can also be boring for survivors if you go against a killer that knows how to use BL and tunnels and facecamps you or if you go against a Nurse.
0;Odds stacked against most killers and especially on one map. No option to try out new killer without being harassed. Still a orginal game that created a new genre. Recommended more for survivors than for Killers. Considerable bugs after some updates ike the game suddenly thinking game files have been hacked.Spending any money on the game as survivor is something that should be given thought as there are two DLC kIllers that will just lock down the game and make it nearly unwinnnable for you.
0;This is a definitely fresh and attractive game. However I have questioned developer's balancing and bug fixing. As the bugs are fixed more new bugs might be met. Plus between survivors and killers among killers game balance is not going better. The developers recognize OP play but they DO NOT have plan to fix. It might bring you many stresses. You need inner peace when playing the game.
0;I use to have a lot of fun on this game. With or without friends. I stopped playing for a good eight months because I got bored of it and the community was just toxic all around. Sad to say same boring game eight months later. the community has gotten a little better However I do not think this game is worth the time to play.
0;Very asymmetrical based a lot on skills and trolling.Communication is key and this game does not have that.Does not have pretty graphics and has some bugs.Not fun with less than 4 survivors.Not fun with troll / lagged / obsessive / camper killer neither with troll / lagged / ragequitter survivors.
0;This game is the funniest joke of 2019. This turd cant even load in 5 players good luck getting a full match. No patches for a month fixing issues but have no problem releasing new dlc or shop items.And if you do get a full match enjoy the facecamp and tunnel mode 5000. And a toxic after game lobby. 1/1000000
0;This game is so eerygame I go in has a killer with NoED a facecamping myers a leatherface or a doctor with OP perks and Ad ons this game is so the community is toxic every killer that I go against brong NoED and I ing hate this game so ing much can't wait for the ability to do gens in 15 sec with the new leader buff. killers they are so ing OP.
0;I used to like this game but now it just crashes. A lot. It's not even every other game it's more often than that. I have to keep alt tabbing and closing the game through task manager. There are many threads about this on the forum but no mention has been made about it by the devs.Buying this game as is is a gamble. It may crash on you more often than not or it may not. Ultimately it's your money to gamble but I wouldn't get it as is.It's a shame.
0;If I had not met my wife on this game theres no way I would have sunk a total of 83 days of my life into this...... women make you do crazy boys. Game is a shell of its former self completely gutted of everything fun. I'll never forget the days of old when I would play for 12 hours straight with a full 4 man. Too bad its not fun to play survivor at all anymore because every killer tunnels and camps. Devs are and have no idea what they're doing.
0;"""Running on an i5 7500k and a 4GB VRAM AMD 560 Pro with 8GB RAM and when i join a game i get stuck on the loading screen and it said """"Not Responding"""" and BETA was much better since it had fast loading screens. So don't buy this game even though you have a decent PC. And the devs will not probably respond to this comment because they only need ideas from people who ask to add """"this"""" and """"that"""" into the game without even fixing it."""
0;Huge potential and great concept. Unfortunatelly not finished. It is plagued by bugs many game breaking bugs.I played 80 hours. During this time all bugs were slowly building up to the point I can't progress with the game anymore. Terrible state. Don't buy it now wait at least 6 months.
0;"""Multiplayer is sucking a** right now i can't even play with my friends without having problems with """"connection"""" (my internet is fine) and a lot of people are having the same disconnection problem....I can't even enter a matchmaking session there's always a error related to that..."""
0;Fun when it works.Very poor quality console port. Multiplayer is broken most of the time.Denuvo and anti tamper eat up your CPU. There are hundreds of checks being done whenever you do actions in the game as part of the DRM. On top of that the terrible texture resolution is really disappointing. No HD texture pack being offered is garbage.Performance is 30 40% worse than games with similar visual fidelity. Other games with better graphics also run better than this does.
0;Even with revision 152771 that claim to fix disconnection issues the problem remain. Since launch not a single day pass without me or one of my friends disconnecting mid game at least once. It is pretty ridiculous seeing that no other online games that I play exhibit such an issue. Other than that the game is not well optimized but runs well on my rig. While the single player experience is great multiplayer is one of the game's main selling point I can not recommend it at its current state.
0;Not worth it until they fix the following 1. No raw mouse input the game implements the mouse as a joystick2. No way to disable motion blur and depth of field3. Clunky multiplayer requires each member to have watch the mission's cutscenes beforehand4. No way to exit the game during a mission you have to abandon first (c'mon it's 2018)5. Denuvo DRMOther irritating stuff 1. Really bad clipping2. Silent protagonist style3. Limited voiceovers and reaaally bad dubbing4. Walls of text everywhere
0;What were they thinking with this multiplayer system?They had a perfectly fine way to handle online questing. This is frustrating trying to play with friends.Don't play this for the multiplayer which is one of the big draws for the game in the first place...
0;THIS GAME IS BASSICALY UNPLAYABLE FOR MULTIPLAYER.Game wise this game is good very fun. The problem is ME AND MY FRIENDS CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME AT ALL without someone disconnecting every 10 mins. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT THE CURRENT STATE unless you are playing this game for single player SOO ANNOYING.
0;pc players waited 6 months because they where filling the game with denuvo and nothing else no optimitation or pc setting you would expectbeat this in about 40 hours never played a monter hunter before but i dont think there ment to be this shortmultiplayer dosnt workno contentevents are and give you nothinggo play Pso2 its free and way more content and cooler boss fights japanese version ofcourse

0;I have about 100hrs in the game with my friend and but I'm pretty sure about 40hrs of those are lost due to disconnecting and restarting the quests. After all these dcs I've finally managed to play the post game only to have someone dc at the start of the first 60seconds of the 1st quest. Actual trash game DON'T BUY THIS if you're trying to play mutliplayer you'll actually have ptsd everytime you try to play any multiplayer game.
0;The game constantly disconnects and it's near impossible to play co op with others. It's frustruating fighting a monster just to dc and are either forced to leave or try to kill a hp boosted monster that takes forever. The main reason I got this game was to play with my friends but most of the time i find myself soloing most things as it's too frustruating constantly dcing.Also how do you release a game on pc without proper kb mouse controls? Capcom pls.
0;Fun game i've been waiting for a monster hunter game on pc for ages. It seemed to play well on my system. I had to refund it though because I kept getting connection errors. For the price i don't want to play a 50+ hour game solo. I have other games for that kind of experience. Might pick it up again when its on a big sale and when the issues have been addressed.
0;FIX THE GOD D.!AMN SEVER ISSUE !!!It is almost impossible to play with friends and even multiplayer !!!I bought this game for $60 but I don't think you guys provide service to users enough.If you guys keep providing game service like this (including server issue).It doesn't need to be $60.This game is good enough and fun but you guys' service makes me annoyed so much.
0;Thumbs down till they fix the communtication error BS. I should be able to play with my friends and yet every hunt i get in i end up getting kicked into a solo hunt while the monster keeps its multiplayer bonus. This is stupid Can't believe i'm saying this but the PS4 version is better. Never had these communtication errors on the PS4. I'm done playing this game till they fix this issue.
0;The game's amazing but the connection issues are blatant and I'm not kidding when I say that you'll disconnect literally every 10 minutes if not more often. It's insane how impossible it is to play with friends. If you like playing solo Monster Hunter then by all means buy this game but if you planned on even two manning anything this is not the game for you.
0;This you need to know There is So much fail to connect in this game I can never get to play with my friends session. Its so funny that since the game came out in console this problem been here.. If i was you in never waste $60 on this wait till it goes on sale..

0;As a P2/P2G/P3 player it remains to be seen whether the gameplay is solid or masterpiece.No performance issue so far.

0;I am not going to change this review even if this get fixed. 7 months into refining the PC port and i cannot stay connected for more than 5 minutes in any multiplayer session not even with friends. I currently regret not refunding the game right away instead of trying to solve the problem on my own. This is something that shouldn't ever happen especially on a triple A game in 2018.
0;Pre ordered the game should have come with 2 DLCsDidn't get eithr of them they show up in my purchase history Game runs pretty horrible on minimum graphics settings multiple friends say the same.Playing with friends is a pain to do not only because of the awkward system but because of the connection issues as well.Game crashes quite often and doesn't keep your progress if it does.Edit Found out why the DLC's weren t there i had to tick the checkmarks on them under the DLCs section of the game

0;"""Game itself is Fun to play.However there are 2 main problems.1. Frequent Disconnection Fix it. You made enough money within 3 days. It's time to fix your server.2.

0;Great game with glaring issues. Connection issues fix the tabbing issues support wide screen 8 monthes extra to throw together a messy port.I'd love to give it a good rating to support future PC versions of MH but if they're of this quality I'd rather play them on my hand helds.I'll reccommend it once the issues that would be resolved within the first week of launch in any other game are fixed.
0;* No 4k Check* Derpnuvo Check* No PS4 button layout Check* No HDR Check* No Ultra Wide Screen CheckI'm only happy because it is on PC and I dont have to fireup my Potato Station 4 to play this. That and on SSD it loads almost instantaneously.As it stands right now I do not recommend this game. Wait for sale price.
0;"""If you're a fan of Skyrims radiant """"murder the gang leader"""" quests that's all this game is.Combat is repetitive and boring.

Crafting and smithing are uncreative and underwhelming.Weapon and armor designs are either good looking or are good gear but never both.Mei from overwatch guest stars as your partner so that's something I guess"""
0;Seven months of waiting. Bad optimization. Didn't include any content update console received since launch. Ultra graphic setting equals to console graphics No 21 9 support in 2018. Still charge you at full price.Don't buy this game on PC if you already have a console. Campom don't deserve your money.
0;I am a huge fan of Monster Hunter through the ages. Having played since gen1. This game is a huge step forward for the series. However Capcom several months after release still haven't fixed the rampant connection issues with the game. Which is a huge issue for a game where you fight a monster for 30 40 minutes just to drop from a well coordianted group and lose everything since the fight is designed to be handled by multiple people. (arch tempered dragons)
0;Game is fine if you dicide to be a lonewolf in MHW. the multiplayer mode is a TOTAL SHXT my crew and me always got disconect from sessions and went to offline mode sometimes you could rejoin the session and rejoin the quest through SOS but its really annoying and you cant rejoin the session if the host disconnect.
0;DO NOT PURCHASE IF You want to play mouse/keyboardYou want to play with friendsYou want a clean easy to navigate experienceDO PURCHASE IF You can put up with laggy garbage inputYou love dealing with convoluted unbindable keysYou love dealing with a console game ported to PC with nothing useful for PC play added
0;The game falls to a lot of red flags when it comes to gaming unskippable cutscenes with extremely boring and subpar story highly marketed multiplayer locked behind said cutscenes most viable builds involve wearing clowsuits with no chance of good armor or weapon transmogrificationThese issues alone make the game a no go zone. You're better off playing an older iteration of MonHun like 4 Ultimate than this.
0;"""Yeah you can't have """"world"""" in the title with a co op system this convoluted taking seven windows to navigate. Constant offline disconnects mid mission on both sides which leaves you alone with a buffed monster. I hear co op is almost as bad on PS4 which begs the question how low are PS4 player standards to give this a good review?"""
0;"""""""You have lost connection""""You will see this every single time you try and play co op with anyone in this game I cannot finish a single game with friends who are in the same room . """"We want to take our time to optimize MH World for PC""""This game runs like crap and stutters on my 1080 16GB of RAM and Ryzen 7 PCThe game is fantastic WHEN IT WORKS Which at this point is never stay far away until this gets fixed."""
0;Honestly I bought this game just to play with my friends but I'm constantly getting disconnect errors and it's completely ruining my experience of the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who plans on playing multiplayer. Single player is alright but multiplayer is where it shines.... if you could stay connected.
0;Online features suck as when you try to play with friends. Blocking you out of missions if they player hasn't seen certain cutscenes and It is a random match singleplayer game advertised as a multiplayer game? They just ed up online features too much I would stay away if that is the thing that interests you. At least until they fix all the t.
0;As a big monster hunter fan I can't recommend this version at the moment.I played the PS4 version which already had connection problems for 200 hours and now they present us with this.The SOS System is not working for 85% of the day because the servers don't work.The performance is horrible and sinks to sub 20 fps in fights against elder dragons becauseof the particle effects.I would only recomend this game if you don't care about the frame drops and want to play solo at the moment.
0;Constant disconnects. The servers are absolute garbage. Another issue is ERR 12 Graphics device has crashed. I'm running an overclocked 1080. Every time this error occurs I lose all progress since last save. Fix your game it could be GOTY but not in this state. Also why does a 2018 game run at a maximum of 60fps on my $4000 pc? It's a joke and I really wish it wasn't.
0;I would 100% recommend this game if the latest patch didn't cause crash on startup.Anyway play it if you like ARPGs. Fantastic rewarding combat cool exploration mechanics lots of play value etcetc.Biggest flaw is its endgame content. Endgame can be reached a little too soon (there's also some filler content) and there's not much to do besides throw yourself at RNGesus's feet every 5 10 minutes.
0;Joins online session starts nergigante with friends to farm for materials difficulty adjusted for a full party of 4 players eats food and is hyped for the battle. Unsheathes weapon Error 5038f MW1Aaaaand you have to deal with a 4 hunter difficulty Nergigante or you can abandon the quest and the whole cycle repeats. Your choice.
0;Why? Why sell a port to PC and it's NOT to our standards of FINISHED PRODUCT. Faith in game companies are on a downward decline...why is that? When your wallet is making your choices of game development you get a game like this. No gamepad control scheme hard to co op and disconnects like a boss. Can I get HALF MY MONEY BACK and when you FINISH THE GAME you get the rest. Seems fair.
0;"""Until this game stops with the random disconnects I'm gonna have to put this as a """"Do Not Purchase"""".Compared to the previous Monster Hunter games this version ball and chains you to story missions instead of letting the player run free to join their friends on missions.Along with that why is there no """"Skip"""" button on Cut Scenes? Lastly the game doesn't feel well optomized.I'm running an i5 4690 with 32gbs of RAM and a GTX 980 and I'm still getting massive frame rate drops at LOW."""
0;This game seems to be never optimized. The terrible frame rate and annoying crashing problems stopped me being quite a fan of MH from leaving a positive comment. Also runing this game seems a kind of torture to my CPU.If you are someone who evaluates the graphic performance probably you need to think twice before purchasing this god damn game.
0;I've been playing this game for 19 hours and I can't play with my friends for even once. Always been that connection error. I can't believe I pre order this crap. If it is not finished just don't sell it in the market. This is the worst purchasing I have ever made.
0;Right now I stop playing this game because the stutter problem once you reach the Elder's Reccess makes the game unplayeble. My main issue is the lightning particles that drop my fps counter to 10 15 constantly. The bad general optimization conection errors and a thousand of specifics errors are the main facts to wait and dont buy the game.Just be patience.
0;"The delays are killing this game and making it unplayble. I am only getting items into my inventory 2 3 secs after having done so I am getting hit and killed 2 3 secs after being behind cover. It became worse since the latest updates. If you have a test server why put this turd on the ""Stable"" one. Are you that wise?!"
0;FIX THE DAMN CONNECTION PROBLEMS ALREADY? are you serious?????? I join a game 4 versus a Xeno'jiva start attacking it.... everythings fine then boom connection problem 3 dudes disconnect AT LEAST MAKE IT SO THE MONSTERs DAMN HP GOES BACK DOWN TO a 1 PLAYER VARIENT like i mean seriously???? you want someone to sit there for 5 hours killing a monsteR?????? fix your damn game jeez.
0;If only this game has a standalone server and dun depend on steam New UI up all our game with connection issues Monster Hunter World shud change to Monster Hunter Solo till they even fix this br&gt Overall nice game if u wanna play single player for now but thumbs down till they fix the connection
0;"""Great if you don't mind surviving and bashing up bigger and bigger monsters challenging yourself to bash them with a of assorted weapons tools potions and other gadgets on a """"could be better optimised"""" game. Cross your fingers and hope the devs better work on optimisation better networking more monster variety and mod support? probably not mod support would be good though.Voting no to starve off the staggering praise for it."""
0;The game is good I'm happy to play it... BUT ther's so much to improve. bad FPS bad GPU utilization bad monsters (NPC) moves bad hitboxes bad servers stability (crashes for no reasons.) good gameplay (exept the things I said up here) fun to play with friends big maps many monsters many weapons/setsnot a bad game in general but the things that needs to be fixed are many and are so annoying.
0;The only people who call this game a good PC port are the ones with high end maxed out gaming rigs. Trust me it isn't well optimized at all. If you can deal with that and the fps drops the game is fine and fun though. So yeah I recommend the game itself just maybe not the PC version unless you have a beast rig the minimum requirements are very misleading(you gonna need more)
0;frequently DC 5 minutes into the game and DC everytime! Might as well remove the Multi player tag from the game(2/9 update)Heard that you fixed the connection. Nice ing error code 83 game disconnected mid game so I have to fight the monster alone with multiplayer diffcult alone! Have to abandon the game and that happened quite a lot! Serious wtf
0;I can't recommend this game until they fix the constant disconnects from public games. This game is grindy enough without constantly wasting hours due to a sudden disconnect. Everything else stays connected. Only MHW disconnects. Other games I play never have this issue.
0;Hey want a game with good developers that work on the issues their game has? Then keep looking this is not the game you are looking for. 2 weeks after release and not a single update has come out and doubtfully will. There are bunches of bugs posted daily in their discussion board. Guess what though. . . . THE DEVS DO NOT RESPOND TO THEM. This should be a great game but the people behind it suck.
0;"""Don't buy this title if you intend to hunt with your friends. I tried so many ways and get around for the constant """"disconnection/Error 83 MW1"""". But to no avail. This is just another solo player game.And i feel that the controls for keyboard and mouse are not optimise which kinda forces users to get a gamepad and play on it instead. REALLY REALLY disapointed in CAPCOM for this port over."""
0;I enjoyed my initial playthrough of this game however the end game consists of grinding investigations for decorations with a 0.4% chance to drop and to complete certain builds you'll need several of these rare decorations. This type of uninspired lazy game design needs to be a thing of the past. If you like grind you may like this game.
0;Game corrupted my save file and wont even lunch anymore. Fix your capcom.Update Managed to repair the game made a new save file and drag my to the final boss again game corrupt my save file AGAIN. This is unacceptable capcom! FIX YOUR ING GAMEUpdate2 it's now january and the save file problem as not been fixed yet...
0;Great game with awful customer treatment Developer that doesn t care for the player base Months Behind on content 8 months Behind on release Parity / with worst graphics quatily than consoles Lack of communication Full price Server are garbage DenuvoHonestly if you have patient just hold on for the crack... Dont support crapcom as developer...Sadly I did...
0;TLDR Version.Storyline is great.Gameplay great.Endgame just ends up being a lottery.You take a pull and hope for the best but the house always wins.I've killed literally over a hundred elder dragons and having nothing to show for it.I'm sure more people put in more time but I'm leaving this alone.Don't mind the grind however this is just unrewarding in the end.
0;So really good game. I've put almost 100 hours into it and still haven't completed all the quests they've given me though I did finish the main story (also took a long time). I would give the game a thumbs up if it was possible for me to access the multiplayer content but everytime I've tried it kicks me after about 15 minutes with an error message. As far as solo content goes still a solid game with a ton of variety. Just be careful if you're only getting it for the coop gameplay.
0;Game is fun and beautiful... WHEN IT WORKS.Constant crashing during grinding sessions and even multiplayer is extremely annoying.Paid extra for the bundled edition of the game. AAA game with an AAA price tag but results feel like it's supposed to be in Beta.Until the crashes are fixed I cannot recommend this game at its current price tag.
0;"""Game is good. Port is real bad and poorly optimized for PCs. The """"big patch"""" came one month later and didn't fix that much for me game still runs like and somehow I have more connection issues now than before where everything gets frozen and then kicks everyone out of online mode."""
0;this game is good but have server problem....this what i means by server problem.... when join friend session im always disconnect when communication error pop up....pls fix itits not happen only for me...its happen to all my friend and i think other player as welli really enjoy the game but with this problem maybe i will not enjoy for long...sorry for my bad english
0;Its not half as good as people make it out.Several design choices are absolutely baffling.The story is cringe worthy and there's no option to skip at all.The first half hour of the game is a complete waste of time.You can't mute NPCs regardless of how irritating they are.Cat companions Why? Just why. There's no violence at all.Virtually every weapon looks rediculous. Coop is integrated beyond poorly.Maybe there's a fun game buried beneath the frustration.But to be blunt.I just don't care.
0;Some people are reversing their decisions to give this a negative review. I will not be doing so because the servers are in fact NOT fixed. Better and fixed are different. Disconnections are still a daily occurence. And honestly? Considering they sold 10 million copies I think its pure laziness on their part. They made their money they're done. They COULD outsource it for a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions in profit they made but I doubt they will.
0;If it wasn't for the fact that you disconnect from online sessions every 5 minutes I would recommend this game. It's not a multiplayer game if it's almost entirely missing the multiplayer component. The disconnection issues has been present since the day it launched and it's still not fixed. Nearly every review complains about the disconnects as well so... just be aware of what you're buying.
0;The game is still buggy if you're okay with that go for it.But don't be shocked if something bizarre like fullscreen refusing to work 100 hours in happens like it happened to me. These random problems have happened to friends too. I'm an MH veteran and I can't believe Capcom released this game in such a buggy state on PC and refuses to fix all the issues. People say its fine now but there are still connectivity issues resolutions issues the game freezes sometimes temporarily etc..
0;This game is pure trash.Koreans learn how to develop games. You are just untalented developersThe Battle Royale Genre as of the end of 2018 is oversaturated with titlesThis one started all but never got to the point of getting to be a decent one buying this game is like throwing your money away..There are just better shooters out there today.
0;I play the game on a GTX 1060 6GB OC and an i5 6600 OC to 3.5mhz and still can't have stable fps with only the rendering setting on high (1080p). In fights like Teostra when she/he does a big AOE attack i go below 30fps. The nvidia pannel is set on performance btw. I hope they will do something about this cuz the game is so much fun my 100h on it says it all.
0;Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Thunder DROPS FPS and thunder element only. Why? I dont know.Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Keyboard and Mouse controllers are utter Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Random FPS drops!!Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Servers constantly disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.
0;For a series that's had a huge focus on multiplayer and cooperation the current state of MHW is simply not worth buying at all. Even if you only want the game as a single player experience the amount of content in the game is simply not worth the price tag.
0;After 100+ Hours of playing this game. It is pretty fun to be honest. BUT the crashing and disconnecting issues me the fk off. I was killing the ancient dragon to get my matierials for 2 days! After that I got the matierial i want last round and it crashed. But because it didnt save yet and means that i wasted my time and the matierials gone. And the aim assist system for bow is suck. and cant disable too Thanks for crashing the game. SO MUCH FUN )
0;I can't really recommend this game they already have a lot of dlc now thats is pretty much usless and still they charge you for it even though the game has issues. If you dont have a decently beefy computer good luck in the rotten vale biome because I have a fx 6300 cpu and nvidia 1050 ti which is a bit above minimum and still lag horrible on rotten vale.becareful before you buy this do your research.
0;First Monster hunter series that I am playing and it is SUPER great! I wish I could play it all day long. Online sucks like BIG TIME! Game is not optimized for PC hope that patches and fixes comes soon since it is way much better to play with friends!
0;The problems this game has have been present since the beginning and have not been fixed for no reason.they include bad netcode lag terrible deathcams so disjointed from what actually happened they might as well not exsist Bugs that seem quirky at first but now seem lazy.and more.What made pubg so popular was the potential it had but what has led to its decline in players and terrible reviews is the game in didnt life up too.
0;Don't buy this game on PC unless it's the only platform you own that can run it. The extra performance is not worth losing out on all the content that only consoles have.Capcom promised that PC players would get that content at an accelerated rate to catch up but that turned out to be a boldfaced lie we're actually getting it slower.I recommend the game just not for PC unless they drastically increase the rate of content updates.
0;Previous MH games average total monster count 100 (70 big 30 small)MHW (latest console version) 52 (34 big and 18 small)Only 5 locations. They haven't added new one since console launch 9 month ago and probably never will.Whole storyline can be fully covered in one sentence.As mh veteran I'm disappointed in content amount.P.S. My 200 hours contain lots of afk grind for tempered footsteps.
0;The gameplay in this game great and it still feels like classic monster hunter to me but the fact is this game has cause two blue screens of death and multiple crashes on a fairly high end system that I've done all the updates for. (at 1080p) So until this stops I cannot recommend buy this game in this state.
0;"""Feels like playing a beta ... even with solo gameplay working. It's just sad that something like that happens with a 60 title /There was so... sooo much time to work out how to get multiplayer working on PC but no.Just let the customer pay and suck it.That's really not how you should treat your Customers!Please remove Co op / Multiplayer from the game description because it's """"effectivly"""" not implemented. *sigh*"""
0;CAPCOM sucks badly never liked them and never will...This game very very annoying and ALT F4 isn't working WARNING!If your target monster wont kill you then Bazelgeuse will its the most annoying monster in the gaming world making this unbearable on higher levels of the game and seriously damage the user and my experience.
0;Game is a lot of fun Even more so early on. Later in the game you will notice the performence hits more and more. Current drivers for nvidia useally make the fps hits worse and it does not seem like capcom is able to fix the performence issues for awhile
0;Great game but does not run well at all on my 1080ti. Certain areas are unplayable since last patch and some monsters special attacks still make my game go below 25 frames. If you are not very passionate about mh in general you will definetly not have a good time because the game runs like absolute trash. Good optimization!
0;So I absolutely love this game and I have a lot of fun playing it but the pc port is janky and bad. The ps4 had trouble when it launched but those issues were quickly fixed. Its ridiculous how much the pc port kicks me from online and its ruined so many hunts in game that I'm honestly just sick and tired of it. I'll change this review when and if the connection issues are fixed but its been a while since the pc port launched so I rather doubt the issues will be fixed.
0;There has virtually never been a time that I've played the game for longer than an hour stretch where I haven't disconnected. The UI is not PC friendly in the slightest and even after logging hundreds of hours on this game and enjoying some aspects of it its faults outweight its positive attributes. This game is clearly a haphazard console to PC port avoid on this PC if you have the option.
0;The recent Kulve update introduced hitching and frametime spikes to the game and capcom refuses to acknowledge it.There have been multiple threads about this problem but they either die out or are ignored.Thread showing the problem https //steamcommunity.com/app/582010/discussions/3/2805074491019538041/ untill this gets fixed this review will stay as not recommended.
0;1. Buy this game if u want to play it solo because it is a ton of fun and the combat is engaging even the grind is fun imo because its just boss fight after boss fight.2. however dont buy this game if u want to play multiplayer or with your friends it is incredibly annoying the amount of disconnects you get from sos flares and from groups in general i join sos flares to not have to play solo and get dced probably 75 % of the time awesome game probably the worse servers i ever played on.
0;you cant play story missions with friends which means you can only side quest with them which is super disapointing. And if by some miracle you do get a friend or some other people in you'll most likely disconnect halfway through a fight because the servers are so awful.
0;Fun game enjoyed it until endgame where my min max side and fashion side collide between wanting to deal massive damage and looking like a clown and doing damage and looking like a beast bow gun min max armor is atrocious I absolutely hate the colorful yoga pants it makes me wear
0;I'll change my review when Capcom can get their together here. The game is horribly optimized for PC. For some people it's unplayable. Major FPS issues when fighting certain monsters and after the latest update my game will have periodic freezing which ruins the gameplay. I'm sure after a time this game will be a great addition to any PC library. But for now its utter trash.
0;It's a great game to play overall. The textures are mostly good the enemies can be fun to fight but it doesn't matter if you constantly DC/ the people youre playing with DC. Connection has been a constant issue throughout launch. Also why the is there so much trivial DLC? You have to pay almost $90 on top of the $60 base game so have fun shelling $150+ ( because knowing capcom they'll add more DLC later on costing more money.) just to have the entire game.
0;Great game terrible online/server connection.Everytime I queue up with a group of people or join them I get kicked out when I am halfway done with the mission. I have no problem solo ing monsters but I prefer to group up so I can finish missions faster. They need to fix this damn issue.
0;"""After one week this game has completely stopped launching for me!!!!! I have been dealing with capcom tech support for a week and the havent given me any advice better than """"restart your computer"""". Whats worse is that steam will not refund me because i intially played more than 2 hours before it stopped working. IT WILL NO LONGER LAUNCH AT ALL!!!! I recommend waiting until this thing gets patched a whole lot more before buying."""
0;good game at first just a shame about all the dam bugs etc so annoying that eventually u stop playing patch tommorow and there more concern about adding another monster than fixing the game says it all would only buy the game when they have fixed all the dont make the same mistake i did to be then
0;game is good game for ps4 only. please don't buy pc version.1 very bad performance issue unless you have a very expensive pc 2 didn't support ultra wide resolusion 3 delay every dlc already on ps4 for no reason if capcom think pc gamer is not important as ps4 gamer why we bother buy you game?fxxk re2 and dmc5
0;"""This isn't a review but just a heads up to anyone who's considering to get this for the multiplayer aspect of the game. Constant disconnects be it your own mission or someone else's. It's a joke that that you and your friends cannot progress together on missions that have cutscenes if you do want to join them you have to complete the mission prior to actually being able to """"co op"""" with them. What is the point of it in this case?"""
0;Monster Hunter World Developers you have to make things right for the multiplayer feature you're making us cringe because of the occasional disconnetions it ruin the games of most of us especially during quests where more players are needed. We are not happy about this issue. Perhaps more will come and enjoy if you can fix this. Please focus more on your problems carefully as this is not a cheap paid game. Thank you
0;i waste my money on this... I really hope i can get a refund... You see the game itself is great.. But the connection are terrible.. Now is a winter fest and because of the stupid error code something something i never actually get a chance to play it.. Write a number of e mail to capcom none response.. FML.
0;Seemed very repetitive. Killing a ton of bosses seemed like a pretty cool concept buts its all the same after a while and that's not counting the rehashing of mission with the same bosses and reskinning of the same bosses and giving them different names. Drop aren't even that worthwhile. Sure you should always upgrade your gear but they don't seem to make too much of a difference. You can run through a good portion of missions until you actually need to get new gear.
0;I have been play Monster hunter for a longtime about 3000 hr. Pro Good CG compare to same series Seemless map Con Not good CG compare to 2018 other game Use too much CPU GPU Game too easy for Old player Less Weapon Less customizeAnd Varyyyyyyyy Bad Multiplayer always fail connection and error nearly all the time
0;I am personnally totally disappointed by the rate of updates and the Capcom who ate their promise currently I don't recommend any attempt to purchase PC version and even more any version of Monster Hunter World until Capcom keep their promise and do some actual work on this game.
0;They had over a year to port this game to PC and they bring this. The game looks really bad textures are bad even on High and I have to play with black bars because no 21 9 support.. in 2018. I have a lot of japan console ports but no doubt this is the worst one.
0;*sigh* I guess I have to put out my review on the disconnecting issue. The game is beautiful don't get me wrong. The only issue that disrupts the fun of it all is the constant disconnects ruining the experience because there is no way to go back into the instance. The scaling for the monster even persists and doesn't compensate for the number of players on the field.I'm holding this review as a negative until this is fixed. The game is fine otherwise.
0;Don't waste your moneyThe gameplay is awful. The controls are super unresponsive making the combat unplayable. Graphics are years behind other games. Multiplayer function is basically non existant due to disconnection problem.Bunch of bugs and broken game machenics that Capcom continues to ignore. Overall just an all hype this game is a joke. The negative reviews are true. Save your self the money and frustration.
0;Kill monster get parts upgrade gear. Kill monster get parts upgrade gear. Over and over and over....Kinda like d3. Then once you complete the story mode you kill monsters that look just like the ones you just killed but colored differently. Ugh....If the game didn't start out with a long story and more time in to playing right off the get go I wouldn't have wasted 60.00 dollars on this repetitive game.
0;Love this game and series overall. However the recent Kulve Taroth update has been annoying. I'm not annoyed by the RNG but I'm annoyed by the poor optimization of this game. Before the update I been running this game very decently. Now I get random black stutters mid game which is a huge eyesore. Please optimize your game Capcom...
0;"""Its ok but in comparison to some others it's story is shortlived and it just becomes* constant hunting.There was no real feel put into this game. For a """"New"""" world it's small messy and the AI is horrendous.Feels like a step down from even the PSP releases and for a PC first? I'm kind of let down when Monster Hunter Online was supposed to be International and instead capcom releases this.No long supporting capcom over this and their awful PR."""
0;Nearly three months after the PC release the devs have yet to address the glaring issues re the game defaulting to the low resolution textures lack of ultrawide support etc. With each new monster release on the PC it becomes less and less likely the devs will actually address the glaring issues in the PC version.
0;Before the game released on steam it's said that the PC version will keep pace with PS4. And now PC version is far hehind PS4 and we have to wait for Kulve Taroth until early November? Why do we have to wait more time for existed content? Great job Crapcom. My friends and me AFK because there is no content to play with.This is my only negative review on steam. and I'll change it to positive if Crapcom updates PC version slightly more frequently for existed content.
0;Bought this game after the long hype of it coming to PC port.I would love to give this game a thumbs up but sadly not yet as I have yet to play with friends in my history of almost 20 hours.So many different connection errors and all were there when it was released half a year ago for PS4 and XBox.Please care for the people who back you guys up and fix this error before you lose your backers
0;the game is need more update...dont understand why you need to monster to constantly following each other literally every second and flying monster need to stop flying literally every 10 mins hope the game fix its problems soon other then that the game is bloody good
0;This game has some of the worst connection problems I have ever seen in a multi player game. I have been unable to play with my friends for two weeks now. and we're almost 5 months post PC launch. same error every single time. and literally no communication from Capcom on the issue. If I hadnt enjoyed every other aspect of this game I would have refunded it immediately. but dont reward these people with your money.
0;This game is awesome but all the issues just makes it unplayable. Everytime I plug in my controller to play it either freezes or just doesn't even detect my xontroller. Also there is fps issues I get really low fps for no reason. I would recommend this game but not right now until they fix the issues then it's a reccomend.
0;Half a year to not things up and Capcom still manages to ruin it. Cpu manages everything in game while the Gpu sits and eats glue which leads to tons of crashes. Connection issues only make it worse for getting anything done with firends. This cake is also topped with a nice little Denuvo cherry.
0;Not recommended as a totally now player to Monster Hunter. It's way to unfriendly to keyboard users. The UX feels like they come from 90s. They put World in its name not players interaction n bonding is weak. Simulating real life failing from such perspective.
0;This game runs poorly on my i5 4440 gtx 1060 6gb 8gb ram. FPS frequently drops down to 10 20 fps on high setting at 1080p with Volumetric Rendering off. Not to mention constant coop connection errors. To think they needed six months for this lazy port! Way to milk off pc players!
0;I can't recommend this game for PC as it is clearly made for console and little was done to make it PC friendly. If you own a console then yes this game should be fun but as a PC player it's very frustrating that the Dev's couldn't be bothered to make a UI for PC players. How hard can it be to make a drag and drop task bar WOW Ark Rust ETC. but no these guys just left you with console radial wheels and nonsense controls. it makes the game impossible to recommend to friends.
0;Cant connect to anyone for the last 3 months waist of money if u cant even play the game with friends have tryed every so called fix and nothing works. can be online for about 3 min then error code pops up anoiying not being able to play the game u bought .
0;"""Black screen on start up requires me to restart computer to runor Takes 10 minutes to finally bootHow the do you delay releasing this game for months to make sure """"PC version of the game runs smoothly"""" and for this to still happen? HAHAH you capcom."""
0;"""Thats the new lvl of servers and lazyness of japs. U wanna play this game with ur friends or with bunch of randoms? Heheheh glorious weebs servers will not allow u to do this. Oh and also u will annoy people in ur steam friendlist with """" Username IS NOW PLAYING MONSTER HUNTER"""""""
0;Really trying to enjoy this game but I can't even make it to the main menu. Crashes on boot every time. I'll gladly write a better review once I can play this game because I REALLY want to play it. But for now I can't recommend spending money on a game you have to gamble on working.
0;After played awhile I would say I like this game but some of the bugs crashes disconnects too much RNG and the end game which recycle the content again and again are making this game a love and hate situation. I felt capcom are simply not done enough to improve. So I will give a thumbs down until they can fix the end game problem.
0;Way too difficult to control for a game. I like challenges but the controls for this on CPU are stupid. It's not even rewarding. If you like farming one monster for hours to get a gem to upgrade one weapon/ piece of armor to use against two monsters cool. F*ck you if you like solo play though! Once you get to the Elder Dragons you can kiss any sort of fun goodbye. It's a chore...
0;7 month of waiting to deliver this garbage.The game is awesome the porting and more important the server (which was the MAIN reason so to speak while Capcom delayed the game on PC) sucks hard.In its current state I wouldn't definitively reccomend this game and SURELY it doesn't worth anywhere near the 60 bucks these greedy bastards ask.
0;Amazing game but just don't buy this version buy ps4 version instead.300 hours into this game all achievements done. However post game grinding is nothing new. DLC/ update will never catch up to console version new monster/gear kept coming out onto console for us PC players to 'look forward to'. Gameplay is amazing. Exactly a monster hunter game you will ever want but just buy PS4 version for the complete game experience.
0;I enjoy the game a lot but it has serious flaws in multiplayer. The scaling is done poorly and can only scale up. A lot of people leave mid fight when they die once leaving you to battle a scaled up steroid monster alone. Not to mention the trolls who run in just to die a couple of times so everyone gets their 'quest failed' and can try again from scratch. The rest of the game is truly amazing imo. I just can't recommend a $60 multiplayer game with major design flaws in multiplayer...
0;THIS GAME IS AIDS. THIS GAME HAS HAD MY GRAFICS DRIVERS ROLLED BACK TO 3 UPDATES AGO 3 3RD PARTY SOFTWERE SYSTEMS JUST TO GET 30 FRAMES!? THE KEYBORD CONTROLS ARE CLUNCKY AND MADE BY SOME ONE WHO HAD NEVER TUCHED A COMPUTER IN THERE LIFE!!! AFTER ALMOST 200 HOURS OF TELLING MY SELF ITS GOING TO GET BETTER ITS GOING TO GET BETTER ITS GOING TO GET BETTER im done save your money... waited 8 more months longer then consle players and capcom gives a port that runs worse then the dark souls port.
0;Please CapcomI gave you my moneyPatch your god damned gameThose hitboxes are the LAMEST I SAW IN YEARS. Last time I had to deal with such a bad collision system was in another Monster Hunter game but the game engine used back then was really old so I didn't mind that much. We're in 2019 now you can't possibly sell a game which is meant to be skill based where ennemies can damage you by charging FORWARD even if you're BEHIND THEM.If it wasn't for the collisions the game is great.THANKS XOXOXO
0;Very bad port of the game. Hit boxes are not accurate. Control response is extremely hit or miss mostly miss. Be prepared to experience many MANY cheap deaths. It's too bad. There's a lot of potential if only they could clean up the code which they won't. Maybe a remastered version some time in the future? Thumbs way down until then.
0;This game was fun at the beginning but later on is completely ts. Every monster is just so damn strong and they can one shot you no matter how much defence you have (unless is 1000). Our hard farming armors are so useless when fighting those tempered monsters specially devi jho. Its attacks are automatically one shot. Fun game huh.
0;"""""""Oh wow multiplayer!"""" Throughout the week Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error .And the number of times i have ing crash in this game is just WOW. Best and worst $85 i have ever spent on Steam."""
0;I really liked this game until yesterday where I lost my entire save game because of a bug with the save game (and no it's not the xeno thing with the media creation tools!!). 89 hours wasted for a HR34 char. I hope there will be a fix in the future then I can recommend the game for sure. But right now I can only recommend to play this game with a daily backup of the save game.
0;Its a great start to the Monster Hunter series especially for PC.The problem is that its gets very repetitive end game and the arch tempered monsters are just the same with more HP/Dmg.The DLC release has gotten better though!The game needs more variety.
0;Game is good port is possibly the worst in history. It runs poorly on a moderate gaming set up and decent on a high end one. However wtf is with having a port with half of the game's content missing. The event on PC are a joke compared to console even though we all paid the same price. I'm
0;Good game but denuvo. Denuvo will always kill performance for NOTHING seriosly tho if your specs are good enough and you can survive some buggyness this is a pretty fun boss rush games got to 7 stars solo...it'd be more fun with friends thoNeither of these links are to the study but they talk about it.https //www.neowin.net/news/eu paid for then suppressed study that says piracy doesnt harm saleshttps //gizmodo.com/the eu suppressed a 300 page study that found piracy do 1818629537

0;bad game it has lost all the spirit of hunting monster its all about making equipment for yourself now.when you see a monster you dont have the feeling used to be the monster are nothing now but a scared little prey.lack of feeling of impact multilateral cooperation balancees sense of purpose. (which used to have in PSP)Loud and bad background music.this game has turn from a 75% hunting experience to a machine that hook on your desires. (or should i say an onlineRPG)?
0;fun and great game but keeps crashing after the kulve update so unless its fixed then i would not recommentd i was so excited when i heard that kulve is coming but just to have the game crash everytime while im loading into the mission is extremely dissapointing.
0;Jesus Capcom have no idea how to run a game on PC.Thousands of new games with their fanstastic game content comes up every week on this platform. It is not your little PS4 CapcomAnd there are couple of bug fix to be called 'The second' instead of NEW WEAPON AND ARMOR SETIt is really necessary to keep the loyal player group with you Capcom. Respect the PC player WHY HOLD THE KEY PART IN YOUR HAND WHEN PLAYERS ARE THIRSTY TO PLAY FOR NEW WEAPON AND ARMOR???? GET FXXKED!
0;after playing 160++ hoursmultiplayer barely functions and when it does you dc in like 10 mins leaving you with a monster that has the hp multiplier and alone.end game farming is 100% RNG. decoration farming is 1000000% based on luckmy recommendation is borrow the game from a friend. not worth the money for essentially a single player game
0;Product received for free. The game should not be played in PC.the company made this for waste our money.This game has a bad conection bad control bad server.Cause you hundred hour of time and pay baack nothing.I highly NOT recommand to all of you guys to play this suck game. this company the server you To the idiot game creator.
0;Grindy trash.Badly paced punitive move sets unpredictable hit boxes scores of enemy moves that interrupt and stun items that don't do what the game tells you they do debuffs that affect you despite immunity and bosses that you can't kill in 50 minutes you can't generate the damage to kill them despite an hour of hunting with the most powerful available weapons.After 120 hours I have had enough frustration.And this is the BEST the franchise has to offer.
0;"""(if HAVE Just wanted to ask if it is possible to have 2 4 ps4s and 3DS (already contacted to the internet) in the same house))Its called LAN (local area network) and it uses Ethernet cables to link directly among each linked source in the network to create a private sessionSo the question is """"does MHW support LAN?""""The answer is probably NO"""
0;if you like spending more time chasing a fight than actually fighting the monster this game is for you.if you like a game to be absolutely lacking in any sense of balance this game is for you.if you want to be in the absolute best gear/setup for the exact fight youre doing but you still want to be one shot at any time from unavoidable damage.... this game is for you.if you like having the other players get dropped from the game EVERY SINGLE MISSION.....
0;Product received for free. I seem to remember paying for Monster Hunter Content not Final Fantasy. I'm honestly dissapointed with this cash grab to get the already chronically anoyying Final Fantasy fan base involved in Monster Hunter. Please Capcom use the money we paid for the game and fix the overwhelming amount of connection issues!
0;This is so stupid ...they put one fuc*in stupid monster in it and it totaly frustrates you no fun at all ruins gameplay and you cant ignor it cos you need parts from it ... missions doesnt appear for that monster. This is my exp. from this game. Not mention convert from Console ...
0;21 9. Capcom ! Seriously ! I have games from 2012 that support this. Get with the program. Ultra wide is fairly common place on high end gaming systems now. Patch this up please. Get with the program. This is a simple issue and a major F up.At this point I can't recommend the game. If there is this simple of a screw up I can't immagine what is waiting for me as we move further into the game. FIX FIX FIX FIX. Get on the 21 9 Capcom. For the love of GOD !!!
0;this game is so so stupid it makes no sense to me. why you need to try so hard to beat the buggy monsters and maps.and the biggest problem is why the monster is getting so much stronger but you. it makes me want to kill myself.i think all this game about is wasting time
0;only good graphics.character status cant increase slow movement. almost instant deatch if meet fast monster like tobi kadachi or nergigante. and damage is not constant sometimes very small damage sometimes isntant death even you have good armor.decent gameplay and often disconnect.
0;Beautiful immersive PC game that tantalizes you with the promise of fast action and intricate choreography then slaps you in the with an unusable PC interface. See that 1/4 second opening and know exactly what to do wtih it? Great now try to hit the 7 keystrokes with animated menu delays required to pull it off before the window closes. If it can't be played effectively with a keyboard and mouse it doesn't belong in the PC library.
0;If u want too play for a good maybe 10 hour before hit Negriante then have fun. BUT if u want to get stuck forever keep play after reach the Negriante fight. I have been stuck on this STUPID idiot for since I have been at the mission. I claw and peck my way too him low health still.... One shot. Fly up slam I die. One shot. After hours of mining ores collecting materials I still can not ever kill not a ONE time....
0;Ower Hyped t I don't understad why all the positive reviews on youtube.They just make you fight with T rex in a very small space i'ts not fun just anoyng. The grind in this game is sheet fight a monster for 30 min only to get fainted by the bullsheet one it K.O the fight him again. DONT BUY save your money
0;Don't Buy this game if you dont want to waste your time and money this game is t .. Teostra so OP ing mother er to much damage even thou u have fire Reses. and a High rank 90 up.. Just Don't buy this game .. This Game is a TRASH no HP bar the enemy Plus high Damage even u just Kick hafl of your Hp is Gone Stupid
0;Bugged textures graphical details like stars missing in the night sky and water reflections bugged. Capcom has yet to even acknowledge these listed graphical issues. The game is also a trash port that can't even reach parity graphical setting to the console version. Game also doesn't receive the content updates console get no summer events no autumn/holloween events. Seems the pc version was released just to be released.
0;They need to fix the server issue ASAP can't believe publishing game in this conditionwe all diss other game companies for bad coding and quality but this is like giving you great game with broken key functionwhich make you evem more angry because the game is great
0;Although the game is great the multiplayer has been a very big letdown. I have logged well over 266 hours between PC and PS4 so I do enjoy the game immensely. If capcom can fix connectivity issues with the game I would be glad too revert my negative review but its safe too say stay away until they fix the connectivity issues if multiplayer is the only thing you are looking towards
0;I love the game and concept but for how high profile it is it makes some of the weirdest decisions in how it wants to do things. The things that bothered me most were the inability to map my controller as it decided keeping things from the PS4 was not what it wanted and so changed some from there or that it even tells me what buttons to press on my dualshock.
0;Product received for free. After you see the 20ish actual monsters then its pretty damn boring. The usual MH has about 90. After you hit HR 100 theres nothing after that and you've already seen all the fights and they're kinda eh. It's got good match connection now which I guess is great but other than that its not all that fun. The only thing post HR100 to do is to finish a build or get more decorations but like I said its pretty damn boring after you've fought all the monsters a couple times.
0;pro fun gameplay and mechanics story was good. con felt really bored after end game keep farming for decorations and gems non stop connection issues still happen despite months after game release.too less monster extra bored fighting the same one over n over again
0;Horrible connectionDisconnected so many times and screwed up the fun and mission totallyBut since the patch released it's fixed 90%. So I will change my review.But lately I have experienced very bad connection and unable to find rooms even full of players. I am gonna stick with bad review.
0;do not purchase before the new patch comes out unless you plan to play soloas it is a lot of people are having connection issues very hard to connect to sessions and when you do there is a high chance you will disconnect in the middle of a quest. i suggest waiting until they tackle these issues
0;New player here almost played for 2 days a row... pretty enjoying because of the graphics sceneries etc. but one thing I hated the most is when I played to hunt/capture different bosses for hours then I started to save (3 times always + 1 save before Iogging out my account)... but the frustating part is when my account still going back to the start when I need to start hunting again those monsters that I already killed. Furthermore Fix the connectivity issues.
0;shts bunk but funseveral graphical issues idk why but when i have vsync off or unlimited fps i get this gross line across my screen hence why i have vsync on now at 60 fps (frame drops in elder recess though)connection errors every now and then most friends dc because of alt tabbingalso needs more sisterly fourths and fish aficianados like come on guys
0;"""Poor port cant rebind all keys doesnt support ultrawide resolutions Trying to play with friends makes you pull out your hair.""""Hunt alone or in co op with up to three other players"""" Maybe if the quest doesnt involve a cut scene or the game just doesnt want you to.Get it on sale if at all."""
0;Runs flawlessly on max settings.Console port so bring your controller along.Great music vibrant world. dlc on day one had to enable controller through big picture for it to work (and bp is horrible) so many d/c when trying to play coop ruins the coop play
0;The connection issues are pure cancer couldnt play a single session with my 3 other friends with at least one person disconnecting. All my friends and i bought this game to work together and this is what we get in return. Singleplayer gets boring after awhile so please Capcom fix this issue ASAP.
0;PLS fix miltiplayer network issue ! Always kept disconnect when playing with my friends and thats not my network problem i can literally play other games hours and hours without disconnect . MHW accept one quest then disconnect within 10 minits . GREAT GAME
0;As a game it is rather polished and definitely worth the money.However I bought this game for a multiplayer experience and disconnecting every 10 minutes is simply horrible regardless of the gameplay.If you are buying this for a single player experience its definitely worth your buck but if you are looking for a multiplayer one wait for a real fix to be deployed.
0;the game itself is awesome. But as a multiplayer kinda guy MHW's server errors are unacceptable. Don't even try guys u might get lucky for 1 2 games a day during non busy hours but its not worth the fustration. wait a month or just totally forget about this game.
0;Looks great runs great.It's Monster Hunter.EDIT While the above is still true. It's been 10 days and the multiplayer isn't fixed. And worse than that there's been next to no communication from Capcom about it.Great game be half the draw is being able to play with friend which is next to impossible in the game's currentl state.I'll recommend it when the game is fully playable again.
0;At the current state of this game I do no recommend this game. While the game is fun and the mechanic of the fighting is amazing the constant connection issue is really dissapointing. Getting dropped from a game when you almost kill a monster is really annoying and heartbreaking. CAPCOM needs to build new servers and they should have anticipated the wave of PC players. The fact that they didn't build new servers to handle the amount of traffic generated by PC players shows that they don't care.
0;Constant disconnects cannot do story missions with people who are in the same spot in the story. Pretends to be a multiplayer game is actually single player. DO NOT BUY. I strongly recommend never buying this game. I also strongly recommend Capcom employees to go to work and do their jobs.
0;Review updated to 31/08/18the game would be an 8.5 multiplayer works the game lasts for about 100 hours at least it's fun to hunt alone or with mates but the technical side of this game still presents plenty of problems graphical lacks compared to console version make this port worse than the original one.
0;the game is great however there is currently connection issues and the port is lacking and needs work for example theres no option to disable motion blur Depth of field or to adjust the voice chat volume and the mouse control is horrible so wait and see if the port gets improved will update to recommended if that happens.
0;I will update when they fix their bugs. If you want to play this with other people wait.Constant disconnects in the middle of doing anything.I also find not being able to do story quests together with friends until halfway through each quest extremely annoying and unnecessary.

0;GREAT GAME BUT..FIX ONLINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! or this game will die like others like it!!!update.... 8/23/2018new update was installed.. and OMFG made it much worse... before at least i could join SoS and have ppl join me.. now NOTHING WORKS.. THIS GAME!!!!! Capcom you.. get ur head out of your and fix the game... U OWE THIS TO US for having to wait this long for a game.. that might as well be alpha.... FIX THE GAME!!!!!
0;great game horrible DC (dc varies but its really awful dc non stop ) constantly RUINING experience NOT WORTH MONEY TILL They fix the issue or else you will be purchasing a game you can NOT play with FRIENDS and only waste your time disconnecting horribly. Note portforwarding doesnt work ! dont waste yopur time or effort only to discover it !
0;Game is running much better than my expectation with i5 3470 and GTX 1060. Good graphic and frame rate. Game content is soild. However i could not give it a possitive review until they fix the multiplay connection issue. I did not expect myself playing this game alone.
0;This game IS NOT fun for playing with friends. The multiplayer is a COMPLETE mess. All of these glowing reviews never mention this which leads me to believe they paid for all these great reviews.The gameplay itself is quite fun and the mechanics are good (though keyboard/mouse gameplay is super clunky) but this game is essentially a single player experience that you can grind with friends after for gear improvements.No thanks going to refund.
0;Great game but jesus christ the multiplayer is a disaster. capcom really screwed the pooch with this. Im on the same mission seen all the cutscenes (you cant play with friends if one has not seen all cutscenes in a quest which is ) and i still cannot play even after it said i am able to play multiplayer. also lock on system is absolute trash dont use it.
0;This game started out great fast updates fixing issues and weapon balance was great. In the last few weeks I find myself getting two tapped after unloading 7 or 8 shots into someones chest. I don't know if its Desync or what but servers need to be upgraded. Even for an early access game I can't recommend it in its current form perhaps a few months of updates will fix the issues.Edit 1 Also optimization seems to be going backwards in terms of performance for some.
0;Unable to remove depth of field or motion blur no 21 9 support. Same poor textures as on PS4 Volume Rendering is useless.The controller issues crashes the lack of PC UI the FAKE MOUSE support the black bars even on some 1080p monitors the way it stops many CPUs from even running the game the audio sync issues the missing DLC for many deluxe owners there are tons of legit issues.Over 6 month and Capcom release a hearthless console port. At the current state i can't recommend MHW to buy.
0;if you wish you wanna play this game with your friend just forgot this game atm. this game keep repeat kick me and my friend out of the match session like everytime or 9 time of 10 match. and it's just make this game really worth nightmare for newbie cos the boss getting stronger when u play with 2 or more people in your team and then everyone dissappear leave you alone with is mean unfair fight for newbie. Not recomment multiplayer looking till CAPCOM fix this.
0;Been playing for sometime the disconnection issues is really annoying and pretty unacceptable for a triple A title like this especially with no fix a week after launch gameplay wise its a really fun game and looking foward to all the issues getting fixed.
0;70 hours. Gone. I love this game I've loved all the MH games but for the LOVE OF GOD DO NOT beat the final boss. It has a chance to corrupt your save and just render it useless. And for that I cannot suggest this game with it being out for a week with no fix.
0;Game itself is well designed and developed but I can't recommend this game now.There are fatal network errors that most players can't play multi play.Players got only 1 update after 2 weeks pain and it never fixed the issue.I understand all the softwares always have bugs and I'm generous to bugs but CAPCOM IS LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY.
0;I still can't find people after the patch 280k people in the game and I fail to join Matchmaking sessions then finding a session has 2 people 1 in each of their own session..There is 0 social aspect of the game and the chat window is annoying as hell to operate. This game has a lot of work to do before I would recommend it.
0;No 21 9 supportAncient multiplayer systemServer issuesBut we still need to be happy and glad that our japanese overlords are allowing us to play this game on PC.Buy only if you are a foreveralone otaku that has no friends because the multiplayer does not work.
0;With recent patch it seems the online session has improve getting less error message or been disconnect... Well it's better than nothing.*Edit And......no still having error 83 mw1 I take back what i said and hope they fix it real soon. Soloing at the moment.
0;Bought for PC can't get past character creation without a fatal error that exits out of game. Tried to launch from steam and then from GeForce Experience as well. Same thing happens both times. NEVER bought a game that wouldn't run past the first few minutes...
0;The game is great but the networking is ing trash don't buy that ing You'll get a nice party to do some boss and then the game upscale the monster and all your buddies are gonna get disconned one by one and the monster isn't getting downscale after they all leave. You're now left with an unbeatable that you won't be able to kill even in your dreams.Good game. Don't buy it for the multiplayer it's trash.
0;It's a single player game at this point. Matchmaking does not work SOS Flare does work but if the folks trying to help you DC you end up with a monster that got boosted ( 2.2x health ) to MP levels and you are alone with it.Capcom needs to fix the multiplayer disconnects ASAP.
0;The game online session is so bad that it keeps disconnected. Also when doing quest the connection is changed to P2P. Not many people have good connection and if the leader is disconnected so do everybody on the group. Monster Hunter is a big franchise and it can't even provide players with a dedicated server. It's a huge dissapointment. I cannot recommend this game because of this issue.
0;Is the game good? Definitely.Assuming it actually works.Single player is doable but the true game lies in its multiplayer which is basically non existant due to connection issues.Wait for them to either fix the connection issues or wait for a big sale to play this single player game.
0;Great game but god awful port. It's been 10 days since release that's 80 work hours and Capcom hasn't done jack about the connection errors. They've acknowledged it 3 separate times now but in 80 work hours have done absolutely nothing. That is 100% unacceptable for a dev team that has hundreds of employees. Do NOT buy or support this game until it is fixed.
0;Network issues on a game that took 8 additional months to be released on this platform. That is unacceptable. If it has anything to do with the Denuvo DRM that has been known to be total #### then once again capcom has shown their craptasticly bad ability to produce a proper port. Don't buy until Network features are actually fixed.
0;Ok so this port is pretty bad crashes twice on me forced me to hard reset on both times. Fps droppage if it drops in cutscenes it desycn it to the point your cutscenes will be playing behind the audio. As if right now this game is in a unplayable mess.
0;love this game but the multiplayer is freaking bad broken everytime cannot play a decent game with my pals for more than 30 mins you guys have 6 months to improve this game and this is what you bring us feaking rip off fix it or it will be another no man's sky death game
0;After three days (25 hours playing time) I can already see this is going to be an awesome game EXCEPT the multiplayer is broken. I would love to recommend this game but because of the multiplayer and the hefty pricetag I'd much rather point them towards something like Warframe which is free... I really expected this game to be working like it should from day one.
0;At the moment no don't buy it until Capcom fixes the game. 8/29/18 The multiplayer works now tho Improve these Mouse acceleration Motion blur/bloom deactivation Allow extremely FULL modular keybinding. Make co op actually doable without watching a cutscene.
0;It took them more than half a year to make this port???I have a few gripes that could be fixed otherwise a solid game experience to the core but for the love of god fix the framerate and the ugly fur textures and give more graphics options along with 21 9 support this is 2018 thanks poogie.
0;Came back just to change the review. The amount of bugs still present is appauling. One of the major being FPS despite high end graphics cards even on the lowest of settings. During specific fights it'll freeze before the monster even attacks then cut to the fainted screen. Been tested on multiple computers.
0;Rarely do I leave reviews even rarer are they bad. The online portion is so broken its near impossible to use. To be honest even if it worked perfectly it seems like multiplayer gameplay was more of an after thought than planned out. If you are planning on getting this with a freind and leveling together look for a different game.
0;This game is great until you've experienced all the monsters and weapons to play with after that it turns into an even worse grind fest then it started as. There's not even a point to grinding at end game unless you feel like getting the perfect setup which is pointless cause you're already able to kill everything you're just grinding to make grinding easier. Pointless.
0;Please repair the network connection while playing sometimes the network connection is lost. but when playing other games network connections look good there are no problems on the internet why if you play monster hunter you have to break up from the internet. that's all I have a problem
0;this game is so fun and really good but the problem for this game only in the network connection !!steam need to fix this or people will go away from this game one by one..i have 10 friends buy this game then 8 from them refund this game because connection issue ' ')and still the connection still noob right now after lunastra update!!
0;It's fun and game until your connection become unstable and you have to face ing nergigante all alone. I don't know whether my connection or the game server is bad and that makes me desperate when doing multiplayer. The worst ing server i've ever played
0;Every Single Update ! Every Weekends ! 50382 / 5098 / 201 FULL OF DC ERROR CODE so many negative commend on each time issue happens and capcom hv no intension to solve or improve the issue at all repeating mistake cant be forgiven !Therefore i hereby giving a negative commend and not going to change this commend forever no more chances given u deserve a negative commend !
0;The servers can't even keep 4 people in the same session or game for more than 5 minutes anymore. It's been happening for an entire month with people dcing halfway through quests constantly. Enough is enough.Don't buy this game unless you intend to play solo.
0;I cannot recommend a game that is bloated with anti piracy enough to force someone to buy an SSD to play it. An update came that will not let me get past the logos and neither steam nor capcom will offer support.Capcom will not issue a refund and neither will steam.If you want this game pirate it capcom is not worth supporting.
0;Firstly the load to get on a map or make a server takes almost an hour second the game constantly is slow and freezes on me and third everytime i play for a while or even a few minutes the game freezes my entire computer making me haft to restart it. And I even tested this without addons or really anything in that matter this always happens to me.
0;Now I know what makes this game funnier MODS. Your wondering why I said not recommended for this game is not the gameplay it s not the building cosmetics and it s definitely not the graphics it s because this is the one version of the game you can beat in about a week if you don t have mods enable
0;The Game would be amazing without so many bugs. There has been a problem with saved games your money being stolen to a negative number and cant go back to positive unproportionate amount of oils just to name a few.To have bought this for 105 CAD im a bit disappointed.
0;It's been said before the AI sucks.This game is awesome in about every way and has added new features that do lend to great emersion. However the AI doesn't understand how to build and manager units on a the map during war or peace. I strongly suggest waiting to buy the game in hopes they release a patch to resolve the issue. Otherwise I think this game will have zero replay ability. I just thank god I've got some great alternatives to play to keep my mind off of this horrible experience.
0;I thought the AI was one of the worst parts of Civ 5 and I'm honestly shocked to see that it got even worse. AI makes the game boring and frustrating to play with no intellegence to speak of. Difficulty increase just buffs their production and other stuff making the game even more frustrating. Really dissapointing it just isnt fun to play. The game has been out for a week and I'm already desperate for them to make a big update.
0;Civilization is a great game but VI is not. I don't know why 2k can public such a game which contains so many bugs. stupid AI system unmatched Technology development speed embarrassed City state...... If u want to win the game please choose Aztec and attack every other player(or AI) at the first time...battle battle battle and u will find that u win zhe game in 300 BC!!! So fun the game is!!!! Excuse me??zhe game is Civ or Red Alert??
0;Short simple sypnosis. Gameplay mechanics new ideas are great and well implemented. The only problem is I don't use any of these due to fast tech unlock by eureka. Industrial Age by 1000 AC in King difficulty....Wait for expansion GOY on sale or when they fix this issue.Extra stuff Build order slingers &gt archers &gt warriors &gt nuke &gt nuke &gt easy win.
0;Cross platform multiplayer is not working. They advised it may not work for short periods of time between patches but the studio now says there will be no cross platform multiplayer for another 50 days. It's a real shame. Spent a lot on two copies especially to play with my fiance which now I can't do.
0;The gameplay is good but the build quality and testing is horrible. The ability to load a saved game does not work and the fix is egregious. This is the kind of thing they should have caught in testing based on the numbers of people experiencing the problem. Cannot recommend a game released in this state.
0;It's fun to build your empire.It's not fun to interact with the AI. The AI ist stupid in wars diplomacy and building it's empire.The AI should be one of the most important aspects of a civilization game.please Improve the AI Improve performance (turn times leader animation) improve mod support (most things are hardcoded) Make quality of live improvements (unit list)
0;Visually it's an appealing game. Full marks to Firaxis et al for that element. Game play on the other hand leaves a great deal to be desired. Between the irritating 'feature' of AI civs being clustered far too close to my founding city and the AI just plain cheating it's not worth the expense. If I could return it for a refund I would. Save your ducats and get Civ V instead.
0;This review is more about the feeling of the game rather than getting into the mechanics. It really isn't as charming as the previous Civs. The graphics and UI remind me more of a mobile game. Similar to what they did to The Sims 4. The district feature is a nice touch and I feel like Civ Leaders have more personality and weight to them. But at the end of the day as you'll read in many of these reviews it's just not quite living up to Civ 5's standards.
0;I find it obscene to put out a game that derives all its replayability from the different civs and then only putting 15 in.After a month you played them all and they dont even vary that much from each other. And on top they want money for the dlcs that realy should be for free. Just buy a paradox title.Eu4. Buy Eu4. Or if you want something more like civ. Maybe Endless legend? Just to see something new
0;The game even on the easiest setting just mows you over. It's not fun. There are stupid complexities introduced. Like builders can only be used three times. That's stupid. Game play is complicated and bugs and not worth $60. I've been successful talking three other people out of buying the game. They won't give me a refund so the best I can do is tell other people not to buy it.
0;Great game until my civilization became 'war weary' during peacetime. Then it kept getting worse. Peace for 100s of years! But my citizens were 'war weary' and thus unhappy and eventually revolting because they kept getting MORE weary of the war that did I mention? DIDN'T EXIST AND HADN'T EXISTED FOR 100s OF YEARS. Game broken. No until they fix this bug. Otherwise it's not much of an improvement on 5. So no even after they fix this bug at this price.
0;I used to be an avid Rocket League player but I've lost so much interest after the game moved towards keeping players hooked by prioritising gambling crates and premium passes. Meanwhile the game's servers player matchmaking bugs glitches and forgotten game modes continue to be neglected. Every time I launch the game (like twice a year at this point) there's always something new to unlock/buy and nothing to keep the core Rocket League experience fresh and entertaining.
0;Had recommended it before (back in 2016) but since then this game has gone downhill. Each update seems to break the game more. The servers are laggy and they keep putting paid content in it but won't fix the poor serversWill change it to recommend when they finally fix the servers
0;"""make this game freethis game is unplayable if you can't handle mentally deficient idiots who can't accept their mistakes and refuse to use their crippled brainpeople love to spam """"Okay."""" in chat to blame you because they are too self absorbed to realize they are ball chasing idiots who also have a responsibility to defend and not just dive their incopetent heads straight into the ballas long as people are idiots this game will be badyet i still play this stupid game"""
0;Sick and tired of playing on 150+ ping servers. When i bought the game dear developers consider yourselves we made an agreement (an ethical one). That agreement included some money and your service others did that too in my region. NOT JUST ONE COUNTRY If you haven't noticed that rent some servers with SOME of that money.
0;This game is completely ruined by Chinese hackers and bluehole's refusal to region lock China. There are multiple servers for a reason and yet bluehold cares more about their revenue from loot crates than anything else. Do not buy this game. It was fun before the Chinese invaded the NA servers with every cheat possible. Hopefully another developer creates a similar game and actually does something (anything) to prevent rampant hacking.
0;IN head game since they nerf the fact that you are playing with 12 years old kid saying at the beginning of the game I'M NOT PLAYING THIS ONE. i choose to forfeit and the option abandon is there. then i get banned for leaving a TEAMMATE in the ditch... right just in get it like it was in the first place ban people after the 3rd game of leaving abandonning for sake
0;Trash Ranking System Im plat and i always get paired with people who are trash at the game and I derank. Then its hard to get back up. If they fix their Ranking System the game would be better but right now its so broken. People who cant even arial Shouldnt be in Gold+
0;this game is wonderful if you can play with people. The matchmaking in normals is ing abhorrent. It has two modes get placed with people WAAAAY lower than you in skill against people WAAAAY higher than you in skill or the oposite. And every so often it gives you a decent game. Seriously this game's matchmaking psyonix fix your
0;"""Honestly if you are looking for a fun game with a good community.

0;"""I've put a ton of time into this game. Imagine League of Legends if there were even less consequences for your behavior. This game has one of the most toxic communities I've ever seen.

0;I love this game I love this game I love this game.BUT Don't put me into games where the team I am joining is down by 3 4 5 6 7 etc goals already. Much less five consecutive times. Nobodwy (that I know) wants to join a game like that. One goal down ok two perhaps but more than that? No way.I will change my rating as soon as this is fixed.
0;Rocket League is a solid game but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Toxic community aside Psyonix seem dead set on getting as much money as possible through constantly releasing new crates in quick succession to fund their esports community while not giving a single toss about the average player.
0;Great game up until a recent patch that automatically bans you for any swearing in the chat no matter what the context. Thanks for letting us know you were implementing this into the game and banning thousands of players. If swearing in the chat of a video game ruins your experience you simply shouldn't be playing games.
0;Garbage ing servers. Garbage ing demos. Garbage ing updates. Psyonix has been out for your money since crates and not really putting any effort into fixing the godamn goal posts or the laggy ing servers. Holy ing this game can be so trash. Oh and when different servers ( West Oceania etc..) join your game in ranked and they can hit every shot but they're lagging across the field and when you get close your PC wants to explode. All in all a good game
0;Positive Only fun to play when u play with Skilled FriendsNegative Toxic Community Players only ask for trading in Matches up to Platinum Enemys everytime like Diamond+ and own Team Bronze Matchmaking System is like CSGO as hell Psyonix doesnt care about the Players only looking for Money from Crates and Keys (again like cs) Report System doesnt work reports are like Steam Reports nosense.
0;Recently the game has seen quite a dip in quality. The community has gotten pretty toxic and the servers are pretty terrible. The ranking system has shown evidence of many boosted players that can't hang on their rank and then drag other people down. I don't really know about other games but the community for this one has declined a lot and that means a lot to me in a game.
0;Yeah nobody asked for microtransactions. I don't need another gamble simulator in my videogames. The way it was handled before was fine. Took one update and one stupid decision to make me drop one of the bests games out there currently.Shame on you guys.If you're into stupid online gamblin and silly hats that nobody ever will pay attention too this is your way to go now next to CSGO and TF2.
0;The ranking system in this game is just miserable. It can take up to 3 wins to rank up a divison and you can lose that division in 1 loss. Almost impossible to win sometimes because the game pairs you with lower levels or people who are worse than you and you win 2 games in a row but then the next 2 games after that you're the one thats worse than the other team. Its just a constant battle between ranks teammates and trying not to break your controller/keyboard.
0;Fix your god damn F***ing competitive rejoining my internet disconnected for 20seconds i tried rejoining again and it returned me to main menu 10 seconds later then internet fixed and there was no rejoin option again 15minute ban when partied with 2 of my friends. trash setup fix your crap psyonix!
0;banned for 24 hrs for responding to someone that instigated my friend and I intentionally. worth noting i didnt swear or engage in any hate speech whatsoeverdont buy unless youre prepared to censor yourself despite the toxic community that by a large margin pervades every facet of communicationgame is good. developers are babies. majority of playerbase is composed of incorrigible abominations of hate and sweaty palms.if youre a mute and cant type i very much recommend this game
0;I love this game and its so fun... but after this update it crashes all the time its so annoying and bad. Im so confused how you still have not fixed this bug yet its a new season i want a good rank and im just crashing every game i loose to ppl who should be silver because the crashing it has never been like this. I hope you look up my review and fix the game.
0;This game was the absolute I loved this game and played it competitively. But this new update has ruined the game. Before the update I was playing with a ping of 8. Now after the update I play with a wopping 268 ping. You can not play this game with a 268 ping and enjoy it.
0;Psyonix get your togheter.Don't get me wrong I like this game but since the new update theres a of lagg (never had lagg not even in very heavy games).FIX THE LAGGYou can't even play ranked 'cuz your car dissappears in the ground everything flashes around and you even miss the damn straight kickoff due this lagg.Really get you togheter and fix this.
0;To Be Honest This game is ed up Collision is done Wrong.You can clearly see the developer have no idea of Force.Dont buy it. Dont play it. Ask your money back.Until the game is rewriten it is not playable.The server allow people with over 200 ping.Higher Ping means extra time to react.
0;used to be a great game maybe thats just for console but now you can lag at 40 ping I have 1 gig internet speeds but rocket leagues tells me my internet sucks well i am saying if you wanna buy a game that does not do the neccesary upkeep on their servers then look no further rocket loeague is for you. I can play any other game no problem. for example destiny 2 fortnite crossout wow league of legends cod tekken. so why is it that this game lags out?
0;Win 3 in a row go up a division. Lose 1 go down a division. Win 2 in a row and don't go up a division. Lose another and go down another division. The ranking system on this game is absolutely terrible and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone till it gets fixed.
0;Do you like reliable servers? Do you want a lag free experience? If you answered yes to either of these questions then you've come to the wrong place! Don't get me wrong this game is fun but when you lag with good ping and it cost you a game multiple times it makes you want to punch your screen
0;rocket league is just another game where people rage out at you and blame you for thier mistakes an online game its fun with friends solo its like punching a turd slightly satisfying but now you have turd smeared on your knuckles if you have friends interested in the game play it if you dont dont spend the money the community is very toxic
0;They are banning for abusive chat for no reason i mean you cant just ban someone for 7 days just for flaming someone i mean no other game does this THIS GAMEI can't believe it.... if you arent going to play it only 1v1 or older than 9 dont buy it. If i could choose now i would get my money back.
0;Don't play this game unless you're playing with friends. Garbage ELO system and matchmaker. You'll be with/against the same 4 or 5 out of 6 people you played with in your previous match. Losing is weighted higher than winning so ranked is just a giant grind.
0;Im actually kinda sad that im giving the game up for the simple but massive reason that the cumminuty is actually the most toxic hateful community i have ever come across. The only other community i have to compare it to is the dota community... even that is pg rated compared to this community.Not only that but psyonix has done an absolutely horrendous job of keeping the servers maintained and free of server side lag. This is one of the most frequently laggy games ive ever played
0;Game is alot of fun but will off even the most chilled gamers when youre getting teammates or put up agains gods. The Scoring system is awful scored 5 goals in my last game and still got divisioned down... they need to fix it before i just drop this game because atm the scoring systim is cancer af.
0;"""This game was fun for a while. But then it got old when the ball would warp through me or the ball would """"wiggle"""" around me visibly and go right passed me. Servers have never been fixed they just keep raking it peoples money and putting out tournaments where people play on LAN and there aren't these issues."""
0;servers are trash ill randomly get 200 ping in my own region and an everlasting meter and box symbol flashing across my screen. everyone starts teleporting and you cant even control your own car.gotta love those people who rage in the first 10 seconds.
0;iest game ever im finally at veteran level skill and level and i just get paired with rookie and afk people and the other them always has premade expert legendary sometimes i even get to play against roketeer or something yellow wirtten season 3 grand champion wtf is this? or i just get a room with 400 ping fix ur
0;I'd like to give this game a 5 star review but I just can't until they fix the rubber banding issue. I'll be going to save a shot on goal and all of a sudden my car will be to the right of the ball and I'll miss and the other team will score. It really adds up and pisses me off. It makes this game unenjoyable and it literally happens multiple times a game. So until this issue is fixed I'm giving it a thumbs down.
0;Since the last update the game randomly crashes while playing ranked matches then when I boot it up to rejoin it says no reservation found followed by a 5 minute matchmaking ban because 'I left' a ranked match. Otherwise great game to muck around on when you don't have much time since they're only 5 minute matches and its pretty fun. Community is pretty hit and miss though lots of toxic people who will blame you for everything (even if you have the most points on your team).
0;Rocket Pass is a Joke. i buy 10 keys and if i want the whole bunch of rewards i have to cash again ... thanks for making it very achivable for everyone and not only the people that are just starting and cashing keys. seemse like they are running out of money. i want to refund the rocket pass and rocket league.
0;"""You should urgently fix banning for 15 min altough connection is lost without no reason while I am playing. Then you ask whether I would like to rejoin by saying that """"Your connection seems to be lost by accidentally"""". I say yes. And baaam. I cannot join the game again and am banned for 15 min. It is the dummest thing I have ever seen!"""
0;To be honest this game is pretty trash i have a high end computer and the preformance is bad. The servers are trash each time im in game my friend and i all ways getting high latency or latency Variation which allways triggers me.Pls do not buy this game its a en waste of money if you want to be pro at this game your wasting your life trying
0;Possibly one of the most rage enducing games i've ever played. The toxic players the fps lag the glitches and of course the people that quit after 1 goal is scored. The one positive of this game is how its always being updated. still wouldnt recommend it though.
0;"""Psyonix dont care about cheating allow Pathbots / AFK Bots and more.Dont write Topics they contain """"cheat"""" in title or u will be banned by a childmod.If u love profilimages they contain porn/childporn or anything else right place to be because psyonix give a sh about own ingame content.dont buy this game if u dont like above or better dont buy use steamfamily from friends."""
0;Do not download this for Mac until it comes out of beta. Updates are released without testing/caring how it impacts Mac. Frame rate is terrible and Steam Controller doesn't work.edit Yes. It is still in beta or at least that is the excuse given by steam. I wish it were just my mac but it's a common bug that many are still impacted by. Still not fixed.
0;Seems fun at first but then you discover things like physics being weird hitboxes being totally different size/shape than the actual cars... Also the ranking system is garbage. I have played like 1000 matches in solo standard with 56% win rate and stayed around low gold all time. Sometimes the game even demotes you after winning a game. Also trolls and griefers run rampant and never get banned. Don't buy this game if you are a competitive player.
0;Game itself is fun but the servers are very touchy for a good connection you can play with a 42 ping and have a worse connection than someone at 300+ ping and connection interrupted. Until Psyonix fixes the server problem and not just keep releasing new crates instead the game is hardly playable at higher levels
0;One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen. Crossplay is a terrible implementation for a competitive game. If you get a cooldown for leaving a ranked game you can't play unranked either. For someone with a lot of patience and a good temper recommended. For someone with a short temper who just wants to have fun and not experience bullying and nerve wracking bugs definitely not recommended.
0;I loved it.I played a lot.Then I realize that no matter how good you are or how long you play you still can loose against rookies. The game actually have a lot of bugs inside like ball bouncing on walls or cars which give very crazy angles. I thought it was a game of skills but it's just about luck 75% of time.Devs prefer to add more and more buyable contents. They stopped game fixes long time ago now.So I uninstalled
0;well ive just lost my 14 keys lab and all my painted breakouts for no reason i just logged in and saw my car had nothing on apart from my wheels and i check in my inventory and most of my items have just dissappered tbh this has caused me not to spend anymore money on this game unless this can be resolved thanks a lot rocket league.
0;Very good game and very balanced skill wise. Trash servers and very little community care. Psyonix likes money nor do they care about improving the overall quality of the game. If you are new buy it. Anybody who has played at least 300hrs knows that this game is just a cash cow.
0;"""&gt Connect to online game&gt Rocket League crashes for the 100th time this week&gt Restart Rocket League&gt """"Not connected to Rocket League servers""""&gt Hit yes 50 times&gt Banned for 10 minutes for abandoning game10/10 would get match making banned again"""
0;Nice game some bad servers Rocket League team lies to customers on forums and no changes happen even after acknowledging their mistakes. Because of that its a 1.5/5I would have given it 4/5 if it was not for the devs and staff actions along with some server performances.
0;I played the other game modes but Casual Snow Day was the only mode I really liked. It was removed and replaced with a ranked version and is now significantly less fun. Since it seems Casual Snow Day will not be coming back and I haven't played since I think it's time to uninstall this game and never come back.
0;This lootbox system must be a hoax. You pay a lot of money for this keys to get useless skins all the time. I mean you are not even able to deal with them. So why is it so hard to get nice items? This is a fckin joke. You make me never wanna pay again for lootboxes for real. I will never ever in my life buy a key again. This is just a waste of money.
0;Psyonix added lootboxes after the game got out of EA and still has not sorted its servers out. That aside the game is pleasant. The maps are dumbed down when compared to SARBPC which means that pretty much everything that comes out is a reskin of the base stadium. I completely forgot about rating this game earlier which is why this review does not add anything new to the table. Still I feel like I had to do it.
0;Impossible to start playing this pathetic pile of crap they call ranking will always put you up against people with 400 hours that you have no chance of defeating ..... RIP my 12 bucks at least i bought it from . EDIT AFTER 100H As of 15.11.2017 the ranking is still ed. *Start placement matches*9 out of 10 wins*Get placed in bronze 3 for some reason*Win 14 matches in a row*Finally hit silver*Lose 2 in a row*Instant deranking to bronze 2 div.2 Minecraft has better ranking system than this.
0;Getting banned from casual for leaving ranked is the most idiotic mechanic especially when you have to deal with immature children who throw the match for no reason. Stupid penalty for us when those idiots get no punishment whatsoever. move by Psyonix.
0;Report simulator 2k18 every pleb just reports people instead of playing and psyonix grants their wish of timing people out instead of creating a helpful tutorial or a level requirement before they play ranked. Worst match making since dota otherwise this is a fun game. Also whoever has the higher ping gets the upperhand to ghost through the game and break the physics.
0;"""Since this update online games have become unplayable. My ping is showm as 16 and I have so much lag that I got stuck in a game because whenever I hit the ball into the goal nothing happened (the ball got dark but there was no explosion and the goal was not credited). Great game horrible ping detection and lag. Also I play with every video setting on """"maximum performance"""" and with audio off. My CPU usage when I start playing is always 15% and it jumps to 80% when I am playing the game."""
0;Are we only focusing on cosmetics now? The quality of the game seems to decrease every update that comes out... We only care about skins not wins! After 1.2k hours I think I have to say this game is really not worth the time or money. It was fun at first but eventually the terrible MM and servers start to get to you. This game was fun in 2016/2017 now it's a joke.
0;to simply put it this game sucks eggs.the driving is so stupid you spend hundreds of hours and still suck why cant it be more like mario kart.i already spend $15usd to buy the dang game why are there skins? why have i bought the skins?stupid game buy overwatch and play lucio ball instead.3/10 only because im being generous
0;ing horrendous match making. 30k (PC) plus players and got put with the same players 5 times in a row. Also getting put in games that already ended or getting put in a game that already started and your team is losing is ing stupid. Match making ruins this game. 0/10 dont bother with this over hyped trash.
0;This game is great you will be having a great amount of fun playing it and its fun until u meet a player who ruins your game and u rage quit lol.but as of recently the huge amount of server issue Troll players slow matchmaking the game saying 0 Players in the game while matchmaking or saying i am not logged into steam what the hell!!!this is frustratingnow today i cannot even enter a game because of matchmaking issue ( Unable to contact matchmaking server trying again ... (error 68) )
0;Very hard to play this anymore i used to play while streaming this but now is just impossible to do that without streaming having 80 100 ping. Can't hit the ball is just teleporting and doing weird staff like doesn't even bounce of walls or cars it just teleports.
0;Recent updates have made this game nothing short of unstable. They're adding too much flare to what used to be a great game. All of these new fancy features add instability and poor performance.Have a 980 and i7 like me? Doesn't matter. Does your computer have absolutely 0 issues when you play any other game? None of the above matter. You will freeze get poor performance and crash often.Do not purchase until they fix these issues.
0;New update added a lovely new ban system that'll ban you if you say naughty words.In the meanwhile all of the jackarses who are ruining your game on purpose by playing against their own team because the poor matchmaking put them in a match way above their level then get to report you and beg other people to report you and you'll get banned either way.Maybe actually fix the cause of the toxic bs going on instead of treating the symptoms. Then this'll become a positive review.
0;If you feel like getting paired with mediocre players and constant losing because people refuse to work as a team download this game. If playing alongside trolls and ignorant children appeases you download this game. If horrible gamemakers and TOS is your dream to be involved with download this game. If team play and fun are what you looking for run away do not purchase this game.
0;rocket league is best game in world we want 1000 dollar back because I lost all to dumb Indian man. The dumb Indian man me and my uncle and made me very very sad. If I don t get my money back my mom will shut down every rocket league server ever. thanks BekezoMeade
0;It's a nice game but they ruin the game with every update.Everytime they add a new map they need to add a map a map that's very impossible to play and have fun..They added an option to like and dislike the maps.You dislike the maps that you don't want but surprise...you only plaay that map that you disliked and those new maps aree horrible..
0;Its just sad that the recent update make my game unplayable from its major increase in ping to over 300ms even on my region (SEA). Overall the game is very addicting but please fix the servers especially SEA or this game will eventually lose players in a short matter of time.
0;Reasons i dont reccommend Atrosious network optimisationPay2win Yes thats right most of the micro transaction cars have a better hitboxyou dont play with people your level in competitve (me and my friend both challenger 1 play with challenger 2s and 3s because idk whyWay too many micro transactionswhy do i still play this game? i dont know myself but it's like heroin i hate it but i also love it
0;All in all it's an awesome game BUT THE COMMUNITY IS TOXIC AND SALTY! Every match you got leaver or unfair player or infantils insulting the other players or even worse! Even if you report this players nothing happens. Psyonix Inc. is just interested in selling DLCs and the keys for the crates.
0;Fun gameplay. Everything else i pretty terrible. The servers suck big time constant rubber banding. Cannot use in game chat without squeakers telling you to uninstall the game. The best part is if your internet or power goes out or the game the bed you get banned from all matchmaking. Can't open in game loot crates without paying money. Micro transactions are a scourge on the gaming community. Not worth the money.
0;This game is terrible. Do you want to play without friends? good luck the community is complete If you so much as call a teammate out for being an (scoring on your own goal) the autoban system bans YOU for 24+ hours. Want to leave that game? The ban system will ban you. Basically disable chat and pray your teammates are good otherwise play with your friends or not at all because Psyonix is a piece of At least steam wont ban me for speaking my mind.
0;Alright game but very clear shown how money greedy the company is through releasing more and more crates even often now than before. Decent game but can be repetitive and boring alot of the time especially for lower leveled players that are stuck at the bottom left with the option of either carrying the team or always queuing with other you rely on.
0;"""What ever degenerate decided to allow this games competetive to have the map """"Neo tokyo"""" needs to be burned on a stake and eaten by feral rats. The amount of times if lost on this autistic retard map to peasants is uncountable. The lips on the side make me want to suffocate in my own anu s."""
0;The takes in the game are really unbalanced as you can purchase cars wwho are heavier with real money. Also i'm a veteran and keep getting matched vs legends/masters/experts. Although i lose the majority of these games i keep getting matched against them. There is literally 5k people in the queue at a time so dont tell me there's no veteran onlineA game which features a competitive game mode but then has no control of the ranking system is not a game that i can recommend
0;The game itself is awesome...but the online play is sooooooooooooooo glitchy. Either they have totally missed a bug that lets other people mess with your connection or their servers are just really really bad. Either way the gameplay is very different online and infinitely frustrating.
0;The gameplay is solid the matchmaking is what I would expect if Donald Trump screwed Helen Keller. The community for this game is the biggest piece of group on earth. They make the league of legends community look like human rights proponents. My recommendation if you get this game is to never play it online. There should be a way to turn the chat off so you don't have to see it on the screen.
0;Sorry but this game has bad team selecting and i play 39 games of comp 2v2 and evry game in a 29 game streak it was 2v1 thair shud be a 24 hr bad if you leave befour the game is over it makes the game no fun so untill this is fixed i donet recommend this game i am sorry
0;I recommend it but stilll if it was /5 its a 3/5 your ranking system is pure crap your matching system is pure crap how tf do you put an expert vs a rocketeer in ranked? physics for hitting the ball with your car should be improved so i hit the ball going 50m/s and it goes 5m/s? ever heard of newtons laws? rather than adding items how about you fix your base before.
0;Some of the most fun gameplay I've seen recently but the community is absolutely atrocious. Don't even think about joining a game and not muting everyone else in the game instantly unless you want to deal with people constantly on if not you then each other.
0;This games community is okay at times but then there is no ban system in place for people who use horrible slang. Was just called the N word over and over and told to go pick cotton by a player. I know all online games have children that play but if you do not punish these children your community is going to go toxic. Fix your ban system or watch your game go in to the trash can...
0;Stupid game with stupids lags. Sometime it's impossible to play because of those lags and if you quit for it ... you're MF***** banned from the game for 15 stupids minutes. I used to loved this game but now it suck. And if you have a problem with the game don't ever think about reach any support
0;"""Has the worst dumbest and most immature community ever.""""review the game not the community"""" eat a banana lol. The community is part of the game reporting toxic players barely makes a difference and if the game and the devs can't handle their community then it's a bad game.What a save!What a save!What a save!What a save!Player IWasBornAPro left*Enjoy the rest of the game with the worst AI known to men* lol"""
0;This Game might be good or even great but i can not play it. Because the fu***** developers dont tell any kind of ports that this game uses so i can forward these ones. Thousands play this game and still the developers do not give any information on the ports this is ridiculous. How can a game be this popular with such a bad service. And it is overpriced considering the content of this game 10 would be fair.
0;This game used to be a lot of fun until the last update in December caused me and a lot of other folks issues with using a controller. It's been about a month with no update/fix. Lots of folks talking about this in the forums. I hope Psyonix is listening. I'll update this review if its fixed in a reasonable amount of time.
0;The game itself is good. Review would be positive butthe DLC policy is cancer.EDIT Even years after its release technical problems that have been here for eternities still remain persistent and unfixed. Instead we get rocket passes and dozens of new items each patch.Thanks I guess
0;I only recommend it if you're planning to play this game with friends. Playing solo only makes me wanna quit playing.Ranked is complete trash unless you play with some friends or you get lucky with some good teammates...Community is toxic piece of crap. Get called out for everything and with the broken ranked system that matches noobs with better players only to derank yourself.Stay away from this game unless you have friends or don't play ranked at all.
0;The new content in the recent update is aweosme but the skill reset has made it really boring. Most games are a gross mismatch of level and skill which means either team wins by a huge margin. I used to love playing this every day but now most games are super frustrating or really easy.
0;Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie You can't hit . You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still .
0;I got banned becouse of swearing?? He started the fight first becouse I said I got it before him and hit the ball he got mad and started scoring own goal??? And I've got banned couse of some kid being a little crybaby and sweared back.Thanks RL now I cant enjoy a game couse of your matchmaking system by getting mates like that.
0;So after 700 hours and just about being done with the game because they have nothing new coming out that makes the game fun again they make a ban system that bans you for saying anything slightly negative and I get banned for 24 hours for saying 1 bad word. Good luck rocket league.
0;I love this game I REALLY do but the newest updates are mutually disliked by anyone I talk to within the community and myself understandably. Please don't buy this game at the moment. Let Psyonix know that not every change they make has to be accepted by anyone. Please don't buy that rocket pass stuff either. At least not while the XP/Level system is this much of an annoyance.
0;game rewards dog players i uninstalled because i lost 10 games straight and my teammates were all room 7 your game ing sucks you just lost a supporter you dumb s pull your head out of your and create game that allows people to get better and win other than get worse and win just ing unintelligent as you dumbass dinks fix the ing game
0;You get banned for leaving a casual game of rocket league which defeats the purpose of casual game play. Casual game play mean that you should be able to leave the game whenever you want and not get banned. Especially when you are playing with other players that are new to the game and are at a much lower skill level than you.
0;The game is alright to play with some friends but like most games not fun alone. The servers have continued to be bad with lots of crashing as well as lag during most games. The only thing to do offline is play vs easy bots since all difficulty level is the same. If you are going to buy the game I would wait for a under 5$ sale because it is a good time killer with a group of friends. Thought I would add in that matchmaking for the game still seems off lots of mismatches in most games.
0;It's good in the beginning but once you get your skills you only get teamed with the biggest noobs on the planet (and thats saying it nicely). Unless you're on a team with your friends you will lose and lose at this game due to you're ***************************************ing team mates.
0;Plain and simple the new micro update (banning system) did it for me. 600+ hours and I think now is the time to wave the white flag on this game. Maybe Psyonix have got a little too big for their boots? At the end of the day they've lost my custom by implimenting this little totalitarian update. Hey ho.P.S. I've had this account since 2004 and out of all my games I decided to comment on this bloody one. Strange days!!
0;The game is actually quite good but the Dev team likes to torment it's player base by adding in bad maps that the community doesn't like at all and they refuse to remove them from the rotation. Overall these awful maps have ruined my play experience enough to make we no longer want to play the game and so it is uninstalled. Well played Psionix ignoring the player base is always the way to go!
0;Game lags out. Alt F4 doesn't work. Open task manager to kill. Restart game. Try to reconnect. Says can't connect to server. Try to join matchmaking again. I'm banned for 15 minutes. As much money as people are throwing at these guys you would think they could invest a little in their servers.
0;Don't buy this game the idea is nice but broken mechanics random goals toxic community and most importantly the specs you are playing (including your internet speed which always has to be stable even if ping rises by 5 10 you get rubber banding). You will ultimately feel bad about losing games which you really deserved to win which is unbalanced and unfair.
0;just saying if u toxic like me dont buy this game if some one will win u gonna want to kill ur self or broke ur computer and u gonna freak out with ur self! but is 1 thing that i love in this game is the trades is makes me feel good and then u wanna play with the skin u tradedand u 1v1 some one guess what happend (game deleted) if u want buy this but just saying dont buy this!! thanks.
0;Game had always run fine suddenly i start having connection issues ( Rubber banding) every single game i play. my ping is 90 on ME/Europe servers and always have been. Im pretty sure its not my connection thats faulty as i play other online games just fine. Right now the game is BROKEN for me and has been for at least a couple of weeks. This needs to be fixed.
0;Current experience with this game is as follows Matchmaking for players with similar skill level against PRO ranked players against a team of rookies and one semi pro and did I mention that most goals scored against a pve match was my allies drivbing the ball in the goal we were defending?... Quite bothersome.
0;This game is literally the iest game i own. I dont enjoy playing at all. All you do is get ads and cancer. All the little 12 year olds in the game make you tilt out of your mind and the toxic people are terible. I would not racommend this game as it is a experiance and a terrible game thanks
0;The game could be fun. The problem is the match making system is such trash you can expect to either completely destroy the other team or get completely destroyed. The best is when it fills the other team with high level players first then gives you two trash bots or beginners. If that sounds like fun best game ever. For everyone else find something better to do.. like kicking a wall.

0;"""I wouldn't buy this game because it has a bug called """"heavy car"""" which makes your car slow in general turning doesn't work as sharply and inputs don't register properly etc. Psyonix is unwilling to co operate with community to fix this major problem. For those who get the bug the game is unplayable at a higher level."""
0;Was great about 6 months ago. Sure there was occasional lag but the game was still playable.In the last few months the game has been playable in phases. During the last month the trajectory of the ball is temperamental between bounces. Cars a teleporting periodically which makes blocking near impossibleThe game just seems like rubbish to play lately and as a result has been uninstalled from my machine.
0;The gameplay is fine I have no problem with that. But the ban system is a damn joke if you say bad words not even racial slurs you get banned pretty much instantly and after 3 bans your 4th ban will be a permanent. Also the matchmaking and ranked system is idiotic too so I don't recommend buying this game it used to be so much better and enjoyable.
0;It was fun until I hit level 20. Now I'm stuck in a purgatory where everyone is better than I am and I can only win 1 out of every 5 games. I know I'm not that good at this game so why can't I play with other players of similar skill? The game is completely ruined for me.
0;Got reported by 1 or 2 of the players on the enemy team for having fun and messing with my friend in chat by calling him names. This resulted in a 24 hour ban which starts the next time you log in which was a week later. Fix your report system 1 or 2 reports should not result in a 24 hour ban. Also I guess I'm not allowed to make jokes in chat anymore.
0;Don't buy this game! You'll regret it... Seriously!!! Matchmaking is so poorly written you'll end up with teammates so freakin' far away from your own skill level you wish you could actively harm someone. And the devs don't seem to care at all. JUST DON'T BUY IT!
0;I enjoy playing this game but don't suggest buying it because my rocket league glitches and dosn't start up. I know some other people that this has happened to. It deletes the msvcr100.dll file and then it won't start up. I keep putting the file back in but now it just totally stops working. If you see running then it says syncing and stops the program then you need to replace the file. Overall I think this is a 4 star game.
0;Great game but needs a mature language filter too many baby back es that report for cursing. like what the is wrong with them either take typing out of the game or just add the ing filter EVERY other game known to ing man has one. 2nd time ive been banned because of ing snowflakes yet they spam the chat and dont get banned.
0;Great game ruined by a toxic minority. I did get my money's worth and the game itself is fantastic. But at some point the abuse went too far and I haven't played since. That was months and months ago and I'm not tempted back.Psyonix fix what needs fixing for the sake of the game!
0;This game lost its appeal when the focus was set on being the new thing at the scene of e sports and loot crates (gambling) was introduced to get certain cars. I was fine with paying for getting new cars but having to gamble for skins and cars is just too much.
0;"""Factually Rocket League is car soccer.IMHO Rocket League is a game where you dribble or shoot the ball to the opponents' goal and your ing teammates block your shot or tackle you.10/10 IGN """"Best way for your friends or stranger teammates to trigger the flying out of you"""""""
0;"""Nice game horrible automatic ban system 24h ban just because I wrote """"STFU moron"""" to another player who was insulting me and my family only because I was (way) more skilled than him.I won't play this game anymore and definitely don't recommend it."""
0;There are 3 phases of rocket league 1 you enjoy starting off and learning the game (first 50 hours)2 The matching system is horrendous and you play unranked platinum players when you are in silver great (till you reach platinum)3 you have reached platinum and the game is deeply averagehonest review (
0;Hands down worst match making in any game ever. Its also Pretty bad for a competitive game to not allow you to communicate with your teammates if they are on console. forcing a loss with every crappy psy player there is.The net code is some of the worst ive ever seen any blip in you connection at all will cause you to get hugh lag spikes. Called out there devs for boosting people and got banned from the fourms. what a piece of company.
0;The game is awesome.The pairing system is absolutely garbage.If you don't have a steam partner forget it u're screwed because u'll get paired up with people 1 o 2 divisions below and the enemy team will be way better than yours.Once u loose u'll be downgraded and to regain that loss u'll have to win 3 games.The game is good the servers and pairing system will make u want to play anything else.
0;There is plenty of good reviews about this game.I enjoy it mostly the ICE rink mod. wish that was the main game as i find the ball touch too random for my taste.what i really hate about the game is matchmaking and joining games with 1 minute to go loosing 6 nul.just fix that all ready.
0;FIX THESE F*****G SERVERS ALREADY PSYONIX!I enjoy playing this game but its lattency problem with the servers are making this game unplayable i never had an issue with this before why are you guys not fixing it already? This is a very annoying and has been going on since the summer of last year instaid of updating DLC'S and add ons to Rocket league yall should focus on making the game playable for their customers/players.
0;Its matchmaking system is the worst that I have ever experienced in a video game. If you don't have a party to play with prepare to join matches that have already started and your team is losing by an insurmountable score. This will never be properly solved until they punish leavers for intentionally leaving games with 10 minute bans so it is not worth leaving games and jumping from one to another.
0;So after the most recent update I decided to bother writing a review for this game. I have had a love hate relationship with Rocket League for over 1000 hours. This update has killed it for me however. At 74 ms I'm lagging across the map rubberbanding and missing the easiest touches I've done coountless times. I do not suggest for anyone to buy this game in it's current state. Once the patches get fixed I'll come back and update as needed
0;After many updates the game still has terrible server issues with sometimes constant packet loss sometimes it just decides to kick you out of the game for no reason. It can have its moments of fun but unless you have a full group of friends to play with it simply is not worth your time.
0;Endless matches where you have to carry players who have thousands of hours at this game. The community is filled with people below 15 years old (or atleast they act like it) that makes no sense in their argumentation or unjustified flaming. Don't buy this game if you don't want to encounter such players which I guarantee that you will.
0;Very often I have the problem that I can't connect to the rocketleague servers. At least that is what the game says. It seems to be a common problem but there seems to be virtally NO support from the devs for this. Maybe they are buisy to sell keys for nonsense stuff so they can not be bothered to make the game playable...
0;Was enjoying the game till i get on to play online and see that i'm banned for 24 hours because of cussing in a video game. Got through that ban and a few games later my teammate quits on me with 1 minute left and down 1 goal because he was toxic af and i cuss again and the other team reports me. Why can't the dev add a toggle for swear words like all the other games? Instead of having automatic insta ban for any report that contains swear words.
0;Avarage age of community is too low (around 15) and those childs are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo salty even on casual mode. Imo the end of this game is going to be this stupidity. My point is do not even think about buying the game if you don't have friends already playing the game. You can have fun with friends. (I don't even bother playing alone anymore because of that. Thank god i have people to play with lol ).
0;Physics need to be upgraded. Stuff that happens in this game over rides any kind of skill. Lucky bounces and lagging goals atleast twice every 3 games. Insane that this game has gotten so popular yet Psyonix doesnt care to fix the physics. Too worried about new crates and items when they should first fix the whole point of the game.
0;If you like to have fun this is not the game for you. A bunch of sweaty nerds that report over the dumbest things because they are losing and the psyonix actually bans people for it. Pathetic game I'll probly get banned just for making this post thats how out of control they are. Might as well give out participation trophies for everyones feelings that get hurt on online gaming.
0;the biggest thing that needs to change in rocket league is the rank matches. why should someone be punished meanwhile his team mates leave him during the match and the other team as an unfair advantage it's not fair and therefore your rank system is flawed. I do not recommend if you want a good rank system
0;Fix your ranked maches or at least pay more attention to who is placed where because other than your servers not able to handle the amount of people playing some of the time the smurfs are a huge problem for anyone actualy wanting to progress through the ranks and players arent able to actualy report people for it or at all
0;The devs stopped caring about this game a while ago. There has been bugs in the game for 3 months+ and they can only put out more crates and an update that made the game way more buggy than it was. The servers are awful and the game is dying and Psyonix knows it is so they are trying to get as much money out of this game as possible. Also the player base is one of the worst to ever be created.
0;One of those games you play again and again and don't even know why.EDIT It's not a bad game. But servers are absolute sh*t and the fact that I can only play sometimes and sometimes not because of a HCB (Heavy car bug) make me absolutly hate this game.
0;This game is a complete piece of trash. I just won in a ranked match when the whole enemy team left because we were winning and i get division down. What in the world were the developers thinking? Also when I did my placements this season I won 8/10 of my games. I was placed lower rank then I was last season. Don't bother wasting your time playing this piece of trash.
0;"""Don't buy this Got banned for 24hrs because of """"abusive voice or text chat"""". Have no idea why. Looks like those fa**ots reported me who were because I just started this game and am not as good as they are. Won't play this ever again. In fact this is the only time I'm flaming."""
0;This game has the most toxic community i have ever seen now twice in a row me and my teammate wer winning and my teammate just leaves now you'd think that the game doesn't count and my rank won't go down. but i ing did and that's why this ios the worst ghame ever ing made.It is fun with friends tho cause they aren't toxics
0;Why is this game so inconsistent with it's physics? 95% of the bounces do not make any sense whatsoever and it feels like the physics change daily. You can't tell me after 1000 hours that I am the problem. We are on version 1.42 and the physics are still garbage.
0;"""So basically it's a great game however i can't recommend this to people who are looking for """"fair"""" and """"effective"""" matchmaking this matchmaking system doesn't work whatsoever oh and the servers well it's been an entire week they're fkin up really badly so don't be afraid of loosing your rankeds because of broken servers good but broken game that's it"""
0;Excellent and very addictive game! 9/10BUT....When playing ranked matches the other team's ranks are usually superior tomy team which is completely unfair.Ranks should be identical so we can have fairer games.Devs do work hard to provide free DLC and sort bugs but this problem ishappening to me every day!UPDATE So apparently this problem was supposed to be fixed in the recent update but it's still happenning.
0;Good game and difficult mechanics to master.One downside though extremely toxic community and discouraging.Never play this game if you are ill tempered very sensitive of criticism and suffer from any mental issues as this community will hurt you severly.Other than that great game Psyonix.I do not recommend for this reason please fix your community and your bans are not helping anyone those toxic people will always come back find a way to fix this.
0;This is actually the worst game in my Library i honestly cannot tell you how i have 800 hours on it. Its probably just bc i leave this trash running. If youre looking for a competitive game to get in to I really do not recommend playing this game for kids the age 10 and under PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont waste your money on this garbage can of a game. The longer this game is not in your life the happier you will be trust me......
0;Game is broken and unplayable since april (tournament update).People getting packet loss alert (lags and 1 sec delay in game) depending on your internet connection.Don t think i got good internet i ll be fine. No. Even players with 18ping got it.Advice avoid. cause they care about new content not about fixing game.Reporting servers? good joke your code is more broke every update not servers
0;Dear god I used to love this game.... Played it day and night.... and now... I find it so hard to enjot the game anymore.. None of the hits make sense to me.. Everything that hits the bar and post just goes in for everyone... even if the ball is 90% above the bar... bars in. I miss this game when it released... for like the first 3 seasons... this game was amazing... What happened... '(
0;Awfull community quick chat only ever gets used for irony people look at their teamates like they are the opposition. A dying game that the makers only keep alive to suck money out of people that are willing to pay 300 euros for some in game wheels just because they are white thats right white the most boring color it's not even a color. Uninstalling
0;Once the servers and everything get fixed the game will be fine.As of right now the game is garbage. I used to never have problems but now I have problems playing online due to lag and connection issues. I am fairly certain that the issues are not on my end either.The game is going downhill fast.
0;laggest peice of you will buy and servers just keep getting worse and worse. They had a lan disconnect at an event where the winner would recieve $150 000. A ing lan disconnected from this game. A lan.... if that doesnt say it all I don't know what does.
0;"""Why are you reading this review for? The game is just great! Simple to learn hard to master! One if not the best game of 2015!It have turned to a money grab now. They forgot their community and are pressing out """"stuff"""" instead of like new arenas and such."""
0;i myself love the game its just alot like the other games now a days the community has ruinied it for me due to in game chat being so open im not saying take away the typing messages but make some type of word blocker i get i can turn off ther chat but trash talk and this stuff are no where near the same thing no one has ever trashed talked and told you to kill yourself ever but other then that i love the game well used to
0;I'm a Texan and sometimes (NOT ALL THE TIMES) but somewhat often get 300 900 ping on U.S. servers and it's only on this game. I also experience a lot of freezes.I have had this game for a few years and all of this only with the last few updates but even of the last 3 update have made it worst
0;Overall a well built game lacks alot of placement issues could use more than just causal and comp modes. If you have friends to play with comp is much fun and youll get far into ranks. If you dont like me gl your gonna need it with a toxic community like this one. And yes i am not champ because ive been slogging through ranks since season 3.
0;I like the game but i'm tired of the community. Doesn't matter how good you do you choke once you are trash. You get talked for the next few games then you get tilted because teammates and enemies keep talking you. I've had so many encounters of teammates and opposing players I can't tell you how many times i've laid into my desk to release my frustration. Please avoid this game ') God help you if you do buy it
0;A simply way to block/ignore people that I don't want to play with would of been a BIG plus...who the hell forces ppl to rejoin a game they just left 3+ times in a row?!? The camera (and it's settings) sucks such a great feature to be forced to look the opposite way or to have the cam clip outside the wall at goal. There was one more thing...the slot machine for crates...red flag for any sh t game.
0;If I'm not recommending this game is because there's no free look with mouse and keyboard while pad users get to look around with the right stick. Absurd. If you release a game in PC make it have PC controls. There's no excuse. Also the loot system is greedy.Other than that very well crafted game overall.EDIT Also leavers. Leavers everywhere.
0;As of late 2018 the game is polished and super fun but beware it's getting more and more like cs go and dota2 full of abusive kids thrashtalkers sexual beasts with mom issues etc. The game itself is cool but play it with chat set to off and without any other communication turned on. Community is becoming more and more toxic day by day especially in later gold ranks where almost everybody thinks he's a pro when reality is he can't even dribble properly.
0;Honestly its a fun and addictive game. In game purchases are purely cosmetic and provide no advantage over other players. The only problem with this game is it has probably the most toxic community ive seen. Players are constantly tauntung and harrasing each other. This game is better played with private voice chat as most of the time its just really toxic players who will harrass you unitl the game is done and many times after as well over steam messages
0;i have 716.8 hrs played i wish i never buy this sheety game...i wish i can hask for a refond but with 716.8hrs off course i cant hask such thing...in the beguining yes i was loving the game but then bahhhhhhh i was thinkink what a sheeety game i buy... this shet game..i wish it never be on steam or any place else...i hate this sheet game..yes im sorry but is a sheety game it have no sence cars playing football lolololol omg what a sheeeeeettttty game this game
0;"""Was top banana now it's a farce. Psyonix don't care. Crate money just goes to esport not a pro you don't matter. """"Fixed demos""""https //gfycat.com/ImpishFantasticBluegill https //gfycat.com/IdealGoldenAmericanlobster https //gfycat.com/BelatedUnderstatedCowrie https //gfycat.com/CooperativeQuaintHind Yeah sure. Fixed."""
0;This game is the most toxic game ever1 The devs set teh goal to make the most and toxic game they can and came with rocket br&gt 2 Never realese update with fix of the game only bump skins noone wants3 You can get sizure fro mthis game cuz the camera is so bad you cant stay focused whats going on4 The only way to win this game is only by lucky goals nothing else skills in this game are useless5 DONT BUY THIS TRASH NEVER BUY WALLPAPER ENGINE ITS WAY BETTER THAN THSI TRASH HERE
0;put over 250+ hours into this game. it used to be a great team game. now the community is 99% toxicity and ignorant players. not to mention the devs cant maintain the servers to play a session without lagg of some sort. if you want to play it to talk trash and not play then its a great game. but otherwise it has become a terrible community game and degraded team based game.
0;This game has the worst community of many games....all the people just tryharding in casual so many s thinking they are cool if they smurf tryhard and demo you.Anyone who starts the game and is a newby don't has the chance to evolve and all the players are just tryharding salty s who think they are cool if they beat u in a online game.
0;Great game I really love this game (you can tell by how many hours I've played it). However there's one major flaw the game will sometimes put your controller as Player 2 even in ranked matches when you accidentally disconect your controller the game will put you as Player 2 forcing you to switch to mouse and keyboard. The only way to fix this issue is restarting your computer. If you can fix this issue I'll give a good rating.
0;While the game itself is nice and deserves recommendation if you want to play it occasionally and mess around I cannot recommend it because of the developers. They lack creativity in everything besides adding more cosmetics. You can spend a lot of time learning the mechanics and stuff but in the end the game doesn't evolve. To make the matters worse community can be pretty toxic at times.

0;after having waited patiently for a very long time (specifically all of august) to play with my brother on xbox you release this ive played 500+ hours on xbox alone ( when i had one) and about 900+ on ps4 and now 150 on pc and personally love this game. in my top 5. buuuttttHOW ARE YOU GOING TO ABANDON YOUR COREno one wants this pass.
0;Is this a good game? Yes it is. However.It.Lacks.A ****** MANUAL RECONNECT BUTTON. Is astonishing every now and then I have short disconnections(about 1 or 2 sec). IS ASTONISHING HOW THIS GAME IS SO BAD TO DO AN AUTOMATIC RECONNECTION. IT BLOWS MY MIND. This simple things make a game bad. Imagine trying to power off your PC without mouse keyboard and the Power ON/OFF button. It's amazing.
0;"""the game is fun to play colorfull and lets you be a bit creative with the car selection and the modeling of it the reason i do not recommend it is for the simple reason that the servers are really poor it might be just in my country but i get """"packet loss"""" every game for days for no reason at all i play other games with no problem at all."""
0;Is it fun? Hell yes. It's fantastic and so satisfying when you improve.However if you're looking for a game with a ranked system which makes at least some small amount of sense don't get it.Grind your way up a rank or two over the course of a few weeks? Don't worry a few losses due to bad teammates will sort that out for you in no time.Would it be hard to make this system more fair? No. Will it happen? No.Buy the game just know that it will you off.
0;This game has garbage servers. The game itself is very good but I dont recommend getting into it because getting kicked out of competitive servers is a very common occurence. Psyonic only cares about the money and they still havent done to fix their servers with 100ms of lag BEING THE NORM
0;FIX YOUR SERVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I go to hit the ball and go right through it I'm getting latency issues with 42 Ping explain that to me. You guys make so much money on this game you can take the time to fix it stop adding trash cars to the game a focus on whats important to make your customers happy.
0;Matchmade mate is AFK at the start of the game so we get a goal scored against us.Mate still AFK during next engage.Mate gets kicked from being AFK.Wait 2 minutes for mate to come back.Mate no come back.Forfeit and move on.Queue up for another game with a different random mate.Same sh*t happens all over again.Forfeit because 1v2 is no fun.Lose my rank because very good matchmaking system.But hey at least theyll be banned 10 minutes from matchmaking.Nice.
0;Honestly when i started this game it was fun and players were fairly competent even in casual and low ranks the past two years ive played on and off each time i come back the community has gotten worse and no one can play with any sort of tactics unless you're in higher ranks. uninstalling for good after tonight this game has devolved from a casually fun game to a horribly toxic game where no one cares to play as a team and have plenty of trolls around in chats or griefing your team.
0;This game is a trash. I quit playing it. HOW CAN A GAME WHICH HAS BUILT IN TOXICITY LAST THIS MUCH??? I won't play again until they remove the fckin chat or the demolition. And the people here...pffff.... I can't understand how can you all be that bad that you can't win without being unsportsmanlike? Trash people in a toxic game just save your brain cells and your PC and quit this
0;"""Most disgusting ranking system i have ever seen everyother game you're garanteed to win. They place you against people who are far worse than you and then the next game you get placed against people who are above your skill level so that you have a """"balanced win rating"""".... Mine is literally 50.1%. Gets really fkn repetative and ruins the fun"""
0;if a videogame is sold in Steam it MUST HAVE the Steam Market and not private market becose is Full of Scammers otherwise is better Steam remove Rocket League.Sure i dont waste other money in useless Rocket League keys.oups i forgot the vary bad comunity that really hate the Italian ppl like me is better Steam remove this Garbage.The right name for this is Garbage League.
0;Bad game. Their servers suck matchmaking is broken was disconnected out of 3 matches out of 7and when I try to reconnect there will always be an error and then because I could not reconnect I will bet banned from matchmaking. Psyonix your game is actually drunk. Fix it!!!
0;This game would be great if the alternate maps weren't in the ranked play because every damn time i play i get the starbase or tokyo maps and they are the worst maps in the entire game. If the devs ever read my review then they should know that you keep those terrible maps in rumble for gods sakes.
0;"""this game is complete trash. Rocket league has implemented an automatic ban policy if you use """"offensive terms"""" it doesnt matter if your team mates grief or anything because if you use """"bad words"""" you will be banned from online play. Whatever implemented this system must have down syndrome or something severely wrong with them. Words on a ing videogame cause bans. In what pathetic world do we live in that actually speaking in a videogame constitutes bannable behaviour. devs. Kys."""
0;"""The game itself was fun before and it wasn't too bad when they added a chat ban not letting you say certain words even if i didn't like it but now that you can get your name censored just cuz its """"inappropriate"""" even if there isnt anything obsene or bad in it its stupid af. If you are getting upset and reporting over peoples usernames you might wanna uninstall."""
0;Product received for free. i like the game other than the fact every time you say anything bad like your a noob or you get banned i got banned for liek 170 hours idk what thats about but its unreasonable would buy if they fixed there abussive chat policy
0;In this game you will be banned purely if players report you. Just look at the recent sharp drop in players as they implemented this policy. This is ridiculous... Been playing this game for two years now and all of the sudden (2018) they decide to let players moderate! Does anyone really think thats a good idea?
0;I love Rocket League but I HATE Psyonix with a passion. They are more worried about releasing new items to sell than they are improving their servers half the time I can't play due to lag/rubber banding They refuse to bring Mac release out of beta and refuse to release full controller support for mac as well. I love this game but I can't ever play.

0;You like physics? You wanna calculate how the ball will move and act in condition with this? Forget it it is ing random. At start it was fun but it turned me out really fast. Ranked system is a joke if you win 5 in a row you get nothing if you lose 1 game you insta lose rank. What the hell?Finally about DLCs. You have to buy for 4 euros a fkin car? D I didnt expect that when I bought the game for 20(!) euros.Imo do not buy the game there are a lot better games for this much money.Cheers mates
0;after playing this game for a number of hours (in rank) i came to the conclusion that this game really punishes u if u are a good player. matchmaking is bad and unbalanced if u are trying to climb. It really matches u with people who are just good at fertilizing the earth when they are dead.
0;This game was made by a bunch of psychopaths who hate people and want to watch the world burn. There is so much unfair t in the physics everyone you play against seem to be hacking. When you are getting thrashed it is no fun but if you leave the match you are banned from finding any game casual or ranked for 10 mins. Playing this game has made me have serious homicidal thoughts towards Psyonix and pretty much every who plays the game.
0;Sins they put all fun game modes on ranked only i cannot recommand this game to anyone who likes to have a wide variety of fun without wanting to rip out their hair this game is extreamly punishing and frustrating even if you are an average playeri'v played this game for a long time because i like the different gamemodes it used to offer now you can only play this modes on competitive level witch kills all the fun it used to have.
0;It used to be a good game.But Psyonix don't care anymore.Micro transactions CheckToxicity without any working report system CheckUnfair ranked matches CheckUnbalanced Maps CheckI really loved this game but i feel like the more Psyonix earn money the more they start to become like EA or gold digger game companies. As fun as this game is i can't recommend it.
0;The matchmaking has become so atrocious not worth it anymore. Game used to be fun when it wasn't a complete waste of my breathe. 20+ matches before I can find one of even footing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. 20 matches i have to sift through to find a fun match where I'm not getting skrewed over by smurfs or season 3 grand champions. Hope all the devs get on by R. kelly for ruining a good thing.
0;Always get the maps you set to dislikeAlways paired with players over 1000 hours once you hit 100 200 hoursBots are complete aidsHalf the content is DLCSkill ceiling is infinitely high due to lagged out shots imprecise control of the ball random ball physics and half the goals being random bsToxic playerbaseThere is no thinking when you play. Simply hit the ball as hard as you can toward the goal. Spending 300 hours trying to be clever and fake people out leads to disapapointment.
0;Used to be one of my favorite games and now it is literally unplayable because of the horrendous lag and ping issues. Can't get a minute into a game until my ping spikes to 200+ and i need to leave. It's been an ongoing issue for a couple months now and the developers seem to be doing absolutely nothing about. Tried asking psyonix with no reply. Pretty ridiculous
0;Probably one of the best sport games out there it gets you hyped up and its awesome to play with friends.But what it would make it better is alot of things like the ban system matchmaking and more.The match making is horryble i played tons of competitive games and i was with veterans masters and rocketeers and i am only a pro and keep getting my as$ whooped.
0;This game has one of the most toxic communities I've ever encountered in my 15 years of being a gamer. It's nothing but hateful 12 year olds and people who abrade you for winning games because apparently everyone in the silver tier deserves to be a grand champ.
0;"""Don't play this game unless you want to get your life ruined. Full of noobs calling out for """"toxic people"""" whenever you point out that they could've not made an easy mistake. Or everyone blames you for losing if you're a high ranked player even tho you can't carry a 3 men team (probably they even own goaled before calling you out for being at the game).Getting called out for boosting if you get beaten in a casual match. Whatever guys. community overall."""
0;what a server!what an update!hey guys job done! u f...ed the game compilitly Tnx!!!!!aaaaaaaaaaa one more thing is that the bot of this game can not even thouch the shadow of the ball but it it can score the owngoal. good for the developer of this pice of s..t.f...........ck you and the games that YOU STUPID develops.

So these no life rocketeers cant be plat 1 in 1s when they obviously shouldnt be it makes this game very unfair when im playing someone with double to triple my hours every game"""
0;Yet another fantastic game dragged down by exclusive content being hidden in crates. Microtransactions are the current cancer in gaming but as usual people won't see it until it's too late and we have splash screens hidden in crates with keys being 10 a go.
0;Cons I am only getting cool decals for expensive DLC cars. Matchmaking is cancer. Community is cancer. Luckshots are cancer. The audience is applauding much louder and longer when the opponent scores. I am slowly getting anger issues. My controller is broken now. Paid to get my controller destroyedPros Music is good
0;This game was so much fun when I first got it But it got boring fast between the painful boring multiplayer and the toxic players I ran into. Disagree if you want its your right. But I expect more than 20 hours of fun out of a game. Why do I have so many hours you ask? Because despite the boring nature of the game my friends and I found creative ways to make the game fun but even that has worn itself out.
0;Love the game its great to play to sometimes and its not super competetive. But the only problem is whoever is in charge of banning people like seriously 24 hour ban? for abusive chat?!?. Exactly 100% of the time it was the other person starting to talk I never said anything unless they did. Why dont you check! this game though that killed my vibe. PUBG!!!
0;"""This used to be my favorite game 'til they broke their servers after some update. Every third game or so is a game with full of t lags. They even implemented a """"Report Server"""" in the game for players to report the broken servers since they can't fix it themselves.

0;this game is so bad i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again!

0;Rocket league was great. When I first started it felt very rewarding getting something every game. Now you don't get anything after 10 hour. Without any other form of reward or overarching goal to work for it's a lot easier to quit when I get into a losing streak. I don't feel like playing this game until the loot system is some form of consistent reward.
0;if i was to refund a game this would be the game. its like a joke where a person gets thrown rocks at for 5 minutes then they stop and say prank. like my friends always did to me when i was younger ) hopefully they all get beat up so badly they lose their teeth. thank you for reading this and let me blow out some steam as my life is ruined by all the scars on my face.
0;Great game but matchmaking and some bugs. Always getting those ballchasing and unskilled dogs... I really wish they would get banned. Can't be that i get 3 times in a row the same mate who can't play a single pass or rotate. Also the points system is a little bit buggy. A small example of what I mean https //www.youtube.com/watch?v EMsBg9aC0BI
0;4/10such a ing trash matchmaking in this game400h something like gold plat and getting matchmade with 1700h rocketeers from diamond+ every 1v1 gameyou cant really have fun in this game until you are the one who has more experience in the gamei promise youll get tilted asf after losing few goals to a 2000+ hours player that you are playing against when being a typical 200h 0 experience player
0;I have owned this game for PS4 previously before getting it for PC so all in I've around 200 hours. Community is toxic teamwork is non existant. Guy who talks thrash throughout some games is usually the worst player. There is only one style of match usually Team A constantly attacks while Team B counter attacks which results in Team A losing 90% of the time. The better you get the worse the experience gets. Avoid if you want stress free free time.
0;support isnt worth a crap just automated they dont even reach back out to you . got a one day ban for saying somthing back after being bullied all game . personally have played this game a bunch its rather clunky now . and personally imma just play somthing else i wouldnt recommend this to anyone but thats just me imma go play somthing else . only buy it on sale if u do
0;okay i wanna know. how tf do u have deep pockets but cant fix the servers. like dont u have enough funds to fix your game. ffs. fix this i have spent more than 50$ on this game. i expect better preformance. so start working instead of drinking bear and watching football. fkin hell.
0;Poor game with high rng based gameplay...and it keeps kick you from matches whitowt any reasson and after that you enter back and loss all your stats and stuff....dont buy it pls!Instead you can buy Overwatch or something better whit 20 eurosSee ya guys!
0;At its current state i would not recommend it. Latest update messed it up a bit. Specifically the server issues lately are ridiculous.Written at 1915 hours totalFeel free to play the game if you're a casual player and don't seek to play this game on a competitive level.
0;1.semi pro vs veteran 1v1 _ everytime _ like.. cmon2.no community market and official prices3.no gambling sites 4.some players have disadvantages5.some items shall cost more and some shall not6.max items u can trade in 1 trade is only 30 so u most likely get scammed with 30+ items
0;This game died when it started helping people beat you which it lierally does it helps people beat you by giving them fake goals like physics intentionally allowing people to score goals that makes no senseThis game died years ago don't buy it even if its on sale its a rage simulator for even the calmest gamerJust being honest.Community toxicaudience kids/50 year oldsskill gap Non existant that died years ago too
0;"""Really Psyonix? Banning people from online gameplay for being """"offensive""""?Get your head in the 21st Century. If some 12 year old takes offense at general banter then said 12 year old shouldn't be playing the games. The rest of us understand what banter is.Great game but unfortunately the Dev's have seriously poor mentality."""
0;Psyonix is a stupid ing who sucks at creating a game where you can have fun while being able to call stupid ing s who int lose the game. get banned for calling a dumb ing idiot a but dont get banend for inting. when will game creators realize the gaming community is toxic as so let people call them s and add an option into the game where you can block that type of talk. off with punishing people for getting off at stupid who int the game. this and all games who punish for toxic language.
0;Product received for free. I am carrying my teammate and he leave game and I division down its unfair. This game's ban system is not working and tilted players everywhere if you love yourself don't play this game because usually who play this game's ranked like most players have a rank that they don't deserve and I'm sure you will be one of them. I played this game for 600 hours and I feel I like I wasted my time
0;Dont buy it if you have bad internet if you leave you will get automatically instabanned.I got banned for 5 min just for being away in 10 20 seconds thats Buy H1Z1 or csgo much more recommended you dont get banned there for any connection issues.Reviewed by.Maxim // Maxim Nsteamcommunity/id/maximation
0;Absolute . Worst community I have ever encountered psyonix gives a huge platform to toxic players. I do not even know why the hell I am still playing this game. Most of the time winning does not even depend on skill it depends on who you get as a teammate and how much luck your enemy has. Time to change something if a player that devoted half a thousand hours to your game is off because you treat your players unfair and cannot even optimize a game so that the most skillful player wins.
0;"""The match making sucks and getting people that can hit an open ball shouldn't be a problem with """"finding players near your level"""" does jack Also if the game is """"searching for player"""" in competitive ing forget it as it will soon say """"not enough players to start a match"""" lol"""
0;Garbage game just keep getting banned while trying to have fun cant believe they still take this old game seriously. Dont play this game if youre planning on talking to the other team because it will lead to you getting banned some how some way. Apparently cant even call someone stupid without getting a 72 hour ban. Dumb game dont buy
0;I have massively enjoyed this game up until the most recent patch. Until now the DLC system for this game has been great cosmetic packs of a couple cars and accessories. However the newest update brings in a crate system which locks a ton of new content behind gambling away real money. Personally I can't recommend a game that does something like this especially after they've had a perfectly good system in place.
0;Ranked match making system does a terrible job matching you with people of the same skill. Someone with 2hours playtime can be matched with people who have hundreds and they run circles around the poor newcomers.The casual gameplay is much more fun but thumbs down for giving me terrible teammates in ranked.
0;"""Psyonix is crap and gives bans because I """"offended"""" some ten year old by saying """"kys"""" after he's saying he's gonna my mom and I think it's ultimately stupid because no other game I've played is so flakey when it comes to bans. Maybe when psyonix changes that I'll give them a higher rating but for now it's 1 out of 5."""
0;Everything about this game is fun except its cancerous community. I am apart of the cancerous community and will remain that way for the foreseeable future but I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.&gt Great Review!&gt Great Review!&gt Great Review!&gt Great Review!0/5 would sarcasm again
0;you your dumbass matchmaking system this game i hope you all ing die slowly in a fire bunch of .And i hope all of your familys die from cancer.I CAN NOT WIN A SINGLE ING GAME BECAUSE YOU KEEP PUTING ME AGAINST 3 PREMADE LEGENDS AND MASTERS AND IM PLAYING WITH PEOPLE WHO DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS GAME IS.99% OF THE TIME I WON I WAS THE MVP AND I DID EVERYTHING AND YOU ALWAYS PUT ME WITH ING AUTISTIC IDIOTS WHO KEEP FAILING AT EASY SAVES AND KEEP SCORING OWN GOALS.
0;this game has great potential but they have tried to update it and make it so flashy that lower end computers cannot keep up with the smooth quality of higher end computers. You will also need really good internet. You will look like you are hitting he ball but then suddenly your opponent is there and the ball is going the opposite direction. Good game terrible graphics. PLease fix so that everyone plays with a smooth quality
0;tryyying to get my rank at the start of the season the whole 32 ping but still getting the ing disconnect sign 24/7 doesn't fukkkking help with my rank there's 3 games lost because you are ing dumb every other game a o k but nope not rl I deserve champ for that fuk u game
0;Bans start once you start up the game for the first time after being banned. Even if someone is being a it's 2018 so you can't say anything anymore without getting the stake. Sincerely hope Psyonix kicks their stools for continuing down this path of reducing our species to a bunch of sensitive mouth breathers that attack anything white or straight.
0;used to be fun now just full of ugly virgin nerds that dance and dribble the ball at the same time even if you put alotta effort these virgins just hit the ball out of the air ground no matter which angle and everything. game community not fun anymore.
0;The recent update just nuked matchmaking. Welcome to games where you get matched agains last seasons best players. Spoiler alert They will destroy you.So for a few months until it rebalances itself through the matches I won't have fun playing heck I'll go without playing then.
0;"""Don't buy this game. Ranked system is just a sh** playing with people one and a half leagues over you (being impossible to win) or one league under you (being absolutelly pros).Besides that report system is so funny. You can get banned using the premade comments created by Rocket League but when you report """"get cancer"""" """"go fu** yourself"""" or so there are no consequences.DON'T PAY FOR THIS GAME."""
0;This game is trash only because the community is so toxic and they made everything competitive that was fun about the game ie hockey dropshot rumble etc. Diamond 1 on hockey and most of the time you get trash team mates or a team of tryhards queing together so it is way too easy to downrank. Hiding your rank is possible but that's more of a band aid. You gotta keep'em seperated...good song.
0;this game was great to start off but with their competition with fortnite it just ruined the game instead of going free like fortnite they keep the game at full price AND introduce a rip off of the battle pass which no one asked for as you should get this free as the game is full price fortnite is a free game it is fine for a battle pass this game is going the wrong direction isntead of releasing more skins and money grabbing crates which literally n one asked for they should fix their game.
0;I regret ever supporting this game and psyonix. Ban happy s. Ive never gotten so much as a warning in any other online gameplay/interaction and 18 hours match time later i have a 24 hour ban just ridiculous not to mention the ing timer doesnt even start till i open the game up almost 12 hours after i last played. Now i know thats not really related but what a ing way to hand out punishments.
0;Right now I cant recommend this game.They broke itBefore the update I was fine but now with 50 ping I lag everywhere I teleport all over the map I would be in my goal sitting then suddenly It starts lagging and im in the air near his goal without even moving.One example is that the ball was infront of the other teams goal I slam it in suddenly I get teleported back and they get a goal. If they fix their horrible servers then I will change my review.
0;This game is pretty dissapointing when you play it it's super fun but if you attempt rank it just always seems to put you against higher ranks and when you finally aren't you play an unranked and win then you don't even go up in the rank system it's obnoxious and just impossible to climb ranks so I don't recommend playing ranked
0;"""banned for 24 hours for verbal abuse? lmao. Because someone got their feelings hurt when they started trash talkin me first? LOL """"I need a safe space."""" wow Welp. back to PubG too bad felt like playin RL today. guess not. Me and my buddies play pubg more anyways. Toxic community + overzealous moderators GG"""
0;I had initially given a positive review for this game.It still is good the issue is that the devs don't seem focused on fixing the massive fps drops thir game has.Such an issue renders the game almost entirely playable and at best a hindrance to play.Fix this Psyonix!
0;This game is fun at first but when you get better at the game you soon learn the foreign developers have never taken a math class. Their matching system will put you with beginners against PRO's and you will have a 90% chance of loosing. Not fun knowing your gonna loose before the match begins. They have attempted their math skills on this match system a few time and is a TOTAL failure. Good luck
0;+Nice game to have fun with a friend Worst camera and ball physics ever created in gaming history. If you reach a high level you play with very good opponents so never a chance to win Servers are bad you just have high ms randomly and you cant control your car Afk players and leavers all time with no penalty cause its not a game to take seriously Flamers and bad language in voice chat and no penalty for salty players.Report button is just for show..
0;"""Do I really have to resort to this?Unfortunately I do. RL has a new map called """"Wasteland."""" It is much different than all other fields as it is curved like a half pipe. Yes this COMPLETELY changes the game.Unfortunately Psyonix puts this map into the rotation just like any other map including ranked mode.It absolutely ruins the game. Devs won't listen. Maybe they will if enough of us downvote."""
0;One of the worst community in gaming toxic in almost every game used to love this game but it has ruined it for me.. Don't buy unless you have a buddy or 2 to play with. Also Psyonix has one of the worst support in the industry if you write them an email because they will never answer you they're busier making new crates to sell than fixing their game
0;Competitive can be fun except for when you get maps like neo tokyo and starbase striker even though both teams have it disliked and about 90% of players dislike it. They need to get those maps out of the competitive pool or give people a definite option of what they are going to play.
0;Playing this game since 2009. Loved it back then. People were pretty enthousiast with it.Now I have to give a negative review because the amount of toxicity in the childish community ruins half the fun of the game. Until there is a serious ban system for the toxic...
0;Ok. why the hell would you ban someone like me. i play your game and have spent money on your game. Some salty 8 year old that lost to me reported me to you. Then i get banned during one of your events. fix your phyonix. Your report feture sucks. If i beat someone and they get their little friends to report me i get banned. Screw this you need to fix it. i have enjoyed your game but now i know that if i beat someone i have a chance to get banned. WTF is this? FIX IT
0;Literally like playing CSGO or COD When playing ranked...full of fake ranking boosted idiots they claim to ban boosters and trollers and also claim to fix the matchmaking and rankiing systems every season but it's still the same every single ing season full of boosted . And the new demo system is absolutley ing ...you can have somone drive infront of you on the side of their can you get demo'd for it what the physics is that psyonix ing learn common sense !
0;Not sure what it is about this game. I have super low ping. Low settings for performance. Yet everytime an action occurs in the game Players hit the ball goal is scored even when audio is cued it shows a network disconnect and lags. Makes it barely playable. Never again.
0;"""IM SORRY BUT I LOVE THING GAME BUT the thing is I CANT PLAY IT!!!! the game says """"Stopping"""" AND ITS FOROZE FOR OVER 3 WEEKS!! FIX IT OR I WILL ACTUALY TELL everyone that the games not worth it!! im sorry i dont want to have to but iv bought the game and a DLC pack iv spent like 20 pounds on this game!!!!! PLEASE FIX IT STEAM OR ROCKET LEAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
0;This game is so annoying. This dude named kobe always talk it drives me crazy so i had to uninstall. Its kinda like bullying. YOu call a girl ugly once its okay but when you do it over and over she becomes hannah baker. Thats how i feel. Makes the motivation to get better non existant because kobe always talking so im done.
0;It doesn t matter how good you are in this game! There are 98% players that have more luck than you so refund it when you can! Dont fu*k your life.. Dont buy it.... Higher you are in rank system &gt more apes in your team ) That's pretty nice when you are on plat 3 and mate in your team scores 20 points after whole 5 minutes )
0;"""One of the most Toxic ridden games i've ever played. It starts of fine &amp ya have a laugh. But later on ranked is a horrid mess of people throwing curses &amp jokes about """"your mother""""Would not reccomend if you would like to keep your sanity.P.S the servers are actual potatoe powered &amp couldn't keep a stable ping if they tried."""
0;Game is good but average age is 10 y. So kids are often salty af why cant Psyonix just remove chat ?????????? And also when u play competitive mm there are some people who dont deserve their rank and it is really frustrating when u get in 3v3 teammate with decent rank but he cant play..
0;PLEASE Fix the teammate pairing in ranked I am constantly getting paired with complete IDIOTS and players who are not on the same level of skill as the rest of the players in the match. Losing 10 games in a row is not fun whatsoever. If this is improved the game would be perfect but until then it is almost impossible to win without playing with a friend of the same skill level.
0;Stupid game with stupid f****** system when in other team with party somebody have friend with blue/gold star rank and only what you do in match miss a goal! Goal after goal.. goal after goal... YEAH! GOOD F****** GAME! NICE PLAY!! F*** stupid developers of this game!!
0;I don t recomended this game cause i t has high ping copmetitive servers as a result you can t play. also in competitive mode you don t play with players in you skill group as a lot of them are unranked. No matter if they were champion in the other season
0;game is very good I like it If you want to play with your friends online you should have this because it's cool BUT if you are like me having 3 controllers and 3 monitors you can not play eachplayer with one monitor it got some weird resolution like 50% of the screen to the first player 25% to the second 25% to the third and you can't do any thing to make it fit like each player to his on monitor if they add some kind of split screen setup staff in the next update it will be great
0;Rocket league huh? Yeah the game is awesome when u first start out. Its all fun and games but when u start to get better u get anoyed wint ranking system and pretty teammates. They cant hit it or cross it or fail at flights. U get more and more nervous as the game progresses and u just end up being mad at the game witch is esentialy just cars and balls.. If u are good u are gonna carry or get carryed. thats it.
0;This game ing suck you win you dont rank up you lose you rank down + evry time get retard and play 2 v 1 they dont have good ranking sistem that problem off this game so dont buyed if you dont have some one to play because its suck I just hate this game loot of bugs and like I say ranking sistem and ALL!!!
0;I loved rocket league A LOT. I played it pretty much since it came out on PC but with the recent actions from Psyonix and now the crate and key system being shoved into the game. I'm not going to play this game anymore and have uninstalled. I don't regret the time I put into this game I just wish they didn't ing ruin it like this.
0;DONT BUY THIS GAME... ITS A LUCK BASED GAME UNTIL YOU WASTE 2000 HOURS ON IT PEOPEL GET SO LUCKY AND TOXIC ITS LITERALLY THE WORST GAME LIKE NO JOKE AND IF U WASTED 19.99 ON THIS GAME UNINSTALL BEFORE YOU GET UR MONITOR/COMPUTER BROKEN FROM THE TOXIDITY AND LUCK OF THIS GAME... I HOPE STEAM BANS GAMES LIKE THESE
0;"""For god sake fix the goddamn matchmaking! Every time i join someone they are either Veteran or Expert. I am PRO. Dont say """" Maybe you are playing with people in your skill group"""" NO... Its the same as Black ops. ITs RANDOM. If you are a PRospect 3 then you play against Prospect 3. They can either be a lvl 60 50 40 or 75+..."""
0;Awesome game but the matchmaking system is so screwed. Me and my friends (all prospect 3 semi pros or pros) are consistently matched up with challengers whole teams of veterans and experts. I'm not sure if it's people boosting or the matchmaking system is broken. I will upload screenshots to my profile next time I get fingerbanged by a guy with 2000 hours just to prove it. Solid game though would reccomend if it didn't make me want to snap my own neck.
0;Adicting as hell. Most players don't play like it's a team game though...they hog the ball and even take goals away from you. They think the object is to hit the ball no matter what. Frustrating when you are about to score and your own team mate knocks it off course. The players ruin what would be an awsome game.
0;"""Im sadly writing this review after what seems like a lifetime. I have gave this game so so so so so so many chances in giving me a save for an actual save as ALL THIS GAME DOES IT GIVE ME A CLEARRRRR BALL WHEN i decerved a save. Do not recommend suck my nut ( left ). """")"""
0;"""My favorite game up untill the 1.39 patch since then nothing but stutters and bugs up untill the point where I cannot enjoy this game anymore. Nowadays Psyonix keeps focusing on all the """"goofy"""" updates and worthless crates instead of the core game which is now unplayable."""
0;The game play is great. However I don't spend on crates anymore because you just get ed. We already spent at least $10 40 on the game. Now the keys are what $1.50 for each. Rip off. Also Fix match making I get pinned with two rookies on my team versus three vets. Im a pro. with two rookies versus three vets.
0;Awesome concept even fun to play and hours of endless fun. Devs are fagggots though. Only reason I won't give them the upvote. Cashgrabbers at its finest. Plus they just aren't great at making their games solid. Wish that a different company had this idea so this game could be even greater.
0;game used to be fun now its full of toxic players trolls and boosted idiots.ingame report is just a joke dev doesnt even care aslong as they make money of these idiots noone gets banned so why the report button is in game noone knows server crash derank and ban. which happens way to often latelywould i recommend it to anyone i used too but not anymore. matchmaking is a joke and still not fixed.wanna have fun go look somewhere else.
0;The servers are laggy the ranking system makes no sense...I have to win 2 games to division up but I division down if I lose one game...and the game I divisioned down in I got the most points out of every single person playing. Plus the servers crash all the time. Don't get this game.
0;ABSOLUTELY AWFUL GAME DO NOT BUY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. ITS ADDICTIVE AS BUT VERY BAD LIKE HEROIN WITHOUT THE BRIEF SATISFACTION. YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN A LOT OF PAIN IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE EXPOSED TO A MILLION TIMES MORE T THAN YOU WOULD BE NORMALLY. YOU WILL LOSE GAMES DESPITE BEING THE CLEAR WINNER. YOU WILL OPEN CASES AND LOSE MONEY. YOU WILL SMASH YOUR ING DESK AS HARD AS YOU CAN. DONT BUY THIS GAME
0;i have played rocket league for 50 hours and the ranking system is so ing bad because my friend lost 3/10 matches and got silver 3 and got less goals in his matches than me while i won 7/10 with many goals but still he got a better rank so i do not reccomend this game for ompetetive player this game can off
0;Yeah this game. Honestly pretty good as far as fun and money's worth but then you get BANNED from not only competitive but ANY online play any time you say anything that is even slightly out of the PG language. I am currently banned now for a WEEK for saying &amp quot quot after I missed a save.. this game is out to me. Hey Rocket League developers that thought this was a good idea THIS IS THE INTERNET. TELL YOUR 6 YEAR OLDS TO STAY OFF YOUR COMPUTER!
0;"""psyonix gotta stop being little and stop giving bans for 24 hours 1 week etc just for saying the f word but instead fix your god awful ranking and partner system. Im a champion and get paired up with gold rank or plat. stop being soft because i said without the intention of ranting or thretening. i missed a goal and wrote """"i ing messed that up lol"""""""
0;hey idiot that made rocket league i got silver 2 rank i i ing boost my teamates i ing run on the walls and do goeal and ing flying you idiot ing give me better rank my teamate that i like boost got gold 2 and he cant even hit the ball when its on the ground
0;game is hit boxes are garbage there are terrible game mechanics this game is a luck based game no skills are involved when you can pinch a ball on the corner and it suddenly makes it to goal i play it still i have no idea but this game is and has brought my stress level super high because of the mechanics. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
0;Worst game I've ever played in terms of ping advantage.I have constant 60 80ms on European servers and every time I duel someone with a substantial lower ping (20 40ms) It's just way too hard for me.They always hit the ball first AND it always goes to my side of the field when going head to head They always hit the ball when they didn't even touch it Please fix your crap otherwise I can't enjoy the game properly
0;First off this game is great dont get me wrong and you can have alot of fun with it. The real problem is the community it toxic as crap. If your not playing some try hard up tight kids spamming over the mic everytime something happens its the trolls you get paired with that just run into you so you can do anything and if your playing ranked say goodbye to your score.
0;This Game is the worst Game i've ever played in my entire life. So iam Bronze I on 3 vs 3 Standart and on 3 vs 3 iam Platinum I iam playing like Diamond. Now iam stuck in Bronze cause my Mates are bumping me ever single time! So worst Game I ever played.
0;if youre going to make a game like this make it free. there is so much to buy and pay for in this game its ridiculous. and if you hit the ball first it will never go in you favor. the hitting mechanics and ball movement mechanics are off entirely and it needs to be fixed. i would not reccommend spending 20 dollars on this game as id rather you put it into a gram of some kush.
0;You know it was a real nice game until it decided that it doesnt want me to play it by banning me from matchmaking.Why did it ban me? It crashed. Multiple times. And now since the game crashed i have a 40 minute ban from matchmaking.That's just great. And this isnt a one time thing either you only get a 40 minute ban from leaving multiple times. it crashed 6 times in a matter of 5 hours. multiple bans of increasing severity each time. So psyonix dont ing ban people for YOUR game crashing thanks
0;This game is absolute garbage. I have no idea why I bought it a year ago. You play with someone who is a gold and you are platinum you are then matchmade with GRAND CHAMPS i repeat GRAND CHAMPS. You will not succeed in this game unless you spend more time in training then you do playing against real people.Why did i spend 900 hours in this game...
0;this game is complete trash.banning and suspending u for swearing for being a diffrent person for not being like every other that keeps his anger inside just because he knows if he swears he will get banned.This game playerbase is complete trash.These fake people are so disguisting.PLS stop bannon people for swearing they're just natural
0;Literally the laggiest glitchiest monstrosity of a game i've ever had the misfortune of liking.Sort your game out before you add pointless DLC with no point or meaning 4 ultra rares that i can craft anyway how is that rare...the certified item level counter doesnt even work properly thats literally counting and you can't get that right..it's a disgrace that you charge people money for this crap
0;For the hours i played this game I notice the ranking seems to be riggedThey need to fix the servers because people i know are always lagging or being teleported everywhere the same as me and last season i got reportedly banned for Reporting others Also they need to get rid of smurfs because they are way too annoyingAlso please Psyonix just fix servers so they can runand make it where you can party with other consoles
0;The basic game of Rocket League is quite entertaining with good physics and a decent learning curve however at the heart of it is the online competition and I have to say there are many unpleasant people playing the game who become aggressive and offensive if things aren't going their way. I say this having reached expert level and challenger elite in ranked play.Decent game let down by the community
0;"""Want to rank up in Rocket League in 2v2 or 3v3? Don't have a mate? """"hahahahahahahhahahahaha""""Psyonix manages to pair you up with and quite literally the dumbest ing people walking the planet.Never I repeat NEVER queue up for doubles or standard alone. There's a 150% chance you'll wind up with at least one humongous retard. If you're really unfortunate you'll wind up with two.Psyonix has got to fix the ing pairing system this is ridiculous. you."""
0;This game starts out fun but the current matchmaking ranking distribution and online community are utterly toxic. I'm sick of it being near the end of a competitive season and still playing unranked players who are way better than I am not to mention half the players in each skill bracket range from idiots to prodigies and it's a cointoss who you get to play. If you want a game to sink large amounts of time into in the hope to get better go play Civilization instead.
0;The matchmaking is absolutely terrible. I always get absolute teammates and I'm just expected to carry them? Why can't you put me with someone of the same skill level on my team? Psyonix needs to fix this because I can't do it anymore. Don't waste your time on this game the majority of people are complete idiots.
0;Stupid Psyonix why are you forcing us to play these stupid new non standard levels?!?!?! Even with the new stupid arena preferences (which only let you dislike 2 arenas max) it'll often put me on a disliked arena multiple times in a row!!!! AGHHHHH YOU KILLED A GREAT GAME!!!!!
0;I would love to say this game is great and fun and engaging because it is. But there's one small little problem.It appears that the developers are pussays! You can't say one single remotely vulgar thing without getting a ban in a game with servers that don't work 1/2 the time and a demo mechanic that is pretty hit or miss (even when you actually hit them). I'll stick to games that don't restrict your vocabulary (unless you're being excessive) and with consistent servers.
0;today i got a 24 hour ban for using too many rude words and that's just not on. i apologise profusely for my disgusting behaivour and will ensure all future online gaming interactions will be 100% clean and wholesomejust kidding never playing this trash again
0;This game is absolutely amazing..... however dont buy this unless you have a group of friends that will play with you consistently because this community is the biggest piece of i have ever seen. i rarely get a game with someone who is nice and everyone will chirp you over the smallest mistake even though they will make the same ones... didnt know that everyone on here was a pro....
0;It is good if you have friends to play it with. But if you dont then you will get put into games with people with no common sense. And this game should be put as a early access because it clearly has flaws like the steering the lag issues and the people with no common sense. I mean if you have a teamate dont go for the ball when they have a better shot then you.
0;everytime they update this ing game it becomes a big pile of cant even play a nomal map anymore a woman probably designed the new ones shes probably sucking the bosses so they figured they'd throw it in plus the players are all csgo s who are done with that glove opening game aswell
0;This game is awesome however the ranking system is broken af. I don't understand how I can win a game by 7 points and my ranking doesn't change. Then I get beat by 1 point to someone (or some team) that is technically better than I am by 3 or 4 divisions (sometimes 5) and I go down by 2 or 3 divisions. Makes no sense man. Again love the game but the ranking system needs A LOT of work.
0;It wouldnt be bad infact it would be great if the ranking system was better.I have seen rookies against veterans.. to get to veteran you have to play ALOT.This simply is not fair and a main reason I will no longer play as there is no point to play without a good multiplayer experience. If they can get it together and fix their VERY BAD ranking system I might come back.
0;Dear cu c k ing god your ai is a pice of s* hi** t. May have made it onto console big woop but there's no reason to play if you can't reliably practice before getting your a %ss handed to you online. This game should've had way more work done before it was released publicly
0;the worst was fun but people are % tty and match making is terrible. i played this game for years and its kinda just bull#$% now uninstalled it cause it was complete bull crap. me being a veteran being placed with legends and masters its just not fun and i cant get better when people just on me in play of the game and over chat.
0;this game is a bunch of wank and it can suck my big fat hairy just get bull ed all the time hit the ball and just s off in the other ing way so game dont bye the cuntting game no worth the money gonna uninstall the and never play it again.ps ING GAME DONT BYE THEY WILL MUG YOU OFF
0;Oh i am sorry? i was better than you so you had to ram me for your rocketleague win and talk trash i talk trash back but i get reported cool game wanna know what is also cool being treated like your in jail no talking no quick comments take away titles and make me unlock the cars again. Just because i said some bad words to a griefing opposing team sorry rocket league but i think i will treat this game as you treat me. We can both guess what that is.
0;I Love This Game It Brings Me Back Everday However That Being Said If You're New And Plan On Playing Online Don't Buy. The Reason For This Being That Since The Game Has Controller Supoort And Is On Console You Can PLay Against People Who Have Hundreds Of Hours But None On PC But Can Play LIke They Would On Console
0;Around 1400 hours and can tell you the game is fun at first but not worth the time investment to get good at it or go pro.The Devs are a really poor community and don't really listen to feedback. The game atm is going no where.If you want something to waste a few hours on go for it.Want to be pro or good like the guys in tourney's then don't waste your time your roughly looking at like 2000+ hours of gameplay.
0;repetitive gameplay unfair matchmaking specially solo standard can mix up rockteers who have more than 1000 hours with pros who have less than 200 only 5 hitbox standards used on all cars (cars visibly different) worst servers in an online game (psyonix only cares about crates ) .
0;Rocket League likes to ban people from online playits realy fun game....if you don't mind being banned for your religionvery cool of you for banning people for being jews RLsmoothcan't wait for you to ban me for being black next ing racists running RL
0;Great game played often 435.7hrs on record so far... Logged in today &lt Sept 6th 2018&gt saw battlepass system similar to Fortnite and few other games Noped back out and wrote this. &lt P.S I was a regular key buyer to pay for what i played after initial purchase and get neat things out of crate&gt Will not play so long as battlepass is around )
0;"""Another game ran into the gutter. Every time I log in to play which admittedly is rare these days because well it's just sits looking for games and never finds anything. This has happened consistently over the last 6 months or so every time. Just did yet another 1GB patch and lo and behold sits at """"finding match"""" for 5+ minutes until I just give up. No reason to keep this junk on the hdd anymore."""
0;This could be fun but... Matchmaking is full of bugs. Allways when you start game the first game is ping 300 400. Or it cant find any games for you. Or it finds but game was cancelled because of something. Im so tired for this i'll play something else.Edit Now i tried with mac and it's even worse in there you cant find any servers.Don't buy this it's just waste of money.Update Going better and better but still bugs maybe it's good game now and you can buy it ).
0;Has potential but matchmaking and ranked system is horrible. Matches lower level players with higher and tends to stack the teams. Almost every game is one sided. If you want competition stay far far away. If you want to play on occasional non ranked game with teammates that will make you question humanity then look no farther.
0;Why is it that your server updates makes things worse? the server used to be fine but now i lag every 3 5 seconds!Also when will you make an actual match up system me and my friend are experts and we were going against legends and rocketeers that were way out of our skill level!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;The base game it started with was great but since then they are only grasping at straws. Making gimmicky maps with barely of what made it so good.The players are to distinct and for pc its just poor it still requires a controller to be played properly.As a plc user i do not recommend it and only get it if it has a discount to keep you busy for a while but don't expect anything serious of it.
0;"""Hello my name is Daniel Grunt and I'm a game reviewer!When i first bought this game i was confused! I was playing with these so called """" """" they were ps4 and xbox players that i believe should not be able to play with us high class Steam players! all the ps4 players they r ing gay honestly... Sorry for that language! I just had to get it out xD!! Sionix or whatever the it is u need to removed ps4 players they are cancer and need to die tbh not gonna lie. Sincurly Daniel peece out homies"""
0;You can't trust your money to Psyonix.My steam account got stolen with the sole intention of someone taking all of my items that I had earned and purchased through loot crates.A lot of time and money went into this game and they don't care at all that all my items were taken against my will.You cannot trust that your hard earned money is secure on items bought within this title.
0;Worst Games Ive Ever Played. Triple Digit Ping Servers People all over the world connecting to US Servers Virgin COmpany who is currently going out of buisness. Same Game over the years nothings changed. All new Content is Paid For Same Maps for 20 years LOL Dead Game not worth 10 cents compared to other f2p games out there. Dont invest time and money on this pos game its so fkn bad LOL
0;i believe that boats are a soon coming addition to this game look at the proof aquadome aquadome cars that are similar to boats. as soon as the developers stop acting like a puss puss and actually add boats to this game then it gets the thumbs up from me.
0;Great game but recently ive been getting crashes. I would be playing ranked which isnt a good time for bugs to be appearing and i would get a green screen for 20 seconds then i would go back into the game. Its happened enough for me to write this review. please fix or I will have to stop playing.
0;I like this game but I can't recommend it especially if you plan on playing the comp matchmaking. Players drop out leading to 3v1 games at the lower skill levels and it's impossible to get enough wins to get out of that and to a league where people care about positional play. Really unfortunate since the other gamemodes are fun.The game also has severe connection issues.
0;nOT A good game. Always get teamed up with that block my shots. The game has adopted the CSGO skin system and it is I remember when I used to actually unlock cool stuff after a game. Now everything that is cool is in a case and the chance of getting it is smaller than my
0;Did You Do Anything To MatchmakingDid you do anything to matchmaking in the last update? Cause before the update i was a challenger 1 and now im suspect II. Every match I get like 3 goals and my teammates gets 0. ALL THE FREAKIN TIME. I only get matched up with guys with no skills. Rocket league is not recommended before this is fixed!
0;blocks you from joining a new game just because your old game disconnected fpr no ing reason. and no its not my fault. never had problems. two players on my team disconnected at the exact same moment. so go yourself and rot in hell you stinking bastards
0;With every update game gets more p2w.Different cars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses.Not all cars are unlocked if you want all cars you will have to buy DLCs which cost money or you will have to get cars through opening crates or trading which is if you aren't willing to spend money tedious as hell.
0;Game is fun...But do to server speeds it ruins the game.You have to learn how to play against the server rather than the player. When you hit the ball last and higher doesn't mean the ball will travel forward. Most of the time it becomes a random 50 50 hit.Fun game to play with Friends. But when you get to competitive if you have any sports experence you will be disappointed.
0;Literally the worst ranking system I've ever experienced. I win 3 games lost 1 game and derank 2 divisions. Oh... then I win 5 in a row and DERANK. Every since this game has come out I've insisted that the ranking system is broke. If I could have refunded this game knowing how it would be I would have done so in a heartbeat. I don't write many reviews but when I do it's because a game literally sucks so much that it should be deleted.
0;Garbage dead game Servers are absolute garbage. Why bother trying to play when all that happens is a connection affecting EVERYONE in the game. Tweet/contact support for them to tell you its your ISPs issue. Get bent would refund this pile of steaming if I could. Save yourself some money and download a free mobile version. They actually ing work unlike this rotting corpse of a game. 0/10
0;"""Pro. Good game lots of hours love it 2 much fun even with the amount of noobs.Con. Payed full price for the game + all dlcs. Now the """"Collectors editon"""" is cheaper..... sorry but this is a RIGHT slap in the face for people who have supported the game since release"""
0;Sorry but its like rolling a dice trying to predict the bounce(seems like when you are loosing its try to gives you better oportunities to shoot) and getting an straight shoot its tricky so if you are near the ball you can roll in circles and the rival can easy gets the ball.... so annoying.... the game is fun at certain point... this game will get more on a free to play buisness model i think
0;Worst game you will ever play when the servers aren't crashing and you are losing all your progress for that game the game will bug and leave you without a HUD worst game to play competitively if at all. i would rate it 1/10 it is just all round terrible and all they want is your money
0;So apparently you can't say to someone that a game was easy or anything like that otherwise you get a 24h ban. I had just arrived home with a 10 paysafecard that I was actually gonna use on RL to buy some cases but I learned my lesson I will never spend a cent on this game again.Over 500h played and I get a 24h ban for saying just average harmless stuff k.
0;I'm deeply disappointed of the developers of this game. They said the game was going to be released to mac clients by the end of the new year and still it has not been released.I bought the game solely in hope of being able to play it once it got out but now they are so far behind schedule that I gave up hope. Truly disappointed bad job.
0;They've ruined the game since introducing the second season. The game used to be a lot of fun and you could actually track your process of ranking up. Now if you lose one game for every four you win you'll still de rank. The match making is some of the worst I've seen does not seem to make any sense what so ever. I cannot reccomend this game to any one anymore. I had hoped the devs would have done something by now but its clear they don't care.
0;Toxic game. Do not let your kids anywhere near this game. Abuse sucide and depre4ssion is all that will come of it. Steer well clear money hungry game. No support what so ever 4th Day of trying to contact them nothing. Bet if i add my credit card number they snap that up in a second. Much better options out there. Also there now under investigation for random missing items and bans for no reason steer clear guys.
0;Got banned for a week for being abusive to other players. Wtf why would you get banned for insulting others.And the worst part is that a ban literally bans online play for you that means no casual matches no private matches with friends well basically nothing you can play after that except bot games you know the devs could give you a competetive ban wich would be actually a smart decision but no the devs are just s. This is stupid the developers are stupid. this game dont buy it
0;crap game so fustrating nothing drops played 12 hours since update no crates wat a load of crap wen they do its players chioce great pay to get gud stuff like usual makes the game no fun well done. mate has played it for about 3 hours today an got 3 new crates yeah great system and matchmaking still crap cant play unranked as 75% of games get cancelled wasting your time pointless.
0;Worst game I've ever played hands down. You looking for teamates? You've come to the right game. Because every game you play we promise to hook you up with Abdul from India who get 300+ ping and a kid name yourmom69 who is absolute dog at the game. I've been stuck in gold for about two months because my teamates game after game drag me down ranks. The only reasonable gamemode is 1v1 because you cant get teamates you get opponents. Fix the ranking system and fix the players.
0;The emense mm is teaming you up with salty noobs all the time. Its very frustrating. If you have played dota2 and know ITS matchmaking it is very similar to this. If you want to ease yourself from the pain that this game puts on you don't buy. Very buggy/laggy ball which makes it impossible to predict where the ball is going to hit.
0;Plays a lot like the game should be a free game. Physics are really wacky in the game but I guess if you want a game with rocket cars playing soccer you aren't looking for a realistic game. However not worth the $20 for such a minimal game. Servers could also be better.
0;if you want a rage worthy piece of that bails out the players then this is the garbage for you it takes out the fun of the game for higher ranks when it makes sure you cant beat a rookie or someone lower level then you ive played alot of hours but its just to rage worthy for anyone that thinks that they will win if they play a rookie or semi pro im a vet and division rank prospect but i kill every game with 6+ goals and still ranked low this game shouldnt get the hype it has such t...
0;Matchmaking and ranking system are in need of a major overhaul. Basically if you don't have friends to play and chat with expect it to be a role of the dice whether you get good teammates or not. If you can't carry crappy players you lose. Oh and it doesn't matter if you are amazingly good if you'd don't win the match you don't rank up. Makes no sense. Would not recommend until they fix this.
0;this stupid ing game.. it was HARD ENOUGH TO RANK UP WHEN IT WAS BY POINTS BUT NOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO GOING UP IN A DIVISION AND EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN DIVISON ING FIVE YOU CAN WIN 6 GAMES AND NOT GO UP A DIVISION AND THEN LOSE ONE ING GAME AND GO BACK DOWN. COOL. LOVE IT. YOU.
0;"""Product received for free. Probably by far one of the worst racing games i've ever played. The Maps range from a square to a square. Every map has a stupid ball that keeps getting in the way. Almost no one actually races and uses exploits to boost and fly around the map. Everyone spams """"calculated"""" and """"N*gger"""" in the chat. Forces me to buy keys just to open a crate and get faster cars. Fast and furious car has big hole in the back of it???"""
0;Since the last update me and my friend were unable to play together on raked due to him owning rocket league as a shared game!!! FIX THIS SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE FUN AGAIN!!! IT IS RUBBISH THAT ME AND MY FRIEND CANNOT PLAY COMPETITIVE TOGETHER! FIX IT OR IM RATING IT DOW
0;After 156 hours of game here is my conclusions...Pro's 1)May be fun sometime... (that's it)Cons 1) Matchmaking with no logic at all (I'm veterant and playing with rocketeer)2) Ping at Dropshot mode at evening when all other modes are ok (wtf?)3) Lots of non senseable hits...Play it only if you really bored and nothing to do at all......Or simply save your money/Buy FIFA 17.
0;It's a great game sure but many thing will make you hate it as for lag and servers issues. The community too is sooo bad try 1v1 you will have at least one guy saying you suck all the game it can be quite fun D.Play it with friends or just dont because alone it can be just sad.
0;its a fun game overall however i got hacked today they had proof of a one sided trade and who did it and even with all this they wont reverse the trade and give items i earned back so i give them a down vote there is no reason to let them keep the items and not set things straight
0;this toyko update is complet the game was fun and simplitic but now they are trying to make it more complex and thats not why i play rocket league i play rocket league for the 5min of simplistic fun if i want complex i will go play Dota 2. would like a refund to be honest if 1/3 the time i get a map then 1/3 time i dont even play the game.
0;I was really getting into this game but then after an update a couple weeks back it became unplayable. Despite having a ping of around 30 myself and a friend get constant freezes and disconnects. At first i presumed they had stuffed something up and would quickly fix it but nope.. still no change and im starting to give up on it.
0;Up against 2 PC players but you're with a playstation user. You might as well leave the match because it's 1v3.Rate this game 10/10 because play station users ruin the game they ing suck. They ram into you they mess up your goal shots they shoot the ball into your own goal/ect.
0;"""This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Ever hit a ball so hard it moves backwards? Now you can. In this game the physics are F****D. The driving and car styles are absolutley horendous. There like some kind of Tonka toy a kid would play with. Save yourself $20 and go buy an 8th of weed and enjoy life without this so called """"game""""."""
0;I hate this game with a passion on the top ten things I have wasted money on in my life this is on that list right below a lottery ticket. Its not the graphics or anything about the game except the human element within this game sucks. If I could get a refund I would delete this hot mess out of my life.
0;"""Got scammed for skins I dont even care about through steam chat through one of my """"friends"""" who got """"hacked"""".As soon as you get any super rare item in the game you are going to get spammed with scams from all angles because Psyonix makes your item library accessible to third partys without your permission so the scammers know when to hit you hard.People beware of a site called rocketleagueX it is a total scam."""
0;Game is the shitest pile of crap with full on V neck sweaty cucks who have dorito's sitting on their router and can't even bend over to reach their toes. People that sweat out and get pit stains in this game make me sick. The best bit is when you intentionally get blown up by the crappy s who would be better off ended KYS SMH.
0;I hardly play and still own diamond 3's like nothing so this is credible. The physics engine is horribly inaccurate and latency even with distributed servers is a mess. Additionally these developers allow for hardcore racism to be slandered in game. Don't subject your children to this.
0;off this game legitimately can suck my dads fat ing I have spent a total of 200 hours on this ing piece of and i dont really know why. I honestly would rather throw my is to a ing blender. Like seriously off rocket league. you and your ing developers can ing commit this game is a waste of time breath space hours money es loyalty. I could create a better ing game off the back of my dads ing smegma. YOU S
0;literally the worst game I've ever played. Let me edit this real quick. Literal ing garbage. No way to add friends no remediation for ranked game leaves quite possibly the worst ing match system available... it is punitive and broken. Unplayable mess of complete and utter t. Do not buy. DO NOT BUY
0;Fun game and all but if your game times me out why the should I get 15 minute penalty? Wasting my time making me not wanting to play this game over stupid The game even shows me an error code when I get kicked? Is that my fault? No its the game's fault and the game's server. Fix it
0;"""are you tired of hackers in CS? are you tired of VACs false promises? Do you think this game is going to be different? It is a good game but hackers are so heavy just play the game and say """" why do you have a VAC ban?"""" and 2 3 people will respond with why they hack but in their minds its ok so if you like HVAC or HACK games this is a great. pre hacker 8.1 post hack 3 less then h1hacz"""
0;Please stop with all the DLC you are ruining the game. At least include the new stuff if you have to make new cars... its annoying to have to pay to have all types of paints and .. i mean come on i paid 20 ing dollars for this small car soccer game at least give me what i ing paid for... i hate dlc...
0;I have a 6 core processor and GTX 970 well over the recommended requirements of this game. It is choppy randomly lags because they use trash servers single player mode is a joke and pointless all while they lure ppl in with hats or prizes that don't mean a thing. DO not buy this game.
0;Please ing help me I have a desktop that crashes sometimes but quickly restarts. But when I get back to rocket league I often get a time out from match making because it thinks I left on purpose most times I do not even get the oppertunity to re connect. Which obviously is horse Thank ing god in advance but surely you can ing fix this. Especially the incrementally larger time outs.
0;F*ck this Game. In 2 days playing i get like 1 time Wasteland Map and 2 times Tokio Map. So when they handle that like this my thumbs down will stay.Edit Thanks developer for ruin the game by listening to the kiddie community and thank your for the last update every second game laggs.
0;As a player from Western Australia the lag makes it really frustrating to play at higher levels. The slight lag is enough to make you miss an occasional shot and this is a pretty big f*king deal when you are playing with other really skilled players. NEED SERVERS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA!!
0;"""I played this game about 200h and i realised that my life is worst than it was. i should be rising star or higher but everywhere is a hacker in every in' game. just dont buy it. EVERYWHERE HACKERS AND IN' KIDS. Not recommended at all. """"Rage League"""" 19.99$"""
0;ing gambling worst game ever created it requieres so much precision that you will loose always at least 7 of your 10 games played a day or 3 of 5 games a day.the 1 vs 1 is even worse as the only factor that mades you win is Luck doesnt matter how good you are at this game.This game has very poor physics. Making you loose most of your games.
0;honestly liked at it first. until I realized the most dumb care into a game I ever seen. Getitng matched with people 3 times my rank and my team has all rookies and semi pros? gimme a break man...plus the AI in season mode is the worst I ever seen. Not impressed
0;I leave one game because my teammates...well...did not know which is the right goal. Nevermind. RL JUST LET ME LEAVE THIS ING ROUND. I dont...i repeat.... I DONT want to join the same round 7 times in a row again...remember i left this round. I LEFT! What is this for a systems which gave me the same round which i left over and over again.....???? We have 20 k player in the playlist and i find the ing same round 7 time in a row? Im Out have to drink some whiskey to calm down.
0;This game is so bad i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself also un installed 44 ping but game keeps skipping not my graphics card or anything.
0;Rocket League AKA. Cars 'n Balls Football Cars Top Gear Car Football simulator. Would rate 9.8/10 but to be a 10 would require the game to include a Tuk Tuk DLC in the future. Therefore I do no reccommend this game and will only change my reccomendation when a Tuk Tuk DLC is added so I can follow me dreams of becoming a professional Tuk Tuk Footbal driver and make my father proud so he stop beating me savagely with a coconut every night.
0;Okay so i played this game for 100hr+ without any problems using my ps3 controller. Then i came back today to play a couple of rounds but now my ps3 controller is only playable as player 2...WTF!?! Now i can t play the game until it is fixed. (Note I have uninstall and install the game to see if it works and uninstalled and installed the ps3 controller drivers. Nothing Works)
0;Matchmaking is terrible. You regularly get 20ms ping players paired with 200 800ms players while the game is unplayable above 100ms ping. This happens in competitive 1v1 as well.I don't recommend this game.Update since season 4 matchmaking is super slow. Expect 5 minutes between games instead of 30 seconds.Update ... and a rank reset again. Every season (say every 2 months) you have to earn your rank again and end up terribly matched for about 50 games.
0;This game is cancer. Servers are so poorly maintained it made my mother divorce my father and made my dad kill himself. The auto ban system made Donald Trump win the Presidency. This game gives loser bubbles to all the kids giving them Bull hits like Bernie Sanders giving away free I get no bubble and my car misses the ball and the boost by 1mm and i slit my wrists a little deeper. This game is why ISIS hates America. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. Me 0/10 10/10 IGN
0;There is absoluitely shocking amounts of server lag if you are thinking of buying this game do not... at least until they sort it out.My ping is 26 (easily low enough) and my car slides all over the place with the disconnect symbol appearing. TL DR DO NOT BUY until they sort the servers out.
0;I'm Writing This Review Again Rocket League Ok.... This Game Was Fun When i bought it like 4 months ago But Now They JustDid Something With Middle East Region and Now The Game is Not That Much Fun As it Used to beI play on Eu Now Cuz its Less Laggy Than Middle East 6.5/10 Just Because Game Have good psyics and i can score some good shots in freeplay Competetive Match Making Is Rigged Literally Rigged Why Do i have to play with someone who is Diamond 2 ? and im plat 3? I dont understand
0;"""Sometimes I wonder if some have the option """"disable skip"""". This frustrate me alot and put me on a tilt making me lose games and sometimes I swear and get really angry. I have killed my dog and my wife has left me. Don't buy this game unless you can handle a game with nonskipping dorks. Loads of germans aswell learn english maybe"""
0;I dont understand this game. Everyone plays 10 placements and get down bottom to prospect 1. So why have placements when you start from bottom anyway?I just hate that i must now wait couple weeks to get nice balanced matches. Its not even funny to have newbies and legends in same match!Its in the sale you can buy it now but dont waste your time on now. Do something funnier for couple weeks...
0;"""This game did not have The Bahamian flag. It has The Jamaican Flag but no Bahamian flag. The Bahamas is richer and more stable than Jamaica why must games spit in the face of my country?This and the fact that steam region locks me with a bunch of spanish speakers when everyone in the country speaks english... war is the only option. Once I get my flag / We win the war this will be changed into a """"yes"""" reccomendation."""
0;After so much time spent in this game i can say for sure.Don't play this gameYou can be the best player you can do everything right you can just follow the basics your team will crush your hopes and dreams when you try to achieve something cool.And they allow semi pros and lower ranks to join ranked games ing absurd
0;Ehhhhh.... really fun game to start. Lots of bugs and plauged by lag spikes. Sweet first week of play but then worthless. Buy and try. Then quit.*Edit* Bugs are fixed i guess. Lag still ruins games. 1v1 is depressing for that reason. Rubberbanding is just depressing. Can be fun with friends but they haven't fixed multiplayer across platforms either.
0;this game is great but keys and crates why. who want that i love this game and fun for love but keys come on there are other ways of make this game great. like have about custom falg option lol guys new csgo lotto this is not waht the game is about and wach this hurt the game ( sad day sad day so no if you are new i do not recommend this game under $20 wach the youtube for all that i think Lightningmaloy i am going to cry in the csgo room (
0;Pro really good game with a lot fun VS Con Crossplaying with ps4 sucks and disabling the option doesn't do Also double jumping high in the air is and I don't how the people do it after being in the air for so long. this game now until they fix both of them.
0;Servers are laggy especially when in Competitive. Not to mention the fail competitive system. When someone leaves in the first 10 seconds (or even later) the game is not cancelled or you don't get a bot to help out. If you like frustration this is the game you want
0;If u join a game it is some time a crap round u cant even win 0 8 and the balancing also doesnt work so well.A good ping is very import if something other than the game happens on the home net work a get a latency over 300The new Maps are crappy as hell. Few people like them and on the aqua map u get a hell of a frame drop.Game engine puts u into games already lost with some seconds left to play or already over. With every update it got worse.
0;You pay 19.99 and every two months or so they come out with new DLC. but of course you have to pay 5 dollars every time and they rarely come out with anything for everyone to not have to pay. the game is okay other than that its just annoying that you're given anything for supporting the game in the first place.
0;Nice ING game you ing SPERGLORD HIT. Holy it pisses me off when some unoriginal assholish dickweed decides it would just be ING HILARIOUS to make the SAME. OVERUSED. GAME. What do you even ing hope to gain out of this? Karma? Well you're certainly getting that cause it seems like a lot of other inbred ing autistic are thinking you're just ING HILARIOUS and that this GAME HASN'T BEEN MADE A BILLION ING TIMES. you.
0;This game is trash dont get it. Everyone gets super lucky and gets the best bounces against us. Gibbs ur garbage at this game. This game matches you up against pros when you are about to get promoted or season reqards. Pay2win keys give you items that make ur car faster. Mantis is the only good car. I heard Psyonix the developers miss the North Atlantic Slave Trade. RIP. Buy a good game like Knack 2 or Sonic Forces. You can make ur own sanic in that game rocket league has no sanic RIP.
0;Probably the worst game I have ever played. Its fun at first but once you get use to the controls you realize the game is jsut 110% luck that's all it is. Anyone who says different is delusional. Community is garbage like most it's full of obnoxious cretins who'll just spam the chat with insults.
0;"""The barrier of entry for this game is a IQ that rivals that of human potatoes. If you pass this simple task you're on your way to becoming the next pro level Rocket League player. Get ready for """"fun"""" bounces that will have both you and your opponent asking yourselves """"Why am I playing this horrible excuse for a game?"""""""
0;Okay Yes it's fun. Nothing to say about that.But please when you charge 20 Euros for a game please have servers ready. If you have more than 45 MS the game is unplayable. Moreover on game out of 3 the server lags like crazy (i.e. you see things teleport).Good idea. Terribly executed. Do NOT buy !
0;"""Gameplay is smooth and addictive better with friends might I add but there is something lying beneath. Devs have released an """"update"""" oh wait I'm sorry the update is $3.99 my mistake. Greedy developers... I paid for the game once already why should I have to pay MORE on top of that for a release that should be free and as an update. You have a great game here and I see alot of potential but don't go down this road."""
0;I HATE THIS GAME. ITS NOT WORTH THE $22 CRAP GAME. NEEDS BETTER GRAPHICS AND MORE CARS. THE CRATE SYSTEM IS CRAP. THERE SO POOR THAT THEY NEED TO BRING CRATES INTO THE GAME. LMFAO ROCKET LEAGUE. THERES SO MANY PEOPLE WHO PAYED $22 FOR THIS GAME AND YOU STILL NEED MORE MONEY. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS GAME AT ALL.
0;Very bad physics game. Physics are made up and aren't real life applicable. There is no accel due to gravity. It's a set fall speed. It makes timing impossible unless you put time into this game and disregard all real life physics. THE GAME ING SUCKS BECAUSE IT MAKES UP RULES. this game. I hope the developers go broke and the pro scene dies.
0;Ihave 1.8k hours in this game and im boring of toxic and bad players full community of scammers bugs in the game servers...Dont buy this game if you want to play something fun go on PUBG(but now is full of cheaters) Fortnite(good for all players and very fun) Poe(very solid and fun game) and some others.DONT BUY THIS GAME you can do better things with 20$
0;The game is amazing dont get me wrong i love this game but i would not recommend this game as long the servers are still ed!.You can play a game where you think you are going for the ball but suddenly the game lags and you get teleported back.So this game is good but do not buy it untill they fixed the servers
0;this stupid game can't let u play a game with a local PC just like warcraft 3 i can't imagine how the devoleper didn't thought of that simple idea we always have to play online all the time and can't play Co op advinture mode on splitscreen in the same PC stupid game i don't recommand this stupid.
0;Do you like playing solo and want proper matchmaking? Steer far away from this title matchmaking constantly places you to lost matches or solo against teams of 3.Ranked is a joke as both team queue and solo queue are on same queue and penalties for leaving are minimal. (15 minutes before you can rejoin and no ranking loss)Until they fix matchmaking issues I cannot recommend this game for solo players.
0;Online server's haven't worked since launch. No signs of these issues being fixed. Sick of devs releasing games that don't work properly. Simple open beta to test the server load before launch could of easily forseen and help prevent this problem.The game itself isn't terrible but without online play kind of defeats the object of playing for me.
0;Game is Each patch breaks something different. Lag Hits Ghost Hits Demos not working Car physics on ground not consistent. Updates break ball &amp car physics (sometimes before major events) Servers still run poorly especially after major patches Updates mostly revolve around crates/keys
0;I love this game and the only reason I dislike it is because the server connections are absolute for me. I got a 100mbps download and 40mbps upload speed with a ping to the WEST COAST from North Carolina being only 67 but god forbid I join a game on the EAST COAST servers because then I get 100+ ping. Fix your
0;Just like every other promising company the moment they smelled money their aproach towards the updates are totally money milking based. Servers became malfunctioning and they don't care yet they force you to play with the Premium Pass system that is basically ripped off of Fortnite. Once again greedy human nature triumphs. Don't buy this game. The fun aspect of the game is completely gone as the game pushes you to care more about useless cosmetics than the actual gameplay.
0;Well after 200+ hours in this game I can sayEvents GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND!Level GRIND GRIND GRIND !Drops GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND!Rank Win 1 game get 1 divizion 1 lose 1 game lose 2 divisionsTraders Most peoples I ever met buy things for 5$ sell it for 10$Fun Only if you play with friendsIn the end SALT SALT SALT SALT SALT and full of cringe kids who say ez at the end even if they loseIf you're looking for a game where you want to grind more then in world of warcraft you found it.
0;Every single time I think about playing this garbage I got trolled flamed own goaled by my team mates and left alone vs 2 other players.This game is a joke and the devs only concern is money. And if you want to play this garbage avoid playing alone by all costs or else you'll have a stroke.
0;"""Horrible game studio in charge of this game. Psyonix's only priority is to make more money from loot boxes. Servers are usually laggy and buggy (rubberbanding teleporting). The """"Competitive"""" Matchmaking system is completely broken from all the boosted players at every rank. Majority of competitive games have toxic players or toxic teams."""
0;1v1's are just cheap and ing cancer tactics.2v2's are just 2 friends matching against one equal skilled oponent and a ing .3v3's are just cluster s untill you are very skilled and only playing with friends.its pay to win with the dlc and realy ing repetetive. was better before tho.
0;This was a really fun casual game. I'm not a gamer I play games for fun in my spare time after work or in between projects. However ever since season 9 when they decided to bring competitive to hockey it's been nothing but stress. No longer can you find a fun group and endless queue you're forced into new opponents each time. They've ruined a game I had spent 300+ hours in.
0;Game crashes affecting my rank is BS. The game should be able to tell when the it crashes as opposed to when a player is quitting out and not penalize the competitive ranks. I was gold level and with a single crash i got shipped to lower silver divisions. Ugh.
0;if you only play this with people who you know its the best game to play but the community with this game is one of the worst out there. every person you meet in game will swear at you and just overall be rude to you in any way they can think of and the ranking system doesnt help by placing you against people multiple ranks above you consistiently and those people rudely refering to you as any number of explicit names. Would not recomend for anyone without 5 friends to play it with at once
0;"""Customer support sucks big time (They always seems uninterested and try to blame everything on you). The servers also suck (packet loss high ping disconnections). The community sucks toxic and microphone spam without the possibility of report or the customer support doing anything. Season pass? Loot boxes? Really? Greedy Psyonix what not... No crossplay and sh*** PS4 crossplay? Just have """"patience""""...But the game is pretty fun. 5/10"""
0;1v1s gave me cancer...Literally 98% ing luck.Game is only fun if you play it for a laugh for about an hour and then uninstall.Trying to learn this game seriously is like trying to fit a spoon into a USB port Probably doable but ing pointless and filled with ING USELESS LUCKY ..10/10 would get outlucked out again.
0;Bad servers several bugs weird ranking system you lose points when the server disconnects (nothing you can do about it). Game is 70% based on luckFun to play for half a hour a day when you play longer than this amount you will start to become aggresive and break your shoe.GG
0;Ask yourself why do you play video games? My answer is to have fun. This game is fun at first but is no longer fun. It is extremely toxic. 95% of the time I play this game now I end my session very very unhappy. Therefore I don't/can't recommend this game.
0;I love this game I wish I could still play it. It stopped launching months ago after trying every single thing I can possibly find on google to remedy the issue aside from reformatting my computer which isn't happening. I know I'm not the only one who faces this issue and I find that to be pretty ridiculous and ultimately I can't recommend the game to anyone now because of that.
0;New update? You mean new downgrade.. Nice job psyonix online is unplayable since i get stutter every seconde and lagspikes every 10 secondes. Not only me but at least 80% i play with get it to. Stop focusing on cosmetics and money and fix your goddamn game first
0;It's a good game the problem is...Psyonix. These devs made a great game and they now care more about crapping out new skins and re skins of maps for money than fixing the trash servers and the trash camera and the other bugs surrounding the game. The only way I'd give this game a thumbs up is if these devs are releaved of control which they should be because they are stooping to the level of gold digging .
0;game concept is good but after 1020 hours there's still so many people that just don't seem to have a brain like at all. It's as if they don't understand basic physics. If i hit ball here ball will go here. That kind of thought process doesn't exist. So for the base game as a bit of fun to drive a rocket car into a ball it's great as a team game stay away if your IQ is over 40 mines 41 and I still cant stand these people anymore. I finally snapped morons inhabit this game now shame.
0;"""Edit This game is now.repetitive boring and full of 12 year old kids that false report you.I got banned by a 10 year old (no joke.) for saying his username in chat.Guess what his username was..."""" digger dagger fagger""""and HE reported ME for saying his username in chat.I got banned for 72 hours straight. thats 3 days.I'm not going to flip off Psyonix just yet. I'm kindly asking for them to remove my 72 hour ban because of this childish reason."""
0;Great game overall but the constant crashing interface bugs and not being able to play with a ping less than 150 makes it not worth the price.Edit Everything appears to have been fixed!Edit 2 Servers are utter garbage PSYONIX seems to always choose the cheapest servers available.
0;Matchmaking is horrible if you're in the heartland. 33% of games it will give you a &lt 50 ping server. 33% of games it will give a 80 90ms server. And for the final 33% it gives you 120 140ms servers. Consequently you will loose 1/3rd of your games no fault of your own and be stuck in the gold class.
0;"""The game is great BUT Wintrades (hate this one) Kidz Trolls Elitist (those who are gold and they believe that are god and dont want to """"carry you"""") AFKers.

FIX OR CHANGE AND EXPLAIN MORE CLEARLY!!"""
0;Horrible matchmaking.In standard there's basically 0 matchmaking. I have 0 interest in competitive. I started playing over the free weekend got hooked and immediately bought the game. Wasted $10. The horrid matchmaking (or lack thereof) really ruin an otherwise extremely fun and addicting game. I am a complete noob and am constantly being matched against Veterans Experts who can pull of aerials reliably and most games are complete blowouts.Fix the matchmaking Psyonix
0;+ Great game overall+ Lots of fun especially with friends+ Support for low end machines+ You can turn off the chat Server problems that are growing with each update / month Insanely toxic playerbase ( but you can turn off the chat and not care ) Loot crates that you can open only with real money (excluding rare events for free keys)
0;I have had a lot of fun playing this game overall but I just found out that the ranking system intentonally creates win/loss streaks by pairing you up with other players who are either trending up or down. This seems very dishonest to me and I regret the importance I placed on percieved perfomance in ranked matches.
0;Massively overrated majority bad mannered community and developers who want more money so they introduce gambling for kids CSGOgambling.and the amount of times I've joined a match only to see the scoreboard is ridiculous. I doubt the devs even care how they are.
0;i have recently stop enjoying this game i dont know if it just my luck or others have the same problem climing the ranks i cant seem to gain anything or enjoy it as i have at least one person that sit and give verbal abuse or i have people that just want to stop their team winning.
0;Love this game. Although the servers are really starting to change my mind. I swear I can't go more than 4 5 games without lagging to the point where I have to just quit. My internet is fine. My ping is around 30 40. I really do enjoy spending time on RL but if this continues I'm going to have to say goodbye. (
0;This is a fun game and it kept me entertained for about 2 months after that I lost interest. The hype around this game has gone. I tried coming back but I am not as good anymore. This game requires consistency playing regularly is key. To be honest I am 50/50 on this game it s fun but lost its charm.
0;this games you more over than any other game is just random crashes when you are playing ranked does not let you rejoin the game cause it says no reservation found and then gives you a ban it's realy nice that they update it and then is starts crashing for a lot of people and still don't fix it so ty for my ban + you wan to get spam from replays that i would recomend this game 12/10 it's spams you even after you want to leave a game or you are roasting the other team sike you saved a replay
0;"""Incredibly frustrating to the point of wanting to break stuff it rewards a very """"sit back and wait"""" mentality akin to Chelsea parking the bus. Also the lag gifts so many goals to players it's quite frankly tragic. It was fun to begin with but now everyone is aware of arse tatics (such as ramming or just waiting at the goaline constantly) it makes for nothing but a sore head and a cloud of curse words."""
0;this is a game that commends luck and ignores skill at all but the top .5% of play hitting the ball ends up just being an rng determination and physics seem to be made up on the spot its completly inconsistent with how hits affect the ball the game should be good but every time i go reinstall the game to give it another shot im instantly reminded that unless i spent 3000 hours on the game my input into it means nothing!
0;This game was loads of fun when it came out as surprisingly there were little no no issues with the lag. Now the game is how many months old and the connection is garbage. I can't believe they're still updating this game with the connection the way it is. Legit garbage. 2/10 congrats on being trash
0;Hello community.I totally do not recommend playing this game because it is full of toxic little and boosted kids and at the end of the day you will end up with a 24h ban for putting a kid in his place so yea this game idk i totally do not recommend it
0;"""I dislike this game because of toxic players who purposely you off and then when you say anything back YOU get banned. Unfair and horrible monitoring of """"reports"""". It's way too easy to get banned in this game from any snowflake that can't take what they dish out."""
0;A great game however the report system is broken. I am a defensive person when someone is toxic i am generally toxic back if nothing was said and they make a mistake i wont say anything because I realize everyone makes mistakes however I Somehow have ended up being 24 hour banned without warning. thats fine and dandy the people have spoken but ban timer doesnt start until your next login....
0;This use to be crazy fun! BUT they have changed the whole feel of the game. It includes micro transations now and the free drops are very few and far between. I would change down to 79/100 now. I dont like the changes and have lost interest as a result.
0;psyonix is a ing awful developer who is run by sensitive ing who ban you for a week for calling someone an idiot i bet theyre all ing scrawny insecure virgins who havnt dipped their in anything other than an 3 year old unwashed fleshlight their calls home
0;"""DO NOT BUYThe game is released since 2 month now and already selled a DLC but the server have not yet been fixed!

You can not play a game without massive server lag """"rubberbanding"""" teleporting of you and the ball to random places on the map..."""
0;Purchased this game for a Mac soley because steam shows it has full steam controller support. There is no steam controller support whatsoever as of 12/12/16. Do some research and check out the forums nobody has a functioning controller with this game anymore. Buyer beware or hope for a fix.
0;This game has wayy to many lagspikes and glitches up its sleeve as well as campers farmers and just smurfing as well as laghackers that set someones ping to 1000 in order to be kicked.only upside the look.whoever the devs are.just no.get it fixed.after all these spikes exist since i ing bought it and my other friends have that too.edit still no performance changes nor any hitbox improvisations
0;used to be good everyone is just sour and horrible now im pretty good but if we lose my team mate just berates me and i just cant be bothered anymore. 9 times out of 10 i have the better score too but im just sick of the ammount of toxicity now . just get reported if we lose like WTF dude chill if i could get a refund i would
0;Wasn't actually banned or anything but absolutely despise Psyonix for implementing an automated permanent ban system for simply using bad words. Instead of giving chat bans they simply ban you from the game without the ability to appeal. Also we don't own the game anymore the ? Everybody nowadays caters to crybabies and snowflakes.
0;Whilst this game and it's fundementals are awesome I cannot support this crate gambling they have introduced into the game now with DLC that you can only get in crates makes it even worse yes they are only cosmetic but kids get hooked on this and with no guarantee that they'll get the item their after they'll keep buying keys at $2 a pop until they do...This sort of microtransaction system is greedy and toxic you should be able to earn keys in game...
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Online gameplay is IMPOSSIBLE due to constant lagging. This problem has been going on ever since the game was released with no improvement. I am highly disappointed. I feel like I have been cheated. It could be an AMAZING game if Psyonix actually cared about the quality of the gameplay and fixed the thing.
0;Good game but matching system is really suck ! When you're matched up and you got into the game you saw the score 5 0 ! and you were on the 0 score team ! this is suck and who's gonna play that match ? it cause too many leaver ! of the game. Matching system is suck as !

0;Product received for free. Except fps drop problem w gtx 1070 gameplay is awesome. Cars playing football lol. The game is interesting and enjoyable you should buy this game. ing fps drop made me stop playing this game. Gpu doesnt go over 570 mhz so I cant get any good fps. It happens only in this game. So I can say that If you have an nvidia gpu pls dont buy this game
0;Rocket League has the worst servers ive ever seen in a game's multiplayer. With 500 hours I'm quitting. The servers just declined in quality from release. It's become unplayable at this point. With 50 ping and 60 fps constant my car will rubberband everywhere and the ball is completely unpredictable. ggwp
0;veteran level player last play last review. It's good concept for a game but it has a terrible community terrible matchmaking. skill levels and in game economy is way out of proportion. spent over 50 dollars on cars and keys yet the mk2 versions are so rare that its not even worth it. this game is no longer fun for me the developer is just selling out to companies that wants to produce ad dlc.
0;"""I recommend this game as """"No."""" I Just logged into Rocket League and what do you know. My level items rewards and RANKS have reset. Some of the items to name a few that i SPENT MONEY TO BUY KEYS WITH THAT ARE ALL GONE are Hexed Wild Cat Ears Reaper and much more."""
0;Everytime there's a new update for this game its seriously just more crates. This game has problems and the developers just refuse to address them. I'm uninstalling this game and I'll NEVER play it again. Hopefully they fix it for the other fans that had hope for this game but as for me I'm done. 0/10 would never recommend.
0;Need to balance out match making. I know playing against players that are better help you out a bit. But if you're trying to learn the game and you're teamed with semi pro players getting matched against Vet's and Master's is a bit ridiculous. I can't have fun with this game when I can barely have a balanced out skill level of teams.
0;Game is fun but match up in competitive suck hard ! And competitive points reward suck ! win 10 game in row dont up in rank ! lose one game lose 3 rank... ok wtf really I beat people with more elo and I get nothing but if they beat me I lose elo...... WOW just WOW
0;Game? 8/10E sport? 10/10 it's amazingPrice? 9/10Community? 2/10The game is really good but the community is one of the worst if not the worst trust me i've played league of legend for 5y now. If you don't give a f**k about everyone trash talking the game is for you!
0;No crossplatform online partying. You cannot invite your friends from PSNET and then queue online together.Otherwise wxcellent game. If you have a beeffy enough computer you can use 3 screens and 3 contollers to play 3 way teams online from a single tower and each person can have theri screen. 1/10 for not inclusing crossplatform partying.
0;I can't remember anymore how many times now South America servers suddenly stop working for days or weeks and Psyonix doesn't even give us a response. South America servers have been broken for months and Psyonix doesn't give a If you are from SA DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. They take at least 2 4 weeks to fix it since we are not enough people playing so they don't even pay attention to us or even give and estimated time on when they'll fix things. Psyonix you suck.

0;Fun simple game. There rerally isn't anything to it yet a keep playing for hours.ban me becuse my isp droped my conection... ONE TIME are you kidding me there was nothing i could do and i never quit games. 500 hours in i still havent quit a ranked game and i get baned first offence. you gota be kidding me. goals that shouldnt be goals and some that should and are not. get it together for a game that has such a following now psyonix really cant get it together.. 
0;This game used to be great. Now the match making is crappy unbalanced (I'm either against people clearly better than me or against people much worse than me) and the servers suck. The community is also a toxic mess try to make any constructive suggestions and you get hounded by people who think with their rank rather than their brains.That's not to say the base gameplay isn't good however I can't say I enjoy playing it anymore.
0;Bought the game and i can say that i had good fun with it... untill the developers stopped caring about their sh*t... Server crashes... High ping on european server (tested on diferent networks).... So please... if you want to maintain a multiplayer game... at least get the multiplayer part right.
0;This game became bad once Psyonix added in crates. Now the game is basically a trading simulator filled with microtransactions. At least in the beginning the gameplay was fun and the graphics were great. Now the gameplay is boring and old and the graphics are decent at best.
0;servers suckedfixedthen it was a great gameseason 3 comes alonggets placed from challanger 2 to the silver one of this game just because 4 / 7 games played where with ppl still trying to figure out how to actully move the goddam carwich is quit frustrating.I had this match where I was going 1400 + and my teammate was going 0 .i did 1400% better then he did HOW IS THAT FAIR FIX IT.DONT LET NEWBS PLAY THE COMP IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSthe game was fun but i am quiting . bye
0;This game has the worst community in history worst than rust you get banned just about for saying anything to your competitors and Psyonix will not take any video evidence against hackers scammers exct. they will say to use the ingame report system that doesnt work. and then they willl ban you fro attepmting to ban a toxic I do not recommend
0;This game is very fun when the matchmaking is fair. Everything other than 1v1 is really unfair. You either get a really horrible guy on your team or you get a really good guy that handles the whole game by himself. I have also encountered many bugs and glitches in ranked. I think this is a fun chill game but i would not recommend playing competitive if you are going to play seriously.
0;Oh look it's another Bluehole developer. The game used to be good it's now full of micro transactions awfull servers and to top it off developers are now banning players based on reports alone without actually checking chat logs.YOU WILL BE BANNED FOR USING QUICK CHAT FUNCTIONS!! YOU WILL BE BANNED IF STREAMERS CRY!! After endless hours of playing this game this is the last straw for me i'm afraid. Time to uninstall what used to be my favourite game.
0;Changed from thumbs up to thumbs down which in all honestly should be a middle finger to the developers.Fun for a few matches but quickly gets frustrating in ranked since for some idiotic reason the developers decided to include arenas that differ a lot from the normal ones (Wasteland and Tokyo) where the bounces are way different.I guess internet never undersood real competition and why most sports are played with the exactly same arenas that are exactly the same.
0;I bought this game long ago and though it is very fun there's issues. I tried logging in for the first time in months. It has been updating in my library constantly and despite thought it faulted out This game has two things it needs to do play properly and have no bugs. It failes in this. If you want to play a fun game sure this is a great one if you can get it to download and play properly.
0;theres so much t for example if someone doesnt get connected to the game it just says reserved and then the match ends totally a waste of my ing time and this t ranking system demotes instantly after a loss and promotes after like 3 won games in a row. There is nothing new happening only new cases which is same different colour. Just cosmetics nothing else maybe a map redesign or a new map wow basically this game has been a waste of my 385 hours
0;"""Trash DLCs Psyonix_DevinGot banned for 1 day because I said """"kys"""" to a guy who was flaming me. The reason I got banned and he didn't is because he reported me and I didn't report him. Thanks Rocket League. On top of the recent lag on servers you add in this new crap. Might just stop playing RL again for a while. It seems that every couple of seasons they try to ruin the game with unneeded stuff. The crates are killing me too. TLDR the lads are slowly killing their game as they update it."""
0;After hours of playing I start getting error 71. This error prevents me from playing any matches because it freezes my computer and forces me to close the game. It is literally unplayable and there is no present solution for the error. These kinds of things should never happen especially in a game that costs money.
0;(so many hours...... for nothing) now if you are playing on keyboared you are ed because rocket league doesnt give any more sensetivity changes for keyboard....so if you have keyboard dont buy this gameand by the way the ranking system is too because now i am unranked after i didnt play rocket league for 1 day
0;This game is a game were it addicts you into openning crates paying more money for crates don't play this game its toxic community and they will ban you even if you go against the toxic people ing t game bans you from the game for being toxic can't even chat ban you they ban you from the game this game is to serious they need to fix its issues. Can't even make the game fun anymore no new modes except the trash new one that is so trash.
0;So I keep getting this message 'No servers online please try again later' when I try to search for a match in Rocket League. This happened since the last big update. Anyone knows a fix by any chance? Nothing seems to work and I am not able to play Rocket League anymore like this
0;"""Really dissapointed. Three times now that I get kicked out of a match and when I try to enter it says """"Connection timeout"""" and count as a ranked lost are you serious????? The three times we have been winning!!!!!!! Please fix this ASAP I support you guys and if this **** keeps happening I am going to quit playing this game."""
0;I love the very concept dynamics and customization of the game and its contents. Awesome graphics physics mechanics and gameplay. My only problem is thata person will have to spend a tonne of cash on decryptors items etc just to have their rides looking unique and decent. almost makes no sense at all. Points lost for that in my opinion.
0;Tbh I really enjoy this game especially with friends BUT in the server's current state it's virtually impossible to play online since you spend the majority of your time in a wall or stuck being slung around as the server tries to catch you up with its self. Wouldn't recommends anyone buy it until the servers are fixed.Actual game 7/10With server problems 1/10 (impossible to have fun)
0;It's an okay game but it's filled with arrogant people who smash people with coincidence so I think it's been sad to play it. People do not know that there is a Report system but nevertheless when you finally use it the Rocket League does not matter so people can just beat people in the game so others can get a worse play experience but beyond the nice gamei mean not smash but BOMB.
0;Started off a great game Lots of hours invested. However the recent update has ruined the game. Continual lag issues smurfing etc still apparent in the game despite the teams efforts.Major issues with server connection and i dont think i can return to this game until they solve these underlying issues.
0;This game is basically pinball. The presentation is good the servers are.... okay the balance of the game is fine it's a great game in those areas.Where this game falls down is the physics. Ball physics in particular is not very well done at all. Unfortunately physics is 90% of the game. I know why people like Rocket League it's short simple and easy to get into. Beyond that there is no depth to the game and it's really quite samey after a while.
0;its good for everybody who dont live in south east asia...the south east asiaa servers are horrible...they take bout 9 minutes just to find a match ....and half of the players dont connect to them....pysonix instead of fixing ur problems you are are just thinking of new ways to make money....introducing new crates...how many ing crates?....focus on fixing ur game ..especially south east asia side.......i used to love this game...i was obssesed with this...but now...i knida hate it....
0;The matchmaking is heavily rigged the ranking system is pure trash garbage and I have the heavy car / 1 second delay bug since 2 years and they will do nothing to help us (117 mega forum thread on their website with no response). 3500 hours and barely can compete with Diamonds noobs players. Psyonix is a very disgusting company and they don't deserve any of their success.
0;this game is alright as it is but there should not be a ban for saying bad words like wtf this game if im gonna be honest can be very rage indusing and if you're like me you will get mad and cus i got banned for cussing over voice comms so be careful what you say in game i guess and the creators of this game for making that a ban now i cant playEDIT Now it only chat bans you thank you Rocket League!
0;UPDATED REVIEW F%*K THIS GAMEThe matchmaking is a complete joke!It has this auto ban feature that even if you and your friends are playing you'll get banned for saying ANYTHING offensive to ANYONE!Not based on a player complaining just built into the system.I am done with crap like that cannot support it anymore!5/10
0;When you think you depend on your teammates in all FPS games then you come to Rocket League thinking that 3v3 you can do everything and see how actually useless players in your team are its unbelievable if you wanna play solo you are mad you will never be able to get past Platinum in 3v3 Solo 1v1 is great easily gone to Diamond but 3v3 you get players that literally started to play Rocket League 2 days ago Worst.Teamplay.Game.Ever. 0/10
0;This is a very fun game... WHEN IT WORKS. If you do not have the best computer I do not reccomend this game. When I try to play online or with my friends the lag makes the game in playable. I have had the game for a month it is has caused more agravation the fun.
0;"""Great game but you can get banned for benign trash talk (ie a simple """" you"""" after someone harasses you). Not sure if the bans are automatically generated based on reports or actually reviewed but it doesn't matter. Do not play online unless you are an extremely nice person"""
0;"""First of all I like this game very much its fun and cool to play. But this new """"progression"""" update is so buggy + servers are down and you can't play. I'm disappointed in this because i really like this game and everytime i want to play it says that servers are down. Not recommending until this game is fixed."""
0;This latest update/patch is absolutely horrible. Cars hitting the ball before they're even at the ball... frameloss and pings seem to be just randomly out of place and it's even creating 4v3 matches in 3v3... like what the hell.This game is pretty much dead to me right now until the next stupid overhaul. Nothing feels anything like it used to be all these months.
0;I used to enjoy this game. Fun time killer and when the season starts super competetive.However the community is toxic as hell. Further up the tiers you go the more salty people get. Almost no point in playing ranked unless you're playing with a friend because ultimately you'll end up with some who isn't actually playing for the joy of the game.
0;This game use to care about gameplay but now its just microtransaction and lobbies full of bugs. Really disappointed how this game has turned out. They use to say they will not be full of micro transaction but now thats all they are. Sucks to see a good game go to waste
0;"""The matchmaking is horrible it is actually a form of abuse. I had the game remove from my library because it has this power to put you in a """"one last game and this time I win"""" pattern. The grinding is so frustrating. Don't even think about ranking without a team. The developers don't never have and never will care about this."""
0;What a ing waste of time.Owned this game almost since release and they STILL haven't fixed the issues with rubberbanding.This game is literally unplayable unless you are a casual sucker. Get your ing together I can only recommend this game to you if you are under 12 / mentally challenged or both.
0;"""""""How many licks does it take to get to the center of this window?!"""" the average teammateHow can matchmaking be that ed up? From 1/4th the games not connecting a player to the ranking system being a joke you'd think the devs would take a break from releasing crates/hats to actually fix some problems."""
0;Game will ban you for no reason. Hands out 24 hour bans like candy apparently i dont even remember talking in general chat. Such a fragile society where you can get banned for 24 hours in a game for speaking in chat. Would highly advise to stay away from this game.
0;im done. after 25 loses i am done. maybe im not a good player but to lose 25 games is more the skills its the game. i enter every few days and lose first game. if its the team or if its something else but today was the last straw. i had a 51 percent wins and it dropped to 49.3. i wanted to love this game but i just cant.
0;get your sh*tty servers working with decent matchmaking. Sick of the constant bullsh*t with the damn rubberbanding matching with people 2 or three ranks higher than me and not going up divisions after 4 or 5 wins yet going down two divisions after 1 damn loss. Bloody hell.
0;Changed my review to negitive becuase the game has been crashing and instead of fixing the issue they give me a 5 min ban. I can not give a positive review on a game that refuses to let you play for issues out of your control. Their game crashes I get banned. No chance to re enter a match no way to submit what the issue is. Will NOT spend money on any more keys. Period.
0;I love this game! It's 100% skill based and really intense. Great! But and this is a big one your netcode for pc i S H ! T. It's been this way for as long as I can remeber no matter how stable and fast your connection is you from time to time experience slight time variation which can be devastating when ill timed.
0;The game's very fun at times but quite frustrating when it's broken. Basically everyone knows in this community the game's broken and badly coded. I'm D1 at the time of this review and everytime the game updates it breaks and most of the time they don't even fix it. Buy at your own risk.
0;This is t. Been waiting on cross platform all in year.... promised late july early august.... nothing.. THen the promis was late july early september.... still nothing... These developers don't know what they are doing. They are pouring themselves into a dying game that is fortnite.....
0;It's fun but it gets repetetive really quick. Also people using controller have advantage.There is Battle Pass microtransactions and lootboxes in a game that costs 20 already. That's a little bit too much for me. Also by now there are probably more types of lootboxes here than in CSGO.
0;"""I used to like the game but this game now is only trades farming hours and xp and then """"normal"""" players get ruined there scores because of master with 200 or even 100 hours pls dont farm train farming is not going to get u god at the game u will ruined for other peoples"""
0;This game makes money not only from selling the product itself but also from lootboxes and dlc. I'm not against it if that money is used to mantain the servers but that doesn't seem to be the case. Instead of fixing the damn servers they keep focusing in RLCS.
0;Game was sold to the Chinese government i deleted it from my profile and blocked all of their perms i granted watch out!!!!edit 12/12/18 game banned me for 10 minutes for leaving a game where the other team was afk and my team was scoring points on our own goal. This was my very first round back after several months.
0;It was a good game but now it just lacks in servers.. if you want a new game and you are thinking about RL.. you should rethink it... unless you see a headline of 10000 new servers for rocketleague... dont get it D if yesterday you could play RL with a normal ping.. doesnt mean that today its gonna be the same... peak hours in EU(not even peak) and magically my ping is 100+
0;"""""""Very interesting and highly addictive."""" &lt this was my initial review. but after years of torture i must say the game is excellent but i would not recommend it since the developers dont care about the bugs only about the boring new items and servers are the worst."""
0;UPDATE October 7th 2018.Icannot currently recommend this game because the servers are completely unreliable and the graphics are glitching. How about using some of that loot box money on providing stable servers?***Original reviewGreat game. It teaches you to be understanding and patient because there are no limits of stupidity that your random team mates won't break through.11/10 would scream at the screen again.
0;its okay i guessI said that that and then every match I've played in after I have lagged and lost most of them due to the inability to play the game. Servers are awful community is awful but at least you can buy a rocket pass that is just an obvious cash grab since it worked for Fortnite. Overall I'd rather eat rocks than play this game until the servers can hold a simple 1V1 game.
0;So first of all I have to say that I really love to play this game. When I saw it first i thought it looks pretty dumb but the moment I played it myself my mind changed on this game. However since they released the first Rocket Pass people have constant issues with the servers. I have to report like 1 in 2 servers because of issues. The bad stuff about this is the update was a few month ago so it seems they won't change anything about it so this game is kind of RIP
0;this game is the biggest waste of money i have ever in my life spent the devs punish you for defending yourself against toxic players in chat they give you no voice chat options all txt adn the amount of rage i get over matchmaking dont get me started this game is trash adn a ing money pit! i would rather go bankrupt funding EA than support this company that created this ing stupid game. the devs deserve to die for making a game this terrible there is absolutely no fun to be had!!!!
0;what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!waste of time but fun idk. just lost so ... idk
0;The game is good I got a few DLC cars as well but the SA servers are SO BAD they disconnect all the time package loss lag interrupted matches. Can't even play a competitive match cause of the penalty regarding mid game disconnect. I'm not going to recommend this game until Psyonix or whoever it needs to be addresses these issues. The game is NOT enjoyable at this point due to lots of lag. The brazilian community is also extremely toxic as they will ever be.
0;Easy to learn hard to master. Great price for a game of this standard. You'll always find a game as there are many people playing all the time. Easy game to get 100% achievements in however you need to purchase a few dlcs. 10/10 game would recommend.Update If you want to play online the servers are terrible. Will change back to thumbs up when the servers are fixed.Update again Added more acheivements still easy to get. Servers are better than they were but still cause plenty of issues.
0;Played this game since beta and it was passable then. As an OC player I've either faced overly long matchmaking waits or moved to another server and had to deal with extreme latency. There is no sign that this game is going to get any better as it has slowly declined since release and has drained my will to play it.
0;ROCKET FIX THIS BUG WHEN I ENTER IN ROCKET LEAGUE I CAN'T PLAY WITH CONTROLLER BECAUSE IT SAYS PRESS START TO JOIN AND I JOIN WITH ME AND WHEN I PLAY A GAME MY MONITOR IS SHOWING 2 PARTS WHY? HOW I CAN DISABLE IT I WANT TO PLAY 1V1 WITH THE CONTROLLER BUT THE CONTROLLER DIDN'T WORK IF I DON'T JOIN IN THE LOBBY WITH ANOTHER ME FIX THIS PLEASE !
0;No Joke this game gets every season.when it first came out it was great not too many smurfs not toxic no griefing etc.. but like everything else on steam few seasons down the line and u got trolls in comp smurfs in every match and toxicity levels through the roof. USED to be a good game NOW its
0;If you want a game that has developers putting in 100x more effort into creating cosmetics for their lootboxes or crates as they call them than they do stabilizing the same broken servers they have had since launch then look no further. There is no game out there that can quite create the sudden rubberband like ball movement like Rocket League. No game has ever wowed me with how well it simulates your car going completely through the ball as if you never existed.
0;This game is here to extract as much money out of people as possible all the while having a nasty element within it's player base. You are teased by rare crates that usually only give you crappy decals for cars you dont use/own and rule breakers generally get no punishment. Other than these issue the game is pretty okay albiet with poorly performing servers.
0;It's such a shame that a great game like this is brought down by its developers greed.Sponsored DLC's are probably the only items you should buy in this game SHAME on Psyonix for putting new cars only in lootboxes.I sincerely hope that either the EU or the US will come with new legislation to stop this lootbox craze. I want to play a game not slot machines!
0;The trading IS AWFUL TERRIBLE DISGUSTING BAD!!!! If you want to trade with unknown players be aware that you GOING TO BE SCAMMED!!! HORRIBLE! It's the third time I got scammed BECAUSE the developers fought it's a good idea to make trades that are big and have more than 20 items to TAKE 2 TRADES!! WHAT THE F***! JUST FIX THE GOD DAMN S***! DON'T TRUST ANYBODY! BUT I'M AND DID THAT! &gt ( the game is great and I'm just salty )
0;Well complete update of review..Game itself is fine can't complain but players base is terrible.Every 2nd match I would get a teammate who is definitely younger than 15 years of age cries about anyuthing blames team throws game.. It becomes boring to play as game starts to feel awful and pointless.If devs would actually somehow start paying attention to reports instead of just banning some people for using swearing words that would be nice. But meh will keep it as a negative for now.
0;The rocket league servers cause immense lag eventhough my internet connection speed (3mb p/s upload) and my specs (16gb ram and 3.4 GHZ intel processor) are sufficient to play rocket league. This issue arrises as soon as I connect to the rocket league servers and it does also happen in single player mode. I don't know what causes the issue but a good internet connection and good computer specs are certainly not sufficient in order to play this game without any issues even in single player mode.
0;"""you start off with a car with some boost... and you play soccar with these machines... anyway games pretty fun when your playing (EZ) people but then you play those people that say """"EZ"""" once you hit that level cap when you play those people just delete the game its no longer fun LOL"""
0;"""The game itself is quite fun and would recommend if only it wasnt for the toxic community it has. Every other game if something is not going your team mates way youre being told they """" ed your mum"""" or to """"go myself."""" this even counts in non ranked where wins dont matter the childish behaviour of a large amount of players just sours the experience of the game"""
0;"""Its a good game but I would like it if the """"Searching playings around your skill"""" while you're finding a match actually ment that. I always get like veteran teammates and either legend or rocketter opponents. This makes my winning persentage 32.5%. Ive been playing for almost 2 years and Im only a expert. So I'd like that to be changed or atleast select what rank you would like to go agenst or just pick the same rank as you. Maybe even just... Idk... Find players around your skill.."""
0;After 2 years optimization still sucks and I started to think that developers doesn't give a fk anything about it much more than doing silly missions on survivor pass for this sht..Could you please stop being lazy fckin wake up and try to make something about it?
0;This game would be golden if you were unable to talk to the other team by default and I really just have the chat on cause I still have hopes of finding someone cool...but no.There is no respect no maturity no sportsmanship nothing!This game is just toxic as this community is toxic as the only thing people know how to do properly is trash talking each other.Basically Good Game Super Community (I guess if I went back to LoL I would find nicer folks nowadays)
0;Core game is amazing. Loot system is BS.Based on the way it's going new buyers would be better off waiting for it to go FtP since that looks like the direction the game is headed.Negative review is for crates as well as the dev's tendency to release updates that are buggy AF. Otherwise game is awesome.
0;It is a really great game! But there are a few problems...&gt cross platform play that makes you play with random console users (even switch)&gt lack of server upkeep so matches are lagging out more&gt ranked system doesn't match you with people of your own skill&gt loot boxes are a big thing
0;this game is terrible. the devs. the community. trash ranks that reward people with things they dont deserve everything between plat diamond is a how of ballchasers and carried gold trash who cant play the game effectively as a team. i literally hope the developers of this game die.
0;Fun game. for some reason my Xbox One controller won't work with (only this) game anymore. I tried re installing game/controller verifying game files. Nothing works. I have only ever used an Xbox controller with this game so not sure what's up. Downvote until fixed.
0;Fun but there are some problems. Need to force players to play the tutorial before playing against other humans. voice chat is implemented... but not much point since it works like garbage. servers get weird isses all the time. the afk issue (bots) is thankfully reduced
0;I will give it a No because this game isnt fun its just a competition you cant laugh with others since the voice chat is broken the matchmaking is pretty much a lot smurfs who say that they are not smurf they are just some guys that have 10 h in this game and became super good at it .
0;Stupid game made by a handicapped company. It feels exactly like a Hot Wheels game because its a copy of the Hot Wheels games. Don't buy it you spend 20$ for nothing. Its just a scam. Don't buy it. Don't look at the store page and if you do buy it refund immediately.I don't recommend this trash game made by useless peoples.This game is made by Brain Dead Inc. not PsyonixDon't even try to look at your steam wallet to buy when you are viewing the store page
0;Many thanks to Psyonix! I had an interrupted internet connection that forced me to minimize the game and re connect to the Internet. After doing this the message indicated that the match was over and the next attempt to enter the match received a 3 time ban in a row within 3 days for 24 hours due to accidental transfer of the cable from the Internet. Only regrets spending 412 hours in this game.Ps You have great servers in the game ... zero delays!
0;Match making is a ing joke. You will most likely get connected to the 0 4 match with 25sec left or even tho it has so ing massive playerbase you will play with/against bots. Recently they are more focused on adding hilarious pass thing than on fixing the game.Many updates later (including the one enabling the absolute cross play between every single platform) it still remains exactly the same.
0;WE NEED BETTER SERVERS IN THE EU!WE ARE PAYING FOR THIS GAME AND ARE CONSTANTLY PLAYING WITH &gt 150ms PING!GET YOUR $H1T TOGETHER!FFS.. I can't block any enemies cuz they're already 10 meters further away from me.UNACCEPTABLE!(5ms ping to other game servers. Psyonix fix this!)
0;"""Uhm..I never experienced so much stress and anger in my entire life like I did in this garbage """"game"""".This s from Psyonix are totally out of control and they killed this game.This game was fun to play before but after you see that they support the toxicity in this game by adding the +2 points for touching the ball once you start thinking """"This game it's wort buying?""""Answer No."""
0;Just to be clear I do enjoy the game and believe it is a great and refreshing idea. Just wasted 4 hours for the second time now to build a base and have vehicles just to lose everything because i fall through the map. Going to put this one back on the shelf and hope its better in a few months.
0;"""The game had plenty of potential. If they rolled back versions to when it was a decent game playable &amp fun I'd give it a thumbs up but it stinks now &amp only seems to reek more every time I play.Dev's aren't done ruining this title by a long shot. I'd suggest watch """"Let's play"""" and Twitch after the full release. Early access only promises to be more of the same worse than what it was before it got ruined."""
0;"""Please take the game back to 0.10.5.0 that was the last time I could play the game.I played 1426 hours up to 0.10.5.0 and spent 3 hours trying to get past """" LOADING SOLAR SYSTEM"""" on 1.0 and your game counted it as play time.Somebody owes me a refund and steam will not refund after 2 hours of p lay.If I am no longer able to play this game ( ASTRONEERS ) I will have to give it 22 million thumbs DOWN. AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO MY WORST ENEMY. thank you for your time"""
0;Single player is fun but online has been utterly ruined by hackers/modders. If you want to enjoy online....play console. There I said it. Gratz modders and hackers you have made the console version of this game better than PC. PC it is impossible to find a lobby without hackers and modders running around with god mode killing everyone taking away your guns crashing your game due to spawn limits. GTA online is total crap.
0;"""After more than 1000 hours 3 shark cards invested no mod or exploit used ever I was banned account reset everything lost no explanation given ticket closed by support """" banning decisions are final and may not be appealed""""Grand theft indeed of your time and money."""
0;Rockstar is banning players for playing the game without any cheat's or mods just banning for no absolute reason at all. My friend got a 30 day ban the other day with no reason attached just all stats reset and all money cars and properties gone. Do not buy this or any Rockstar game ever!

0;This game has been terrible since the very beginning.&gt Sharkcards&gt Grindfest&gt ONLINE content restricted from being in singleplayer&gt Any glitch involving money is patched out within a day but every other bug and exploit doesn't get patched out for months up to over a year&gt Empty promises
0;Take Two Interactive's shutdown GTA modding tool OpenIV..that's harsh!!! never played online and i never will. the only reason i buy this game is because of mods.they should embrace mods not remove them. i know its revenue in GTA5 online but seriously. the people paying additional money on GTA online are not the people that are gonna use OpenIV.
0;REVIEW PART 2 ELEKTRIK BOOGALOOSo Rockstar just went ultra shaddy on their Steam Summer Sale prices. Not only is it still $60 (With a nice little in game currency that isn't worth it at all) you cannot refund the game with this purchase. Why is that? The reason is that if you buy the game now which comes with that in game money you now can't refund your game. Don't buy the game during the summer sale if you're not sure that your PC can run it at a state you want it to.
0;Gta V used to be really fun though the latest updates have made online unplayable unless you already are rich due to the riddiculous imbalance and toxic community. If you want to even stand a chance at making any money people tell you to trick the server into thinking you're lagging to be in a solo session without greifers which ruins the point of multiplayer. Honestly they threw balance out the window in favor of pushing microtransactions the quintessential part of any modern game...
0;if i want to have this mutch work just to play a f*cking online game i rather download a pirate copy i can't play online is full of bugs sometimes i can't connect other times it kicks me out i dont kwon that to do when i was plaing a not original copy of this game i doesn't have this mutch work to play it i do not recomend
0;Product received for free. Cars in the latest update cost $60 each. If you want them all expect to spend upwards to $500.This game has turned into Grand Purchase Auto / Grind Theft Auto. They've totally ruined one of my favorite games on Steam. I'm done.Edit Looks like I've been permanently banned from GTA O despite never having modded let alone played the game in the past 3 months. Really R*?
0;After the insane ammount of money you have to spend to actually experience the updates well you do experience them by being destroyed by people with overpowered vehicles I didn't think I could be any more mad at Rockstar. But they somehow did it. I never thought they would be dumb enough to ban singleplayer mods.
0;Love this game but Take Two can go itself with restricting mod usage in SINGLEPLAYER. They don't even add new content to singleplayer. So much awesome content graces the lands of GTA Online but none of it reaches singleplayer and if you wanna spawn content from Online in singleplayer using mods you're ed now.
0;I played the game for 12 houers and got banned for no reason I would not recomend to buy this game if you dont want to get your money stolen+edit After talking to Rockstar suport via the phone they told me it is no chans theire banning system makes mistake and i will have to wait out the 30 days After waiting 2 days i now have gotten unban whitout any reason or information why.
0;So I've played around 400hourish on this game mostly online. Loved the game even when there were crazy updates. I never cheated if i needed money I bought shark cards. I've been playing PUBG recently and I came to play GTA again for the first time in 4months. On the login screen it said Rockstar took 9mil from me. Seriously? Not going to play GTA for a long time
0;142 hours on recordFOV MOD + SINGLEPLAYER Trainer + ReShade BANNice move Rockstar.I even preordered your 2013 game at a ridicule price to show you how much the PC relase was important but no let's screw the key selling point of our game to sell in game transactions to support the awful peer to peer laggy multiplayer that this game has.Let's wait until the 16th when my ban will expire to evaluate better the game
0;It's bad enough that there's so little extra put in to the pc release or that your full screen is glitchy. So people were nice enough to make an FOV fix for that and what happens? They get banned for having that mod installed. It feels poorly optimized for PC and it is honestly really depressing that you guys are doing so little to help the community and so much to ruin it as well.Please Rockstar change your policies and have the community make a great game even more amazing.
0;I won't be buying another Rockstar game ever. I bought this game for the ability to mod Singleplayer... And guess what? People are getting banned for playing SINGLEPLAYER using mods.There is various things a mod can help do.. Such as make movies and such and Rockstar is messing it up.
0;The only reason I'm playing this game at this point is because I got it for free from a friend. Every odd game I join has at least one hacker in it and the last one simply erased all the guns and ammunition in my possession. If I'd paid money for this I'd be down R*'s throat at this point.
0;Multiplayer is filled with hackers You can't do anything in Online because everything costs millions of dollars which you will only get if you buy sharkcards (keep in mind the game costs 60$ to begin with) Getting tons of errors upon loading into the Online version Loading time will take up to 7 8 minutes after that you will start to question if you will actually get into the server Boring world with not much to do other than small activities like tennis/golf etc.
0;On the behalf of OpenIV I can no longer recommend this game. Mods make GTA on the PC GTA. If Rockstar does not understand this than they really do not know how to conduct business. Sorry Rockstar your actions really made it clear that you are only in the game for profit not for the dedication of your customers.
0;I put a lot of time in this game and in the past I would have recommended it however there is too much grinding and everything is so damn expensive and you either grind for hours buy microtransaction shortcuts hack or just stop playing. I picked the latter option.Singleplayer is excellent though. If you want to play only for the singleplayer wait for the game to go on sale.
0;The modding is one of the most attractive ways to bring T2 more consumers. Now they received the consumers from openiv and totally abandon it. They are not appreciated about what the openiv have done in near a decade past. I recommend you not to play this game. Pogchamp and smiling face emote.
0;Once one of the most mod able games that could turn your game into a much more better game.Now it's one of the most jackshit games i have ever played since they removed modding do not recommend after they took action against Modding modding kept this game alive apart from using it in Multiplayer.From everything is possible to all is limited.
0;Rockstar and take 2 are bunkch of s to their community members. The only care about bottom line and gaming needs passion. Is GTA5 fun? Could be. But have you no principals and would send your money to such nazi company? Personally not even pirating their
0;Take Two R*'s publisher decided to Take Two fingers and show them to OpenIV and the entire modding community simply so that they can force people into GTA O and buy microtransactions. I've got 2 copies of GTAV PC retail and digital I've probably played 200 hours in game but due to Take Two's incompetence DO NOT BUY GTA VEdit OpenIV appears to be back but that doesn't change my verdict on Take Two and you still shouldn't support their shady practices.
0;Such a great game with lasting potential ruined by greedy corporate talking heads that have no idea why the game was so successful and the series so long lived and long loved.OpenIV was a great tool to keep the game alive long after the devs moved on to make the next great thing but now it's gone and noone should bother wasting money on the next cashgrab.
0;This game is the ultimate sandbox and opened up modding to a community of people who have loved it for many years. Recently Take Two shut down Open IV which is most of the mods for this game. We need to show Take Two that this is not right. This game is excellent but the company in charge is not respecting the community they built. This disrespect is frowned upon and I would not recomment this game.Sign this and maybe we will send a message.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;what about a better experience on the online version ??? nooooo let s stop the modding community and ban legit players and let the damn hackers roaming free .. company only cares about consoles we are the MOTHER ING PC MASTER RACE WE stand up for what it s right !!!!! and you rockstar
0;ive played over 200 hours of this game and the devs said they would always allow modding on the game. And now they've effectively eliminated modding so they can prop up their pay to win online 'game'. Get rekt take 2 and rockstar congrats on taking EA's crown
0;Take Two has taken it upon themselves to drive their game into the ground. Its going well so far.Also I've played over 600 hours of this game and I dont see why they felt the need to send out cease and decists to modders after all this time or even at all. Please fix.
0;I'd normally give it a positive review but I am sick and tired of being used as a cash cow. Microtransactions fine fair enough. But now offline modding tools are being taken away from us all while online continues to suffer from hackers that don't use said modding tools? Screw this. No one's stealing anything by using modding tools it's just obvious they want to lock down their product to milk out as much cash as they can. Well I'm one frankly tired customer. Get your together.
0;Absolutely fantastic game. Wonderfully written story amazing gameplay beautiful world to explore.I really think this is one of the best games of all time and I really wish I could recommend it to anyone who plays PC but it's missing one tiny little thing and I think a small handful of people out there might feel slightly disappointed that it's not there THE ABILITY TO MOD THE ING GAME
0;No mods no fun. Online ing blows unless you got buddies to play with. Long story short got banned b/c of a third party chat usage (Discord is apparently cheating) they never resolved my ban. Rockstar and you.Edit I got my account back but Rockstar still a bumass niBBa though.
0;So if you play GTA V for the single player it's a pretty decent purchase.Buuuuut Rockstar and Take Two decided to shut down a modding platform in a futile attempt to stop hacking. Given how Rockstar and Take Two act like money hacks for GTA O are like walking in to their safes and stealing money I'm pretty sure that the C&amp D was to preserve their shark card t which surprisingly people are actually dumb enough to buy.In short you Rockstar.

0;"""Great game overall until Rockstar banned my for a FOV mod and modding a couple million to make a video about and to test out all the cars and see which ones I like best since not all cars in multiplayer you can get in singleplayer.Rip years of waiting rip $60. I see no support in rockstar for PC. They release their """"definitive version"""" and all I see is a money ."""
0;Forces you to use Social club as the access route to the game which renders using this game on a second account even with shared libraries useless. Wasted money dumb system. If you were able to maybe UNLINK steam accounts from Social club so that you're not locked to one account even if you have access to the game on another this would be a good game. Tl DRGame is a good game system and owners are not. Would not purchase on PC.
0;I'm standing up for the people that enjoyed modding this game although I didn't do it myself I find this a stain on creative freedom and the hours of fun people threw into this game. Look at Skyrim.. its still alive because of modding... Terminating this would've been a lot less bad had you come up with a steamworkshop or some other solution rather than just lazily killing it!
0;Jebaited TAKE TWO OUTDATED Jebaited ROCKSTAR OVERRATED Jebaited NO MODS INSTATED Jebaited OPENIV DEVASTATED Jebaited LONG WE HAVE WAITED Jebaited NOW WE JEBAITED JebaitedBut seriously screw you guys. You copyright claim a program for singleplayer mods yet don't do anything about rampant cheaters.
0;only expect to have fun on the online if you hack to give yourself money or enjoy a mobile phone level of grindor if you like shelling out 100$ for one sports carthe story mode is really good thoughi hope red dead redemption 2 doesn't end up like this (it looks like i haven't played recently but i play a lot on my ps4
0;PC version is dead? or was it just me? i don't want to recommand it at the same time i do cause i like gta 5 but nobody was playing jobs and nobody was in the 3 lobbies i joined the console version is most likely the most active still but considering the amount of reviews for this game about getting randomly banned must have killed the community.
0;Was alright till the banning of single player mods to push their online mode so they could sell microtransaction shark cards.DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you can hack in money from someone otherwise it has the same free to play grind mentality and you will spend hours grinding just to have fun.
0;lately i felt the online was relatively clear of cheaters (compared to last year)but the ban system is completly borked. was banned out of nowhere just keeping to myself doing bunker sales.no point in buying or playing a game that at the drop of a hat can undo all your efforts and feel nothing.
0;I have played this game for quite some time already I enjoy playing online as well as offline I have never used mods in this game but from the moment Take 2 decided to ban mods from GTA V I can no longer recommend this game until this situation is completely resolved.
0;I can't support GTA anymore. Their shady business practices in GTO have put me off ever playing again. It forces you into a horrible grind that makes it difficult to even have any fun. Shark Cards aren't even worth buying. That is if they don't ban you for buying one and suddenly having huge amounts of money.
0;these guys are horrible people they sent a cease and desist to a group of modders whos primary goal was to enhance your solo play experience. due to this they can now legally come after anyone for using mods on their game. Not just a ban but a real world legal issue. If you mod their games or have modded their games they could attempt legal action against you. Take two interactive has made themselves a clear threat to their community.
0;"""Been playing since release on ps3 then transfered the accout to pc when it came out. boucht shark cards along the way and stuff. Had a great time. Auto joined a session turns out there's a hacker in it I leave the lobby and search a new one. You have been banned...... sure. Asked """"support"""" but they won't help anyone......"""
0;Rockstar and TakeTwo don't care about anything but their bottom line. I've put 1100+ hours into this game and have recommended it to many people. I won't be buying RDR or any future Rockstar/TakeTwo game nor will I recommend any to anyone ever again. What killed my motivations for playing? Simple greedy developers.

0;Ok i'll admit i've had a lot of fun with this game and its' multiplayer however since the modding aspect of the game has been completely pushed out and they've recently released the Gunrunning update that only caters to richer players I simply have to say this F*ck you Rockstar and Take 2 you absolute f*cking c*nts. You've ruined the game for a majority of pc players and I hope you're happy you microtransaction f*cking w*ores.
0;Here's a thought Rockstar try banning modders. Essentially they will either keep buying the game which puts more money into your pockets or they'll stop modding which keeps the community happy. Eventually modding will slow down as modders won't want to keep paying out for the game and that's a plus for everyone.
0;This is one of the few games ive re bought multiple years in a row due to they kept re releasing it on new consoles followed by pc The multiplayer was fun but I took pride in the singleplayer modding like i have since san andreas. Taking away a feature that didnt effect the online preformance of the game or the micro transactions is just arrogant and takes almost all of the fun replayability of the single player there was away. I expected better. I was wrong.
0;"""I had this game on xbox 360 it was great. Got it on Pc yea it was great.... Until last weekend when I logged on to find my main character since day 1 (october 2013 or whatvever) gone.

0;Take 2 choice to reMove modding is beyond me. They would spit on all their customers for their own benefit but not know how to spit. I rather not play a game where a literal pigeon can call the police on me because it's alive.

0;Maybe if Rockstar had developed single player story expansions like they did for GTA IV(and planned on doing for GTA V) I would give a better review. Instead they coast on GTA online sales of cash cards and don't seem to give a about people who don't play online anymore. GIVE US MORE STORY PLEASE and let the modders do what they do to keep the community alive.
0;Go ahead If you're looking to play the stories or add some mods like the characters skins vehicles etc.If you're play with some friends that you knew well. Do jobs etc. It's fun but don't ever cheats it ruined the happiness of the game.ButDon't if you want to play the multiplayer alone. It's really really ed up. Bunch of cheaters random acts of players very noisy room etc. Go with the Playstation or Xbox version. I'd rather play the GTA SA Multiplayer
0;"""Single player is great but it you want access to all the extras you need to play online. That's where the nightmare begins. People shooting you from 10 miles away kids using """"orbital"""" weapons and other crazy pay for upgrades means you won't stand a chance of having a decent game without encountering the type of players that enjoy annoying others. There is no way to deal with this so I can't recommend playing this for anything other than single player."""
0;Yeah they ban people from the online version who have never used mods and are strict anti modder and then do not even review why the system did it. well theres 3 years down the hole for i and 5 of my crew. We were a group who reported modders as part of our crew creedo too. nothing but a complete letdown. and when they unbanned us after the set time they immediatly rebanned all of us permenantly without reason. Rockstar and Take Two you can go yourself with a hot iron spiked rod sideways.
0;I bought this twice once on Xbox 360 and once here.. i've paid 120 british pounds to take 2 the company that owns this game i bought it on xbox due to the hype.. and i bought it on PC for the mods which they're now taking away from us.. i cant refund this but i'll leave it a bad review untill they realise they're wrong to try and take away our mods. because lets be real they wont do till the media kick off about it
0;This game is trash. The Anti Cheat that they have right now is tollaly trash. A lot of legit players got ban for no reason at all. If you're looking for open world game I do not recomend this game at all. You're gonna waste your money cuz you're gonna get ban in the first hour of the game. Rockstar ruined their game.
0;I always come to GTA with really good mood to drive my cars around and do funny stuff but end up leaving the game after an hour thinking how can a game be. Honestly if you're looking at the reviews looking to buy the game DONT DO IT. The game is so ed up and what's even more? Rock ing star. Most ed up and greedy game company I know.Around 450 hrs played and sadly going to play couple hours more in future...
0;"""the new update came out i started the game up and i got a message saying """"your GTA online dollars has been adjusted by $8 498 918""""Half of my vehicles are missing and all of my apartment upgrades have been removed.Almost everyone has lost some money from this update.Is this their way of making people buy shark cards?"""
0;I bought this game for 40. yeah a bit pricey but I knew I'd enjoy it. I have spent about 4hrs in GTA online it doesn't float my boat. I have spent alot of time in single player yes using mods and I love them.but T2 said NO. This game is nothing to me without mods. That's the experience I want it for.
0;Been playing it for a while.. and today i got placed in the bad sport section.. just after i logged in in the evening.. Appartenly hackers can now use you as a fall guy if they want so you get stuck with a bad sport rating.. and a idiotic level and R* doesnt seem to be handeling any tickets about it.. So.. dont buy.. and if you do.. stay out of public lobby's before you get placed with bad sports for nothing.
0;Single player is good multiplayer became a pretty bad experience. The community is full of trolls and hackers. The content is only available if you pay a lot or grind endlessly while trying to avoid others(the trolls) in free play. It is no longer good for casual players.
0;Worst customer support ever. If you need it be prepared for automatic generic answears and not having your issue investigated.Don't buy anything from Rockstar.Pior servi�o de atendimento ao cliente que ja vi. Se tiver problemas com sua conta ou o jogo se prepare para receber respostas automaticas sem que seu problema seja investigado.N�o compre nada da Rockstar.

I will never buy another R* TakeTwo game."""
0;I bought GTA just for the online and it's one of the worst mistakes ever. First I was banned for using mods I admit. After uninstalling the mods and starting fresh people reported me and I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON AT ALL. A hacker then dropped me money and I got banned.PLEASE dont buy this game on the PC unless your buying for single player.Buy it if its on a huge special like 80% off
0;Great story and characters coupled with very detailed recreation of LA and covered with excellent satire. On the other side unfortunately there is mediocre Online part with boring grindfest free but half DLCs and lobbies filled with mindless trigger happy kids. Only on sale for half price.
0;At online mode you have been banned from the GTA Online from no reason again and again.I have never use anny mod never cheat never interfear anybody in online mode.I have been banned from no reason then i inform back to support team and then...They iggonred to solve this issued. Manay people have been banned from no reason. (you can check it)I am not sure this is the strategy for sell this game again for the player have been banned.
0;"I am currently wasting my time in this game i suggest nobody should play this game until its fully fixed and i hope the developers read this cause their game is sh*t espacially ""PLAYERUNKNOWN"" Himself.Spending a whole year adding bullsh*t in this game and not caring about solving it's problems.it's still the same nothing changed."
0;Rockstar is anti modding there is nothing more to say. Why the would you be this anti modding? They are banning people for using a FOV fix since the FOV is locked to max 75 which is unplayed. And they are banning people for using Mods in Single Player. move Rockstar.
0;I do not recomend this game to a person who has low blood pressure or risk of heart attacks becouse this ing game will induce the out of both of those! I have validated the ing vfiles to this game over 20 times to still have the same failure in the en files. But Steam and Rockstar fail to provide me with the proper files to allow me to play this 70$ ING GAME! what a waste if u enjoy your money and time spent gameing do not purchese this game!
0;Take Two issued a cease and desist to OpenIV a core mechanic mod that was the lifeblood of many GTA4 and GTA5 mods. By issuing the C&amp D (nearly a decade after it first came to market) they have crippled vast swaths of the modding scene.Rockstar responded to the wave of negative press saying that it was blocked because of its involvement in recent malicious multiplayer hacking.(OpenIV is a single player only mod)(GTA online has always been a hacked to hell mess. This has not changed)....
0;Rockstar wanted online player to buy shark card they make the prices of the items in game very expensive you have two option to buy waht you want go buy a shark card or grind all day which you will make 800k/hour+ they make the megalodon shark card to only go 15% on sale now back then it was always 50%
0;Disgusting mutated growth of what Grand Theft Auto used to be. The online is more unbalanced then my hemorrhoids. all Pay to win If not then grind the next two/three months to get near your friends lvl. Then see all your cash disapear on the purchase of one car.Can't wait for 'Golden Horse cards' in RDR2 so I can get my Golden Spurs and Over powered as gun that only rich kids and people with no life can afford. R* can eat my crusty a s s hole.
0;I loved this game for 5 year but this week i was banned for no reason i could not email or complane about this.I love this game but when you get banned for reasons like being hacked or no reason or if it is just a mix up there is no way to get unbanned.
0;Singleplayer is Great one of the better games out there mods are awesome but only if they didn't ban mods for more Micro transactions in multiplater also the multiplayer scene is Really bad most loading screens take ages for everyone. also the price of everything in multiplayer is based on you buying the money with actual money. worst thing that could have happened to this Amazing game series.
0;It is absolutely disgusting what this game has turned into especially the multiplayer. And now with the cease and desist of a major mod used by many I can whole heartenly tell everyone that this game is not and probably never will be worth it. The same will likely be said for any future game that Take Two the owner company of Rockstar publishes.
0;So Take Two is shutting down Open IV in order to protect their garbage online money printer game mode despite Open IV not contributing to any mods that affect Online and Rockstar saying in the past that they support Open IV's contributions to their games and players. Quite honestly this game has had a pretty history in regards to its Online but this really is the pinnacle of both stupidity and greed. this game and the people who produce it.
0;A single player game turned multiplayer turned massive cash grab. Take Two wants you online so they can drain your wallet in a pay to win environment and thus decided to remove mods from singleplayer. I'm surprised they haven't outright removed singpleplayer the root of all evil that prevents them from earning more money.
0;Take Two has issued a cease and desist for OpenIV effectivly making all mods illigal to take players to their GTA Online where hackers can play without worries and victims are being banned. They just want to bring people to their online so that they could buy sharkcards that they can get more than the billions they already got from this...don't buy until they revert this decisionEDIT Seems like Take Two retracted their cease and desist but I'm still doubtful
0;I bought this game to play Los Santos Police Department First Responder.Take Two has decided to Cease and Desist the OpenIV team responsible for making mods possible.Take Two has killed modding in GTA V singleplayer just to protect their Shark Card profits.This is extremely unacceptable and I'm never buying a Take Two product again.Modding makes games survive years beyond when they should be garbage tier.Stop killing modding.
0;Good game... with messy poor optimization insultingly terrible technical supports made of automated replier and clueless staffs. Their solution to uncontrollable occurences of cheats and false anti cheat bans is to threaten good modders with lawsuits.
0;Game sucks. Not allowed to enjoy the game you paid for without the fun nazis over at Take Two getting their precious money. Mods made your lackluster game fun. Made it easier to deal with your terrible load times and ridulous hanging on load screens. Wheres that DLC for single player you stated you were bringing out YEARS AGO?Nah as long as players buys your shark cards like idiots you're laughing.. 
0;Rockstar and Take Two have shown all they care about is GTA Online's horrible microtransaction system by removing many of the abilities to exclusivel mod SINGLE PLAYER. This is totally insane. The economic system in Online is also horrible requiring tens of hours of boring repetitive gameplay of the same mission which give you the most money to get a good vehicle. you Rockstar and you Take Two.
0;I've literally just bought this game went through story mode and after 50 hours in online i've got banned with thousands of other players because of some dev crap that ruined so many accounts at onceAnd the funniest thing is that Rockstar doesn't even care about this they are just pretending there isn't a problem1000 banned accounts out of 10
0;I like many others have been banned in the March 2018 ban wave. Rockstar gives no form of appeal system. I won't try to convince you if I'm guilty or not. But there is no way that 100% of all bans are justified. Rockstar needs to change their policy in order to help those wrongly accused of modding. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE OKAY WITH WASTING YOUR MONEY.
0;"""What in god's name is the point of taking the censorship of online chat to such an absurd degree as to restrict the use of the word """"eggplant"""" (which I didn't even know was a slur until this game told me as such) in a game where you murder people rob banks deal drugs and huff gasoline to pass the time?This is almost as silly as it is frustratingly pointless."""
0;"""Can't just sit here and not say something.... by taking away single player mods you're silencing the the creative community and killing what keeps games fresh and fun. GTA needs mods by the """"overwhelmingly negative"""" reviews in the past week I think others agree. SAVE OPEN IV https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv"""
0;Thanks Take Two Interactive.EDIT Not taking this down or changing my review. Dont get me wrong this game is a masterpiece (from my time in singleplayer) however Take Two screwed up royally by trying to get rid of singleplayer modding. So I'm keeping this review as negative as a reminder of that.
0;Take Two is actively trying to destroy the modding community. If this is allowed what's to stop other developers from doing the same in order to force their customers into using microtransactions to unlock new content or to level up faster? This must be stopped here and now. Rockstar and Take Two are multi billion dollar companies. They don't need more money.
0;Dear Rockstar/Take TwoIf you are unable to ensure that no script kiddies destroy the online habitat/enviroment of your game then this is the problem of your security architecture and not the problem of people who spend their free time to help other people have better gaming experiences through modding your (offline )product.
0;"""i once had like 14 mil until they """"corrected"""" it. then i used a lot of time to get almost 1 mil then they """"corrected"""" it again. DON'T BUY THIS IT'S REMOVES EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE I USED SEVERAL WEEKS TO GET THE 1 MIL AFTER THEY TOOK MY 14 MIL AND THEY REMOVED MY 14 MIL. (by """"corrected"""" i mean they took it and gave it the label """"corrected"""")"""
0;With Rockstar destroying the modding scene for this game which has been keeping their multiplayer up for a decade and also enacting this horrible P2W model inside a $60 game in a attempt to squeeze out as much money from the consumer as possible I can no longer recommend this game to anyone other than the singleplayer. Rockstar Has went full EA with this title. Be Warned.I give Grand Loading Screen Empty Server V a 2/5
0;If you're 13 and have your parents credit card ready then this is the game for you.If you're a modder with a good mod menu then this game is for you.You will eventually get a money reset / account ban just by being in a public lobby. The cash dropping / cheating is everywhere and the only punishment is to ban YOU not the modder )Enjoy your ban and remember! Get a good menu if you want to play without a ban )
0;Gameplay is repeadative and is hard to enjoy for a long time. Shark cards are being pushed hard because 12 year olds with their mom's credit card are a feccking money whale. Tons of modders.I liked the game I was just getting back into it and then I got an email from R* saying that I breached their EULA. I could not access the game for 30 days and all my progress was deleted. I do not recall a moment where I modded or glitched money or anything else.Good day and good riddance.
0;Be careful purchasing or buying this game. They suspend you and reset your character after 4 years of gameplay for no reason. They cannot tell you why or what you did. The suspension and resetting of your character is final and you cannot appeal it.GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors including modding in GTA Online exploiting or abusing game mechanics manipulating protected game data and code or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience.
0;i really like this game. the game is very good and really awesome but i don't recommend it. why? because hackers. i played the gta online and holy fk i hate finding hacker that took every single weapon you had. maybe i can just buy it again but do i fkin look i can afford buying everything again? for newbies it is very frustrating even for the people who is level above 100.you loose alot of money too because the hacker keep exploding you.
0;When i last played i loved this game it was GTA V.I just installed it again after a long break jumping on with a few friends do some CEO missions then whilst getting the shipment a bunch of flying missile wielding moto bikes attack us whilst we are trying to deliver a van..If i wanted to play Saintsrow i would have bought Saintsrow if this is the direction GTA is going then the GTA future will be one i dont invest any time into (
0;I have yet to be hit by the recent mass ban wave that's caught innocents in it's line of sight due to not launching the game to play online since the issue happened. Rockstar has said nothing about the false bans that have happened or if they will end up reverting them whenever this issue is fixed. Regardless anyone banned will have all of their money and progress wiped that they have spent time grinding out to get and the lack of communication on their part is unacceptable.
0;The story mode's pretty fun and the online mode is sometimes preferable to ebola. However if you're a cheap who wants R* to starve and won't buy at least one Whale Shark Card a month you might as well just pirate the and stop pretending you're not a disgusting thief.
0;I haven't even played this game in a long time nor used any mods on it but I still hate to see Take Two messing with the modding community of the game.Create a better anti cheating system rather than going after the modders who are just seeking to improve the singleplayer experience.
0;Grand Theft Auto Online has been nothing but a cash grab for some time now and I'm glad people are finally starting to stand up against it. GTA has always been a game about freedom and doing whatever the hell you want and Take Two have all over the playerbase for a long time now. The removal of mods does not impact me in the slightest but I'm tired of being treated like a talking wallet.
0;After 2 years nothin' changed expect the few ty wheels and expensive useless offices what you can buy from sharkcard of course.....RGSC keeps lagging all the time...Horrible loading times.....Playtime would be 75% Loading/25% Playing with cheaters....
0;"""I can say without hesitation that Grand Theft Auto V is one of my favorite games in my library. I've sunk a good chunk of my time into it and I would have recommended it to anyone who asked me about it that is until they start taking your in game cash away via """"Account Adjustments"""". Now all Rockstar wants is your REAL cash. Anyone want a Shark Card? I thought not..."""
0;Single player is great.Online is terrible. The load times are insane. Hard to find players for any game mode everyone just around in free roam. Hackers are abundant tho not always harmful. The cash grind is insane everything is expensive and it's intentionally designed this way to make Shark Cards (cost real money) more appealing. I don't hate all microtransactions but GTA Online has the most absurd pricing for them I've ever seen.
0;I loved this but Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive have proved countless times that they do not care about the community all they care about is money and recently they basically said modding is illegal so they killed a ton of their fan base despite all of this they change nothing they stay the same and it works because some of us let it work.
0;Take Two is lawyering up and kills modding communities to satisfy their own greed by selling mods and frustrating online play. Not recommended just because of this. We want to play the game exactly the way WE WANT TO PLAY THE GAME! Or we'll not play it at all. you Take Two!
0;"""What the actual where they thinking? """"Oh huh dur let us completely ruin modding for this game."""" Back when i did play this game I redone the storyline with mods and Enbs and the game was completely different far more enjoyable as well. Now i'm never ever coming back to this game and any further installment of Grand Theft Auto if this is going to be their stance."""
0;"""Why chaos letters so serious. I just bought the game just to play 9 hours you told me how I cheated. I seriously protest this behavior to stop this chaotic title phenomenon R stars noticed my comments people like your game you treat the player will sooner or later be players to """"title""""."""
0;DO NOT BUY! Rockstar bans everyone for no apparent reason when you try to get in touch with them they read off a script saying all bans are final and so on and do not care they just want your money and when they get it your buisness means nothing to them. I would never recommend such a game where developers do not care about there players.
0;As of June 16 2015 I would Strongly not recommend this game to anyone until Rockstar learns from their past mistakes and at least fix a simple problem of Memory leakage that existed back in GTA IV. Maybe one day a patch will come and fix this issue but until that day comes i don't recommend this game to anyone.
0;GTA 5 used to be one of my favourite games but now with the more recent updates i am quickly losing interest in the game because of rockstar/take two's stupid decisions like making everything super overpriced (forcing you in to buying shark cards) removing mods and making the payouts complete garbage (which makes farming very tedious)
0;Take Two have really shot themselves in the foot for their decision to send a cease and desist to OpenIV... ive never given a game a negative review until today.... we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;"""Had a review recommending GTA5 before but in face of recent events I will post a negative review. Modding is a healthy part of an ever growing community. Completely disabling it is even bigger non sense than Bethesda's move for """"paid mods"""". Get your together Take2.Sincerely probably everyone."""
0;Read the other negative reviews and see why they were banned. now guess why i was banned with 440 hours. so in short the games player base sucks the anti cheat system sucks the business model is scummy and its impossible to make money for the first hundred hours of gameplay do with that info as you will. right here is where i should say wait till rockstar fixes their but honestly dont even wait just never buy the game.
0;Single player It gud.Online It no gud. Overpriced items. Microtransactions. Mindnumbing grind system. Hackers and modders everywhere.Only buy if you want a good single player experience.If you want a good multiplayer experience DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's ing attrocious online.Optimization is gud too. Given the single player experience this game is really only worth like $30 $40 now. Having it still be $60 is disgusting.

0;Well when compared to Overkill Rockstar took a quite terrible way to deal with modding community.So these are what we got after they decided to take mods out from singleplayer.1.Hackers Hackers everywhere even they are banned as fast as possible.2.No MODs in singleplayer? Are you kidding me? 3.Sooooo god damned diifficult to earn your fortune in heists.Now GTAV became another game with open world but restricted gaming style.Rockstar good f*c*ing job.
0;O NOT BUY THIS GAME AS OF 2018 01 19 (Or more because they won't fix Just go download Fortnite Battle Royale it's freee to play and more fun and free of bugs.This game will not run smoothly no matter what kind of ing system you have.I don't know why they released it from early access while there's still so much things to fix.Please don't buyI know de waefollow de wae bruddahs.
0;Grand Theft Auto V is a great game. Don't get me wrong. But Take Two really shot themselves in the foot with taking down OpenIV. Mods are what makes this game fun. Especially since Rockstar obviously does not give a about adding proper single player content.
0;Support for OpenIV the largest modding platform by far has been shut down. Between that and and the microtransaction filled online and T2's attempts at sutting down any alternative to rockstar's online theres no real reason to pay anything close to full price for this game now.
0;The singleplayer is amazing the online is also amazing but beware they will ban you forever... that game that you just spent 60$ on yeah now you cant play it because rockstar deems you unworthy of playing their game you cant even buy it again you have to make an entirely new steam account because they wont let you unlink your steam and rockstar accounts.
0;"""Rather than funding useless lawsuits TakeTwo could have raised some funds for Rockstar to create a proper SDK Tool and distribute it along with a DLC.No they wanted to play the greedy capitalist """"Don't touch this this is my propriety"""" well if you are a potential buyer don't buy it fullprice find some shady key or some offshore seller."""
0;Don't buy this game. The developers are ing the community in the It's also plagued by hackers in which rockstar refuses to fix. Also there will NEVER be any singleplayer dlc even though it was promised to be released. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY BY BUYING THIS GAME.
0;Love the game play and the concept but cannot recommend the game due to the incessent &amp blatant hacking.. Even with Kill cam introduced in the 1.0 release these guys don't care and ruin the game for all the players. Until the developer starts to seriously look at the game communities concerns and addresses the issues around their loot reward concept i.e. selling clothing/ cratess for $$$ i am not sure you will see this game grow to anywhere near its potential.
0;3 words cease and desist Take 2 just ed everything that was good about the pc port. Yes there still is mods but the largest tool for modding Open IV just got ed for making the game fun.I bet most of the people writing the bad reviews came from someone like NerdCubed
0;The heist and other events in the game that involve lobbys a broken on PC It will automatically choose to go into freemode sometimes without considering you or your friends choice of what to do whether it be replay or shoose a different thing to play.
0;Well i only interested in the online and this game community is definitely terrible almost every session i go to there are hackers!!! It seem like cheater just cheat however they like and this ROCKSTAR publisher definitely isn't doing anything on it.https //i.imgur.com/lDPUPeY.jpgToday this stupid Chinese hacker wanjian1594 drop piles of vehicles onto me and screw up my sales
0;Although I am not one of the unfortunate players that have been wrongly banned from this game. I do not recommend buying this game UNTIL FailStar (Rock Star) sort thier out. I have a Friend who got thier account temp banned. He then uninstalled and re installed a fresh copy once his ban was lifted. 2hrs into his fresh install he is now Perm banned. Good on you FailStar Nice way of treating your playerbase!!!!!
0;"""grand theft auto is no longer a good game rasing prices for online in game dlc required items and cars to well over the games original worth is rediculus now their going after single player modding tool program developers to force people to play online and spend money on """"micro transactions"""" is for the slum lord's and scum bag's."""
0;I thought the game was mediocre when it first released. Now that Take Two made OpenIV cease and desist I have come to hate it.**NOTE**My lack of hours from the game is from when I refunded it because my PC was a potato back then. I had experience with the game on consoles but haven't played it since PC since my disc got laser burnt.
0;pros pretty sick game fun with friends gorgeous graphics endless possibilities great features killing randoms until they rq the lobby is satisfyingcons loading times are pretty bad you actually have to have no life to grind in order to make money stuck in cloud city a lot lester is extremely irritating moddersuntil you get banned for 30 days without knowing the reason why.will uninstall and probably never touch the game again.i love R* !
0;"""The CEO of a company who personally """"stays as far away as possible"""" from video games decides that the fourth best selling video game of all time isn't making him and his business nearly enough money. Rather than creating more video games they over one of the most loyal and dedicated parts of their game's fanbase. ing smart. you Strauss Zelnick and Take Two.... Greedy ing parasites."""
0;It's just great how the anti cheat system will ban someone and not tell them why. Then you call up Rockstar and they will also not tell you why you got banned or look into it at all. This happened to a friend of mine and he got banned for a month and will get all his stats reset after that time (Not that he is going to play again after this). I can not recommand this game now at all due to the bad customer server and very bad anti cheat system.
0;One of the longest and proudest traditions in all of GTA history is the modding community. TakeTwo just murdered it in cold blood. I'll be damned if they ever see another dime from me or anyone I have any influence over in this life. In the tradition of GTA games everywhere Go yourself TakeTwo!
0;I really want to like the game but Rockstar is making it difficult. Many people (including me once) has been banned for no reason on the online version and the singleplayer never gets updated. It seems they are making so much money from GTA Online that they have completely forgot they have an offline version as well which is sad for us who loves (and perhaps prefers) singleplayer games.
0;DO NOT EVER BUY THIS! If you buy it all you are doing is forcing gaming down the of microtransactions. Take Two killed the modding community just because they wanted people to pay for more microtransactions. By buying this game or anything in it you are telling them that this behavior is fine. We have to stand up against these money hungry If you spend any money on this game or any Take Two game you are causing the collapse of the gaming industry.
0;I refused to buy this trash game when Rockstar wouldn't let me transfer all my hard work and millions in my 360 account to the Xbox One. I'm not spending 100s of hours again or giving this mass murder simulator supporting company any money for Shark Cards.
0;My account that is clean got banned without any justification by rockstar. The ban is allegedly caused by the new anti cheat they made. I lost all my progress due to their mistake how is this fair? well they will not play fair. so might as well start the backlash bois. Lets just wait if they will fix this and give the compensation we all deserve
0;"""They rarely listen to what the people playing ask for more bugs than features plus """"well those bugs that made you lose your $1 670 000 car is still in there but now there are MORE CARS!"""" I like the updates but they need to focus on what's really important a playable online game"""
0;"""Take Two deciding to stop OpenIV coupled with the fact that the game refuses to start because """"it can't connect to the internet"""" no matter what I try gets a negative review from me I used to like this game and company sad how they ruined their hard earned reputation in a few months"""
0;Totally game is OK. But bugs in this game are just insane. Don t buy it unless you is a guy who like to make pain yourself.Developers don t listen to players. The only thing which matters them is SharkCards. Multiplayer is filled with hackers. They are in game for hmmm... I suppose few years and Rockstar is doing nothing to stop they. Instead they are just **** players in their asses as hard as possible. You buying a game but getting a piece of And Loading Screen will be your best friend.
0;As much as I enjoy this and all of the other GTA games if you actively try to supress the community for your game you do not deserve support. This change of support for modding by Take Two is fueled entirely by a desire to monetize the multiplayer and force more people from the singleplayer to the multiplayer.
0;The game is phenomenal on it's own yes but as of Mid 2017 due to legal issues Rockstar and their parent company Take Two Interactive decided to shut down PC mods entirely. Again truely the game is great one way or the other but this anti consumer mindset cannot go unpunished.
0;rs is so that they can fix their own game i have 600+ hours online and every update i hope it maybe gets better but no it will never get better i wich i cud get a revund or somting big wast of money and life dont buy this crap for onlinenever modded 800+ hours of grinding and work to get all the i have + got alot of shark cards so that i woot not get banned becose of the modded money wtf is this instead of banning the honest playes bann the damm modders ing idiots..
0;Cease and Desist to OpenIV staff. I paid for a product that I soon will not be using anymore. I refuse to give any more money to such a greedy company.Microtransactions are awful.The new DLC is just pitiful at this point.The game was fun when I could do what I wanted with it. GTA5 is dead.
0;This Review is only for GTA OnlineLong loading screens even with a SSD and a unstable Netcode dampen the experience severly. More than once me and my friends got disconnected from the server or couldn't see each other ingame or the game turned into a slideshow for the guy on passenger seat. This was especially annoying during heists and ruined most of our fun. Rockstar had to two years to fix this issue.
0;The reason I bought GTA was modding. Not cheating but I love to play LCPDFR mode with new cars kr uniforms etc. Banning our favorite tool made me angry and I don't suppkrt this game anymore. They have taken the fun out of this game so niw it is usuless. Don't recommend anyone to buy this game anymore.
0;I used to love this game but now i don't. i won't even recommend it to my friends. so much disappointment from the publishers greed of money. don't buy this on sale. won't be changing reviews until got an official statements from OpenIV and R* regarding the issue
0;Don't purchase. Rockstar has been banning a lot of innocent accounts for no reason at all including accounts that have only existed for just a few hours. They've shown no motivation to actually correct this problem because they get enough money from console players. My friend has never modded and lost his whole account progress over this glitch. Avoid at all costs.
0;Full of bugs even after few years running. It is fun but still I wont recomment this game. Singleplayer is kinda boring some missions are okay. Muliplayer is a complete disaster. Loading screen takes too much so i can call this game a loading screen simulator xD Anyways dissapointed in the game rockstar not realy doing anything. Money was a waste.
0;Game is plagued by players with a kill on site attitude. Half the weapons and vehicles in the game shouldnt exist. Money is extremly hard to come by if your not doing gamemodes. Servers are messing up 99.99999% of the time. You will wait more in loading screens than actually playing the game. Gamemodes are more buggy than any other game i have ever seen. Rockstar support is terrible. Only get this game if you have the highest amount of patience.
0;After 3466 hours of enjoyable gameplay and hitting level 550.My account got hacked and banned then reset. Thanks tar no appealing process just straight up ban. After 3 4 years and numerous copies on a few different platforms same character why would I need to hack? Up yours rock star. Shove red dead 2 up your
0;Really wish the developers would put their efforts into fixing bugs UI problems and getting rid of the absurd amount of blatant hackers that have plagued this game for ages instead of patching money glitches in mere hours to make sure you have to grind your balls off or spend a ton of money to get the good stuff and then refusing to even think about the other issues in desperate need of attention.
0;They completely ed why i bought this game by sending a decease and desist letter to the makers of the OpenIV mod.This mod is the backbone of GTA modding and has been for years without it tons of mods will stop working entirely.Modding is why i bought GTA and its the reason i came back time and again to about but by doing this they're ing over a community of people that mod and especially the modders who put their free time into making mods that without OpenIV WON'T WORK.
0;Over 1000 hours and now I just don't want to play anymore. At this point if you dont have the game dont bother since the best of the community left long ago. This sandbox is still fairly amazing as long as you have the money (which you wont) but without the real community there the worlds just dead even at its best.
0;I have to say that this one is one of the worst game I ever buy the online take a LOT of time to join (and the lag is crazy) 1/4 of matchs have at least one hacker...Btw the single player is good enough to buy this game con sale (BUT I DONT RECOMEND THIS buy another game instead)
0;I don't play this game anymore but Mods were the reason I put more than 100 hours in single player alone. So Take Two's decision to ban OpenIV makes this game loses its unique and fun experience on PC. And more importantly Take Two took every consumer's right to do whatever they want with a product they paid 60$ for. So for these reasons I don't recommend this game unless Take Two backs off their actions
0;This is not the game people would buy from rockstar games.People have been modding games on the pc since they were created and this game is the first one to ban modding even on single player. They really took it too far and I don't recommend you to buy any games published by Rockstar Games
0;The cease and desist letter by Take Two Interactive to Open IV should become a textbook example of how NOT to treat your target market.This also creates a very worrying precedent Future incarnations of the GTA series might not have mod compatibility (thus robbing the relatively unlimited potential of the GTA franchise we have all come to love).If you happen upon this review just do me (and yourself) a favour Remember to check if future GTA games have modding capabilities before purchasing.
0;Before I start just let me say that the single player like everyone else says is amazing and fun. However the online aspect has the appeal of a naked run through a field of cactus so unless you love to cheat or just like making peoples lives hard stay very far away from GTA Online.
0;as much as I kind of hate to do this I'm voting down the game in protest of Take Two Interactive's more or less BANNING of modding the main reason many buy a PC port of a game as did I originally so F**K YOU Take Two! R* have even SHOWCASED mods on their Blog saying that they completely support modding so F**K YOU TAKE TWO!
0;I'd like to ask you for a full refund! U do NOTHING with modders and macros users. Now then can disconnect players from session. In every session there's atleast 2 modders. There's no interest to play vs modders and macros users no challenge coz u'll loose anyway.
0;There needs to be more support for the modding community and the recent actions of Take Two are unacceptable. The greed of Rockstar and Take Two and their approach when it comes to buying Shark Cards is poisoning gaming. Don't support this type of practice stay away from this game.
0;Once a shining new standard for games in 2013 now a stagnant shell with nothing but trivial online content added behind the usual grind or pay system. Removal of mod support has made this just another 5 year old game that has already made record profits asking for more money.
0;you Rockstar. I pre ordered this garbage A YEAR before it came out. I was expecting a San Andreas 2 but all I got was a lot of nickle and diminig castrated modding and a giant world with nothing to do. I ing hate the direction you're taking the series. I know you won't ever listen since every game is a guaranteed success and you have no reason to change anything but destroying the last bit of modding left in this game is inexcusable. I hate GTA O and I hate you Rockstar.
0;As much as I loved this game I simply cannot recommend. The story is great but boring once 100%. GTA Online is really trash and the only means of getting money legitimately is to grind (which you only get one car out of) or to buy shark cards (their way of getting money even though this game is selling like crazy across the PC and Console platforms). Modding is the only way of fun. You're better off watching videos on GTAO instead of playing this game.
0;I loved Grand Theft Auto 5 it was amazing with the endless amount of mods for single player like LSPDFR. But know since mods are banned It really sucks paying all of this money when you are going to get bord of this game. I also dislike that they took away the moding tools so they can make more money off the game. Im done with this game now and im done with rockstar! GTA online Sucks people are jurks on there and you cant do anything. #BRINGMODSBACK #ROCKSTARSUCKS
0;I modded GTA Online and am currently level 1069 and have over a trillion dollars. I have yet to be banned. Yet a bunch of entirely legitimate players people who actually spent money on shark cards and worked their asses off get banned? The is going on here Rockstar?
0;Go play the Solo game for the multiplayer stick to the mission and the heists the freemode is not worth it at allLeaving a negative review because of the horrible state of the multiplayer which is a huge part of why the game still exist and isn't simply dead and how Rockstar did nothing about the massive amount of unfairly banned players and the astonishing amount of cheaters on the game also the community of this multiplayer is one of the most toxic I have seen of all my years of gaming
0;Buy knowing that only half of the game is actually trully playable and that would be the single player. Online is a joke. Modders in every lobby doing what they please w/o reprecussion an anti cheat system that bans legit players instead of modders/hackers and such poor staff that they've ignored most of what players have been saying for years now. Story is awesome online has been trash for a while...
0;I didn't use a plug in. I didn't interfere with other players playing games. There was no reason to be a title. You did not have human rights. ! ! ! On March 23th I logged into the game normally and completed the game task without any external actions nor any action that interfered with the player. Everything in my game is normal behavior. Untitled was sealed until April 23 2018 Please solve the cover
0;If you get this game only the story mode is worth bothering with. GTA online is complete and should be avoided like the plague false bans are rampant and Rockstar point blank refuse to take any responsibility for the mess. All told definitely NOT worth the price.
0;Can't recommend.It's a ing premium game AAA price yet the cash hungry jackals pf Take2 milk the multiplayer more than some free2play games do.Take2 is a prime example of unlimited greed ruining the gaming industry so I can't recommend supporting this.
0;GTA V is a fun game but it is also one of the most annoying games to start up and play for longer than 10 min. The reason why is because it either crashes or loads for 15 minutes everytime i finish a heist join a new loby or try to play any mini games. In all GTA V is one of the worst games i have ever played and really wish that you spent any of your million dollars to help the game at all.
0;"""let people who wants free $$$ have free cash if they dont like what the modder is doing (giving them money without consent or teleporting them and killing them) then report themn BUT FOR GOD SAKES LET THE PEOPLE WHO WANT THE MODS HAVE THE MODS WHO CARES IF THEY HAS 999 999 999 999 ING DOLLARS IF THAT PERSON IS PICKING ON A NOOB THERE IS A ING """"FIND NEW SESSION"""" BUTTON FOR A REASON!"""
0;"""Surprised I played 120 Hours on the game.Its fun for like 20 minutes lol. Too much importance on money than the actual purpose""""Grand theft auto"""" stealing cars not buying them. Damage on cars is unrealistic. Psychic's on cars and fighting is terrible. The only thing I enjoy is uh.. Well.. Um. The uh.. The guns..."""
0;Havent played anything but races the last 5 months. Logs on after two weeks of inactivity and my user is banned. WTF Rockstar? These random bans need to stop. Only thing the game tells you when you are banned is that you are banned no reason no date of bann. I would recommend this game to everyone if it hadnt been for the random banning. I have 380 hours wasted now.
0;Got a 30 day suspension for no reason no mods no exploites nothing just a random suspension and character reset rockstar I can't even appeal it and they closed my support ticket half an hour after I submitted it they ignore their players and ban people at random while I see modders run around unchecked dropping cash on players and then those players get banned instead of the modders don't buy this
0;Just no... They make it look fun your mind will change when you see the ton of microtransactions. This is pay to win or grind through hell to have decent things. Bans are dishing out left and right for no reason... Absolute trash game. Don't fall for this like I did. This is just eye candy. It looks good but it doesn't taste good.
0;I will never pay for any game Rockstar puts out Reasons 1 worst support service ever (Note I have not been banned)2 cheaters on every server3 Rockstar is so very very VERY greedy!!!!!!!4 Rockstar does not care about their customers in ANY waySingle player was fun but never again will rockstar get a cent from me
0;the game itself is awesome.. but modders completely ruin it online constantly.. lucky to get an ho0ur of game play in before a modder comes a long and screws up everything.. now they can even get everyone banned from their own organizations all at once.. so stupid. if you are one of these modders.. please die.
0;Don't support these schlubs.PUBG has filed a law suit against Epic Games on false copyright protection grounds. Pubg Bluehole Brendan Greene you can all go rot in hell. Your values as a company are compareable to Konami and I can't wait to see you lose this battle.
0;Terrible maintained game ya dingus crashes frequently constant issue with very long login time for GTA online so y ou sit there like a turkey offline mode is great. Need to fix these bugs for such a long standing game. I'm Dr. Steve Brule For your health.
0;"""I hadn't played for a while and got on. It worked great for a while and i logged off for a time and afetr logging back on it game me a message saying that i was banned for a month and was having my Online character errased. As i have done more research it seems that the new update might have cause the issue which doesn't making anthing better. In short Rockstar make a big """"OOF""""."""
0;Bastradss the anti cheat is tt Got banned back in 2017 and tried fighting the ban and called and everyone there is just a bunch of fat with no life No pun intended. It is GRAND THEFT you damn bunghole! I just want my 30 dollars back to go eat more Mcdanks bro. GTA bro shiit is boring as anyway. My hours are my idle count because I got BORED and did not care Have a nice day you no life smelly wet hairy toenail eating figure.
0;This game pisses me off. UPDATE still pisses me off it needs alot of work to be a good game. Constant lags and gltches even in it's baby stage. updates take forever to come around. slolwly getting tired of this game and the constant struggles it brings to the point where it no longer becomes enjoyable to play.
0;Rockstar you started out so well so pure and caring but now? Why does no one drive normal cars in this car anymore?Furthermore your flying bikes they are ruining the game so badly if you use an Oppressor you suck everyone hates you and it makes you look like you can't play the game properaly.Rockstar clearly just used GTA online in the end as a cash cow and stopped caring about the players a long time ago save for RDR2
0;The game itself is fun however Take Two has ruined the online portion AND the single player by ruining the modding community and forcing people to either buy shark cards or get banned because another cheater joins your server and gets you nuked in the process forcing you to buy the game again. Stick to friend only games have fun spending an eternity grinding for money and watch your back 24/7 in public lobbies. 7/10 gameplay because bugs and terrible grinding process 2/10 customer service.
0;What are you guys playing? I m supposed to play Grand Theft Auto V but this one company keeps stealing my money.Is it Take Two?!Yeah Take Two.Who is Take Two?Some say Take Two is the first greedy company ever.Born from hell.I heard Take Two can take a wheelbarrow full of money from players.I heard Take Two once shutdown a modding group with a single blow.But the worst part is just when you think you re safe just when you think you might escape WHAM!!! You lose money getting banned or sued!!!
0;"""Game itself is fun but you won't be doing much of that as most of the time you spend loading and hoping the game doesn't crash. My game crashes very often and even more commons are the errors while loading. Rockstar's solution to these errors are """"Wait for 4 hours and try again"""" Doesn't sound too good right? Rather spend your money on some other junk!"""
0;I do not recommend this game. I was banned for 30 days and called them and they wouldn't tell me why I was banned. I get unbanned and then after 1 day get permanently banned. I call them again and THEN THEY TELL ME I GOT BANNED FOR MODDING?!?!?! I know you probably don't believe this but I never modded on my life. Rockstar Games is literally banning honest players and ruining the experience for them. I hope they change someone in GTA 6 or looks like online will stay bad. Rip.
0;The game is amazingly fun and challenging. It is one of the best (if not the BEST) Battle Royale game out there.But this game has a virus. And this virus comes in the form of Cheaters/Hackers. Since the 1.0 Update there seems to be a massive amount of Hackers. It is slowly killing this game. And the problem with cheaters mostly comes from Chinese players and from BattleEye just being unable (or taking to long) in banning players.So right now i can't recommend the game as it is.
0;Product received for free. GTA OnlineGreedy producers overpriced content hackers everywhere toxic community horrible AI endless loading screens buggy far too weaponized misleading title and tryhards everywhere. Want to drive around with a sportscar in a public session? Forget it you'll be locked onto by a flying car for and giggles. If they could simply add the Online content to storymode that would be awesome.
0;This game was great when first released but has since been overrun with modding cheater holes. It it literally impossible to join a server with more than 4 people and not have someone who is cheating. I don't know if Rockstar doesn't care or is just too incompetent to ban any of the hundreds of people I have reported but they are making absolutely no apparent progress in cleaning the online community.
0;This game is nothing but trouble. Online play is filled with nothing but jerks and hackers. Hackers have the ability to remove weapons spawn items on top of you kick you from sessions and block you from being a CEO to make money. Until rockstar bans all hackers and modders and changes from a peer to peer system to a dedicated server system I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you're prepared for game or even PC crashes due to no good a**holes.
0;2018 Edit The Single Player is excellent. Don't buy this game for online though. It's really bad and a cash grab. Also 60 Euros for a 3 year old game (5 years if you count original release) is a joke. Buy on sale People buy your game to play modsYou shut down modsYou are pretty stupid
0;Multiplayer is absolutely ing ruined in game economy is trash and broken over militarised hackers everywhere basically saint's row but 10 times worse and more toxic. Only good part of this game is the singleplayer.+ Update two days later after critisicing the game for the first time and would you know I got perma banned online despite being clean no reason given at all and their toxic support system doesn't allow appeals. R*.
0;When you play almost 600 hours log back in after almost a year and get banned.No response from rockstar on support tickets or twitter nice.Especially nice when you get another copy on sale and that one gets banned as well. Good Job rockstar ban the people that actually want to play your game. That's a great idea.
0;Logged in for the first time in months yesterday. Went to play again today only to find that I'd been banned despite only travelling to my Bunker to check supplies yesterday. Not even a reason why.I had a lot of fun playing this with friends but won't be buying any RockStar games in the future. The developers don't deserve to be supported even for single player.
0;The game has an anti modding policy and kills community projects. The anti cheat is horrible almost non existing.The online mode is p2p based with long loading times.To be honest the game is really fun to play but not with the pay2win/insanely grindy (like playing 20 hours to get a vehicle grindy) aspect. Maybe a cheater gave me a bunch of money which made the game enjoyable for me or maybe I just made that up.
0;Rename this game Loading Simulator. The connectivity issues &amp bugs has gotten way out of hand. Frankly it looks like they've given up all hope on stable servers and reliable gameplay. Too many hackers and way to little effort to deal with them. Pay2Win Extreme EditionWould not recommend this game if you like to actually do anything other than constantly disconnect never get to join in the first place or just get bugged to oblivion...
0;GTA V is nothing more than a glorified MP game. The SP experince has been neutered in favor of the MP micro transaction business model. The SP part is extremely short and not as well thought out as San Andreas. Yes the world is huge but there are far less things you can interact with in SP vs MP. If you're looking for a fantastic SP GTA experience go back to San Andreas. Saying that this game blows is an understatement. Looks like Rockstar has turned into a bunch of posers.
0;This review is only about GTA V ONLINE.So I started out having a lot of fun but it started to feel like I have to do a lot of grinding and I REALLY hate grinding in games. And at a point it felt like I had to pay to win. What makes it even harder is that when you do grind you have to deal with people who have the crazy new car with guns mounted on it or something! I thought the game was suppose to be realistic but at this point it's just pay to win.
0;The sole reason why I bought this game on PC was for the Single Player Mods.Now that Take 2 is killing it I have no reason to play on PC.If I ever want to play this game again it might be on my PS4 and in that case I'll just rent it or perhaps borrow it from a friend.
0;I will not buy another Rockstar game until they can demonstrate they know how to support a game and deliver on their advertising promises. The multiplayer is broken and unplayable the mandatory social club is annoying the false sale is insulting and the rules on mods are unreasonable and restrictive.DONT spend $60 on this $20 game.
0;Without even getting into the whole mod ordeal.I have spent more time messing with settings than actual gameplay trying different combos delusionally hoping that I would find a particular setup that allows gameplay that doesn't hiccup.What a waste.i7 4790 Asus 980 strix16GB RamGame installed on crucial ssd
0;I like this game i like the beautiful graphic and good story but this game is filled up with hackers. I dont like the online Matchmaking for example in stealth missions or races. The matchmaking will give you too good mates in races and too bad people in stealth missions.
0;From getting mods finaly after years on a Fallout 4 and also starting in Skyrim and adding mods to that. It litterally made my games feel 10x better. What Take 2 has dictated as you cant mod your game its end user as you cant modd your game. That you even if off line cant even have mods in this era of gaming is like a step back. Simply 10yrs of OK then flip it is sad. Fix your online hackers before hatting on modders. So sorry dont help them rack in them dumster turcks of money
0;Solid single player experience but once its over its pretty boring. The online is extremely grindy and repetitive to the point of getting no where when trying to earn items/cash. Pretty much forced to use micro transactions.R* Promised single player DLC and never delivered. Pretty disappointing experience from one of my favorite companies.
0;Product received for free. Honestly I'm having a ton of fun with this game but I don't really think I would recommend it. It requires a TON of grinding and there are hackers everywhere that Rockstar will not do anything about. I would be fine with the grinding if hackers weren't in every other lobby blowing everyone up constantly.
0;Take Two I really hope you're going to do something to ease the raging inferno that's going on throughout the GTA modding community.I love the game but I currently can't recommend it until some form of solution can be made so that modders can still freely mod the single player portion as they wish while allowing the multiplayer portion to run with fewer risks of running into cheaters.
0;used to be one of the greatest online experiences I ever had turned into a hackfest with absolute brainless grind to get anything past vanilla content.story mode/offline play still a masterpiece thoughedit since take two and rockstar decided to ban players and prohibit ANY MOD in the OFFLINE play this game turned into utter
0;Used to be a great game. Ruined by Rockstar's money hungry tendencies for micro transactions and making in game purchases so expensive and mission rewards so low that its near impossible to grind enough to afford anything. Sad how far its gone downhill.
0;&gt one day before steam sale&gt R* raises price of GTA V from 60 to 80 dollars&gt put it on sale 25% off so it is back down to 60 and appears like a good deal&gt thinks customers are big enough idiots to fall for it&gt lol&gt 11/10 would get ed over by you mofos again&gt gg R*
0;As a Gta 5 Youtuber That needs mods to make them I am hating those Two Whatever e r s For taking away Open IV from us. Not to mention that Online is insanely now because all there is are piles and piles of new cars and wierd missions and features being added that require a butt load of in game money to buy and opererate and the only way to truly get the money in game is to grind for so many hours or just buy shark cards (Which Rockstar wants xD)Single Player GoodOnline Badlol k
0;Good game but can't recommend due to Rockstar's shady practices...Banning people who paid 60 freakin dollars because they use mods to enhance their SP experience is abhorrent and violates the basic principles of PC gaming. It's made even more ridiculous by the fact that most of these mods are harmless graphical fixes (such as the FOV mod) which serve to improve the already awesome game that rockstar has developed.I hope the developers change their stance about this and do it soon.
0;its a good game with all the pc crashes glitches black screens freezes making my desktop icons vanish bsod screen flickering low memory when it isnt memory leaks and also been reading about ppl being banned for no reason too all i can say is save ur money and wait till there r fixes for it for this version go buy the witcher III or something i think i made a mistake lol its a good game it just would be even better if all that crap wasnt messing up.
0;A fantastic game though with multiplayer ruined by rampant hackers/modders/cheaters/script kids. I'm only in it for the multiplayer so to me the game is no longer fit for purpose and cannot recommend it at this moment in time. I just hope R* can implement some anti cheat measures before they alienate the legitimate players.
0;Nice job ruining the only reason I played your newest game. I missed GTA IV's style of online and you completely dissapointed me with this new version of online. Despite that fact I loved the story and and offline modding. We'll now all I've got is story mode with no mods so I may end up completely deleting this game now that I can't really experience anything new without paying s of money to play the garbage pay2win online mode.
0;It is impossible to say anything good about this game after what Take Two has done to the modding scene of this game. The game shows what happens when a company is only interested about squeezing every penny they can get out of a game. They're trying to draw people to GTA Online (which over the last 18 months has been completely ruined by microtransactions) by banning modding on the singleplayer. This is unbelieveably scummy and Take Two must be told that this is unacceptable.
0;152 hours of game play never cheated never hacked. Played on invite only maps with one other person and some how I got banned. Sent multiple emails and always got automated responses within 30 seconds of sending. I will never buy another Rockstar game nor will I ever recommned it in fact I will tell everyone to buy another game where the Devs actaully take time to respond to their paying customers.
0;"""Takes over an hour to get three people into the same session only to have """"Hacker"""" / """"Modder"""" freeze all players in the session or to repeatedly blow you up whilst you're in a safe zone (apartment) or to spawn scenery and vehicles around you to lag out your game.Shame single player was actually really good."""
0;Bring back singleplayer mods you moneygrubbing hacks!If you don't know what i'm talking about Rockstar's parent company is issuing cease and desist letters to creators of singleplayer mods in an effort to force people to play online so they can boost thier profit through microtransactions. This is removing mods that allow updated content that is only normally acessible in online play to be acessed in singleplayer such as new weapons and vehicles. It's t and it needs to stop now
0;"""Stay as far away from this game as possible.It used to be fun but now every single lobby is filled with exploiters. Literally the chances of you joining a lobby without an exploiter is very rare. It has completely ruined the quality of the game.Aside from that if you want any cool vehicles or have any fun at all you need to pay real money for """"shark cards."""" It's a ridiculous business model."""
0;Pros Singleplayer is good the game looks good and it's fun to play with only your well civilized non douchey friends. Cons every player you will ever meet in online is a Rockstar has a lack of caring about the community the game has become honey bunches of hackers and you have to do a bunch of BS for the smallest amount of money.
0;Actively shutting down 100% legal singleplayer modding tools after refusing to develop pretty much anything for singleplayer post launch should not be encouraged.EDIT Open IV had a successful petition and were able to keep the program running so beside's my before stated point. The game is fantastic and I recommend it for anyone with a need to blow up.
0;The overall constant push to buy shark cards has ruined this game. It is impossible to get any substantial amount of money without buying said shark cards. All new content requires players to be in a Public Online Session which makes it almost impossible to even play as other plays focus on killing you while you're racing to finish in time. Biker gang and SecuroSrv give no reason for other players to help you as they get pennies while you get quarters...
0;"""Rockstar you dissapoint me. Screw. You.If you don't fix this greedy """"sale"""" t you can say goodbye to me as a customer.Don't your customers over with this kind of or you'll be nothing but another EA and/or Activision.Do not support these people until they learn that we will NOT accept this type of greedy business practice."""
0;"""I wanted to like this game really I did I tried giving it second chances multiple times playing it with friends online but at this point it's too late GTA V dug it's own grave what with the playerbase being flat out cancerous with hackers trolls or just that """"one guy in a jet or whatever"""" on top of all the problems Rockstar flat out just doesn't really help you out when you need it. If all of this ever changes I'd gladly play in a heartbeat but honestly and sadly I think it never will"""
0;After over a year of playing this game it still takes forever to load and feels sluggish and unomptimized. Im tired of mediocre content constantly being added to seemingly distract the players from the fact that the game is still pretty much in pre alpha gameplay wise. Not just PUBG is guilty of this and it is frustrating. Still the game could be so good if they just spent some time making it feel snappy and optimized.
0;While Take Two continues their jewish world domination effort not realizing that literally everyone with a brain is against them. Much as I wouldn't like Rockstar to be hurt by Take Two's greed arrogance and general stupidity they just gotta tell Take Two to themselves.
0;Not recomended at all. Lot of bugs on maps you will be stuck on map or kicked out of the car for no reason ...Hitmodel totally screwed your arm works like vest level4 ....Close combat is totaly random due ping lag and strange guns beahavior.Every update brings new bugs .After one year is still in beta. They call it version 1 it is just for earn more money make more sad players on another platform etc.DON'T LET THEM STEAL YOUR MONEY.
0;one word PAYWALLto play the game fully you can do three things.1.Grind forever to buy everything2.Hand your wallet to Rockstar to buy everything3.Pay 10 quid to get 500m in your accountI used to play this game on PS3 and PS4 it was great but after the OG hiests update everything got way too expensive and the game has lost any fun it did have.Ta Rockstar for being greedy
0;Im baned for enternity now i did mod but i had no idea of bans and i did stop after 2 and someone else gave me money still banned me if u dont want modders make a way to disable mods online use steam mod store or something dont be a game and i only did it cause unless you want to pay hundreds of dollars or spend every waking minute on this game you have to to get money but now that theyve been and taken away mods why cant everyone get unbanned
0;I can t ing believe that you destroy the hard work of tens of thousands of modders that tried to make the game better that you destroy the years of work of whole modding teams destroying a huge community because you assumed that OpenIV is responsible for the cheats? I have never experience something so unfair so stupid and so unbelievably ing pointless and dumb in my whole life I literally can t express how ing mad I am.
0;"""Just got banned for nothing while doing a heist with my friend. My account is suspended for 30 days and my character is deleted with all the years of progress with it gone. I was going to submit a ticket but Rockstar rather close their ears and yell """"LALALALALALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU"""" then help."""
0;I'm done buying your games Take Two. Getting rid of OpenIV was the BIGGEST MISTAKE you could ever have made! I only got GTA V so I could play with mods offline. Now it's pointless to have it in my library because it was the only thing keeping me playing. F*** you!
0;The online part has seriously gone down hill over the years.Takes longer to buy s**t and there are still several issues that have not been addressed.If you don't already own the game crack the game for the single player and tell the online part to go F*** it self.
0;GTA online is absolutely atrocious it adds hours of aggresively mediocre new content that are only available through glitching cheating or as many have complained hundreds of hours of grinding to gain access to. Playing online is truly the most frustrating boring and unpleasant experience. Don't play it and much less spend any amount of money on it or otherwise rockstar will never move on to new and better things.
0;Rockstar only want you to have fun on their terms so long as you pay for it in microtransactions...Even with cheats you'll only have fun for a while until you run out of stupid things to do with them.Here's an idea rockstar... Actually put thought into your Online overworld design and make it you know... FUN? Then maybe cheat's wouldn't be so rampant
0;Don't buy this. Spent hours and hours on this game got rolled back twice. Got my money taken away that was earned trought grinding heists. Every online lobby has a modder in it if you can even get past the 12 minute loading screen even on great rigs. Terrible matchmaking nowadays mostly played by younger folk that beg in lobbies for cash.Long story short great single player but it's not worth the money. You'll just risk being banned for just being on GTA Multiplayer.
0;"""Drip feeding content when there is content they add things that are over saturated like super cars bad servers that take 20 minutes to load and the WORST thing about playing online are the scriptkiddies that use mods to godmode and forcibly crash your game.The single player is good but all of the sudden it seems like Rockstar forgot about it no updates and no """"single player DLC"""" like they promised."""
0;"""Absolutely trash game to join if you're joining late. I don't like using """"mods"""" or """"glitches"""" or any work arounds to get ahead. So if you're trying to advance...good luck. If you're not getting continuously assaulted by more seasoned players with nothing better to do whatever businesses you buy will get raided and you'll most likely die and have to start from the ground up constantly. This game milks you of shark cards. I'm so done."""
0;Excellent Gameplay but an awful community. I can not reccomend the game because of how awful the community is. Players constantly leave heists and are toxic bored high level players will make your life a nightmare and many more terrible things. If you have friends this game it is very fun if not... stick to singleplayer
0;do not buy this game! even if you think it's a great game do not buy it. the community is all the players use codes to kill you it takes a lot of time to get in the game and often gets stuck. it's worth buying only if you have 4 friends to play with! please keep your money or buy another game that deserves
0;Grand Theft auto Series use to be my greatest joy and pastime sadly these days i just get angry every time i try to play between the non stop drops when playing with friends because their servers suck and the rediculous forcement of having to buy their shark cards to ever get anything in this game its Trash and i dont ever recommend it. If i wanted a pay to play game id just go back to Archeage and suffer that.
0;Games are good games. But it is always wrong to prohibit the player's account. The player who gave money didn't get the game he wanted to play. 17 times the wrong seal. It was banned once in March 23rd this year. The online account in my game is permanently blocked. Is my account two times wrong? Very interesting Let green players quit the game right? Is the plug in player online? Rock stars are really good and good. I won't buy gta6. After all the rock star company's product.
0;"""Almost 600 hours of playing mainly GTA Online and I gotta tell ya the fact that Take Two decided to outright ban modding in any way shape or form...that's not leaving a very good taste in my mouth. I'm talking about single player mods being totally banned online modding is rampant and totally destructive.I've always supported Rockstar but this was the final nail in the coffin. Sometimes pressing the """"Self Destruct"""" button isn't always the best way to solve your problems..."""
0;Rockstar removed ALL my legit 30 million when a modder drops 50k money on my head and now i have 100k left making the game unenjoyable since everything is so overpriced with all those Dlcs a $100 Shark card could only get u a few things in game and not enough for one GOLDEN plane which cost 10mil.Maybe making things less overpriced might reduce the amount of people taking false money ingame.GTA Online use to be good...
0;Welp this game has only best campaign but very Online. and by online is I mean it's all the cars planes boats u want to buy is all in overpriced cause it takes you goddamn weeks to get one at least. Campaign is only the great part of the game then Rockstar got so greedy they added Shark card etc. and who is gonna buy this honestly. Some of the players will hack tbh because how greedy developers are.
0;Im sad that this game with so many dedicated players got shafted by Take 2 after so mush dedication went into the entire community to expand the game in the single player perspective hopefully they can take down cheaters aswell in the multiplayer environment with this sudden change of heart. otherwise its just like they took a big fat dump on the community and flipped them off.
0;So they ed with the #1 utility to make mods. They said it was because of hackers abusing this modding tool in GTA Online. Barring the fact that OpenIV didn't affect multiplayer... Where do they get off pretending they ever cared about hackers in Online???Ok game bad unregulated and unbalanced online mode and modding is now essentially illegal. God help anyone who got this game on PC just so they could mod it.
0;Steam started out as a great platform for this game but the hacking is rampant. It has gotten to the point where you can enter an online session and have your game data hacked so that every time you join a new session you blow up or have 100 body doubles on top of your own. It's just not an enjoyable game when there are constantly people flying around in jets the size of the largest skyscraper. It's just not a good game anymore. 3/10
0;"500+ hours since the beta here's how it goes PUBG lauched incredibly well it was new it was early access and made a sh*t ton of money. We all thinked that with the money Bluehole would hire people to fix and optimize the game. Instead they brought loot boxes/microtransactions. Now they started something called ""Fix PUBG"" based on their reports in there we get 4 more fps since it started ""4"". They're greedy and useless."
0;They raised the price so it would look like there was a discount during the summer sale. Hackers run rampant in online mode. I got a 1 week cooldown for glitching money into the game whereas the people who actually hack do not get any penalty (Soure My friend hacks on GTA Online every day and nothing is done to his account)
0;step 1. Becomes a money bringing out shark cards step 2. do patches that break the money system that forces you to spend your life on the game or buy money with IRL cashstep 3. get kids to get you millionsstep 4. get greedy step 5. ban modsstep 6. ruin your own game gg nice one lads
0;Used to be an OKAY game but now it's complete trash. Modders running amok in every single lobby you get disconnected from sessions left and right. Can't even finish a simple MC mission without myself or one of my friends being dropped from the session 1/10 gg Rockstar.
0;Had hopes of one day modding in VR support for this game for a future playthough. Those dreams have been destroyed with single player mods being a bannable offense now. No point. Don't buy this game unless they decide to let people play a game like it's a game.
0;EDIT Yup been banned again falsely. Definitely don't waste your time with Online.TL DRSingle player is great great character development missions heists etc.Online is just awful too many modders innocent players getting banned (including myself)Would recommend if you like the single player campaign but avoid Online at all costs.
0;Tons of users banned for no reason at all. Banned mods. Literally destroyed the community to just please the console kids who pay to get in game $$$$... .. .../ /) ... .

0;1. Refused to develop single player content post launch.2. Claims to be in favor of single player modding the sole source of user created post launch single player content.3. GTA V Online (PC) was a hackfest that Rockstar did little in the way to correct for years. Causing the online community to drop off sharply.4. New Online DLC comes out for a five year old game and now they're shutting down Single Player Modding?Suck it TakeTwo.
0;Someone should file a lawsuit against Rockstar Games as they ban people from accessing their Online session in some cases when the player has not violated any rules. And after they ban you they wan't you to re purchase the game again for 30 60$ so that they make more money. It is not fair to the people who has to maybe work really hard to buy this game. I am writing this as I am as well banned for no particular reason.
0;Good game but if your internet is anywhere near sub par then doing any other activity that involves internet usage is impossible. Often things fail to render properly which can be horrific if you are flying anything. Would not recommend unless your pc and internet is perfect.
0;First I couldn't even get the damn game to work on my PC due to this game being unoptimized trash. How i even managed to get 200+ hours in this unoptimized trash shocks me. When I did for a short period of time progressing in GTA online is a of a grind and not a fun one to say the least because playing with randoms isn't fun in this game. And to add insult to injury now with Take Two's cokehead executives going against mods now what's the point in going back now?
0;Only things you do in this game make money buy nice car make more money tune nice car make more money and sell last nice car buy nicer car make more money to tune nicer car make money to repair nicer car because some 6 years old kid that stole his mom's card and bought 200 shark cards of 10 million dollars started to spam the s***t out of the space laser on you.I don't recommend this game becuase is purely PAY 2 WIN each and every update is more and more expensive that the last one.
0;It was concerning enough on release that players could and did get banned if they attempted multiplayer with any mods installed. In light of recent events it's obvious Take Two and Rockstar just want to monetize everything at the expense of the players. Don't buy this. Just go play San Andreas again. Don't support this greedy behavior by Take Two and Rockstar.
0;Product received for free. They screwed up the Jester Classic. Im disappointed Rockstar. Who the is in the 3D modeling department. How did you up my Jester Rockstar... YOU!!!!! Ok they fixed the jester but im still not happy with how they stole ideas from mod creators for the Fixed Jester Classic on GTA 5 Mods website.
0;The online part of this game has ruined what could have been amazing. Want to do anything fun? You need money. Want to earn money in game? Prepare to have no time left. It's actually more efficient to get a real part time job to pay for shark cards. This game has become more of a grind than most jobs. Single player is good. Get it in a sale.
0;only giving this game a negative review because of Rockstar's banning issues. I was unexplicably banned for a month and not given any answers. I've never cheated and filed multiple tickets to no avail. This isnt an isolated incident either do some research and you'll find it's happening to more and more people.
0;Interesting story but buried under a horrific slog of grinding repetitive side missions pointless side activities and incredibly fragile cinematic main missions. Watch a movie version or Let's Play on youtube you'll have the best experience. The Online isn't worth it either unless you like grinding even harder to unlock the Heists and have three friends to do them with or want to pay to do them immediately.
0;I have bought this game to play with a friend mostly.I have never modded the game or harrassed anyone it was just a pastime to waste some time with my friend. I was banned wasn't told the reason why and apparently Rokcstar think they can do no wrong since you cannot appeal bans.You are at risk of throwing your money away if you buy this game.
0;Rockstar will ban you for having fun and not buying shark cards. Also the word rockstar is censored online among many other words like and even though this is an M rated game and worse things are said by pedestrians every 30 seconds.edit august 27 2017 Ten million dollars removed for no reason that was all legitimate money. i'm now left with 40k right before a giant expensive update. Support keeps giving me copy pasted responses that are of no help. Not pleased.
0;Until they fix the abhorant banning system this isn't a game anybody should willingly play.I was playing with someone doing MC work and they got banned.However I watch people standing on Mount Chilliad gaining 400 levels within an instant but no issues at all.It's ing disgusting.
0;I purchased this game a while ago and only played single player. I thought it was a great game. I will not be playing multiplayer until microtransactions are removed completely. I believe that anyone should not play any game the has microtransactions and just boycott them all. There are still a few good games left that do not have them. Just don't support them and they will go away. They will have no choice.Do not buy this game if you have not yet.
0;"""For a long while I've belived the game reeks of cash grab so to play nicely I never left a review. Now I know for sure. Once you go after modders you're going after the fans. I already feel milked for my investment but like all other big game companies it's become a take. Pay full price (originally) for a AAA game only to have certain aspects of the game (online) locked behind paywalls and """"sharkcards""""? Just another developer I wont be buying from in the future."""
0;One of there selling points is a open world game that you can do what ever you want. Thanks take two for taking that away. OPEN IV IS FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLY! Single player mods is what made this game series great not online. On behalf of everyone that used mods for single player use only YOU Rockstar and Take Two!

0;Take Two Interactive is a bunch of incompetent bufoons and I cannot in good conscience recommend any game that involves them.Take Two uses predatory tactics to deal with their community.Someone's hacking in the same lobby as you are? You're getting banned.Wanna make mods for their game? Cease and dessist fool.
0;Game Has an Absolutely Terrible Anti Cheat System. Played the game for the first time in over a month for about 2 hours doing some Bunker missions with a friend for about 2 to 3 hours. I log out for a bit to grab some food do some homework and then log back in later to find my account randomly suspended till June 4 2018 and that all my character data will be erased.
0;GTA V is a great game. With a great community. And a *terrible* company. A company that destroys on the community that keeps it going and keeps it in the black. A company that destroys modding tools which are one of the things that made this game great. Don't buy it.
0;Piece of garbage worked just fine last weekend and now when i go to play it the launcher crashesGood game but rockstar needs to get there crap togetherEDIT it works fine for me again but now i hear there banning people for modding!!! what crap its the whole reason i got the game
0;dont bother buying this game...Rock Star will banned you after a while even when there is proof from them that you have done nothing wrong / or no illegal actavities as been found but due to their T&amp C you remain banned for the rest of your life unless you go and spend another few hundrew bucks...so i give it a minus 9.99 out of 10.
0;Have serious lagging issues. It's almost impossible to even drive a car without lagging every other frame. Also no mod support which is one of the main reasons why I bought this game! If I didn't want to mod the appearance of the game I would have just stuck with GTAV for the xbox 360.
0;Grand Theft Auto VThis game's stroy is really really great.But online operating is a messi don't use hack and i don't have hack.but this game banned me online 7 days twice.i hate this game's online operatingwith that reason.i want to question to rockstar gamesbut they always respond over 7 days. Now i hate rockstar games.
0;I got banned for doing nothing wrong i didnt even mod in single player so i dont know why i was banned and i called the owners of the game (RockstarGames) and they said they dont even know why i was banned and i requested a refund from paypal and steam and they both said no. so please do not buy this game it is a scam.
0;The tards called rockstar Grand theft auto V is on sale! with a shark card. Staying at the same price. I know you can do this with the peasants but we are much smarter kind. And i find this offensive You s should put the original game without shark cards on 75% for this t
0;Despite being a great game don't buy this game during the sale if Rockstar are going to raise the price so the people who waited dont get an actual deal this practice is not only bad for the community but bad for the consumer who is only able/ wants to play singleplayer.
0;EDIT Looks like the players won we now have OpenIV back to the general public! DORIGINAL REVIEW Take Two interactive I have one message for you after you shut down OpenIV Go tell your whole team of game creators to themselves.Uninstalling the game until OpenIV is allowed to redistribute their product again.
0;baning for no reasones.. my friends ar starting to get baned one after another and all because of paranoid rockstar for seeing some kind of other programs as hacks.. like discord ubisoft etc.. so if u want to not get baned the only thing u can play is gta.. try not to go in internet or toching any wrong buttons cuz its just like time bomb.. one wrong step and u are fckt..
0;Take Two are clearly just trying to do a money grab. There is no need to block OpenIV with the excuse of 'trying to stop hackers in online'. That's BS. It doesn't stop them. They're trying to sue people instead of actually making a working anti cheat. Don't support this company.
0;Take Two can shove it. I had already decided to never buy one of their games again over a year ago when they actively sought out and banned moderators on modding forums from GTA Online...moderators who had not even developed mods nor used mods in multiplayer. This most recent transgression just further highlights T2's despicable corporate culture. Lads take a note (or two) from Valve's playbook.
0;There's at least one modder on every server because of this there's no point in bothering to try to kill people. It's a good game when people aren't modding when you actually have a decent fight with someone or you do missions or whatever. But Rockstar and Steam both need to be much more vigilant.For this reason i shall not be recommending this game.
0;As others have previously stated the game is great. But with what t we have to put up (raising prices right before a sale constant bugs and glitches even in SP microtransactions that are way too expensive etc.) I believe potential buyers should pass for this one.
0;Sharkcards + No story DLC + Banning players for singleplayer mods + Long load times Cousin lets go bowling instead of playing gta5And now you are sending out cease and desist for mods? Keep red dead redemption 2 on consoles we don't want your trash 2K games on PC.Will not be paying for another 2k or Rockstar game again.
0;There are 2 ways...Way 1 Develop GTA 5Develop Tool ModEarn money by your gameReward Good reviewWay 2 Develop GTA 5Ban a indie Mod ToolEarn money by your gameReward Bad reviewT2 chose the way 2.. then i give them the deserved reward.If they change way i will change reward.
0;Good story line. That's it for the good points. Now for the negatives you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! That's about it.I recommend that everybody downloads the cracked version of this game instead. Rockstar are money s who can't control hackers on their servers.
0;BANNED FROM THIS STUPID GAME FOR NO ING REASON IVE LOST SO MUCH ING PROGRESS IVE PUT SO MUCH ING TIME INTO MY AND MY FULL PLAY TIME DOESNT ONLY INCLUDE THE STEAM VERSION OF ONLINE I HAVE OVER 200 HOURS OF ONLINE GTS FROM THE DVD VERSIOn AND THERE GOES EVERYTHING ING EVERYTHING! WHY THE . I FEEL LIKE IVE BEEEN SCAMMED THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I WANT MY CHARACTER BACK OR A REFUND.
0;I like it when the red water comes out. Rockstar wants to ban me for singleplayer activity. Sorry I do not wish to grind for hours playing the same missions over and over again just to ease my curiosity and see if those vehicles I cannot keep in a garage is cool or not.
0;Take Two decided to take a massive sh!t on the modding community because they want to funnel people into online so that they'll buy microtransactions.GTA is not GTA without OpenIV mods are what makes GTA great and targeting them because they want people to play online is disgusting. If you still want OpenIV you can pirate that sh!t.
0;This game is crap dont waste your money on this crap my friend got banned for literaly nothing he had not taken any money from hackers or even had hacks this is just stupid that how he has to restart all the way form the begining of the game. Now multiple months later i got into a game with a hacker and he turned me into a bad sport so now im not able to play with my friends at all. this game is just so bull crap about the way it does things.
0;Take Two Interactive killed the singleplayer modding community in favor of micro transactions. You've lost all of my respect.Take Two Interactive le ha cerrado las puertas a los mods para el singleplayer. Herramientas como OpenIV ahora son ilegales..https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_ok
0;"""Pros Fun singleplayer just like any other GTA gameCons """"Illegal"""" mod policy from publisherMultiplayer public sessions full of cheatersRandom automated non apealable bans for normal players caused by multiplayer hackingLong and useless loading screens in multiplayer when changing gamesShark cards are cash grab"""
0;Singleplayer was phenomenally solid for its time. Just for that it's worth the money.Multiplayer suffers from a constant feature creep and microtransaction fever. Lack of significant endgame content. Repetative missions and side activities. Regardless some good fun was had with friends.
0;Not recommended. Was permabanned for killing non godded modders 3 times. Do not get this game. It is fun with friends but the support is literally just a bot that copies and pastes and their support number staff only read your ticket and say that it's your own fault. Terrible company bad game.
0;Repeat of same dlc for months that is way too over priced and just for money which no one will buy as its just modders keeping the game alive by giving players moeny and this money was taken just for microtransactions to be used again and then mods were taken out of singleplayer. This game will die if it continues how it is.
0;"""Great game way too many """"modders"""" to be appreciable! I just got online after many weeks of being offline because of it decided to try out a plane I own. As soon as I got out of my hangar a guy teleported into my passenger seat. That was maybe 3 minutes online for 15 spent loading thanks Rockstar!!"""
0;They have completely disabled modding in GTA 5 now. They sent the creators of OpenIV the only GTA modding tool of its kind a Ceast and Desist letter to get them to stop distributing the tool. Now we have to abide by Tyrannical Take Two's rules and play the official online mode which is ridden with complete and utter filth and is a grind fest that can't even shake a finger at World of Warcraft. If you still haven't bought this game. Don't. Just pirate it. Don't give these s any more money.
0;"""Product received for free. I really wanted to enjoy GTA Online but like others say it's a mess. You've got the cheating modders loading screens for days expensive items (over $5k for a paper bag mask really?) lobbies where people aren't patient and leave griefers stupid game mechanics can't steal an """"expensive"""" vehicle to own it etc. GG.Single player is fun for a while at least."""
0;As someone who has grown bored with this game modded gameplay was the only thing drawing any of my interest back to it. Killing off the most popular single player modding group which brought you even more players/revenue is short sighted and simply offensive. I do not recommend this game to anyone at this point as it's played out already and I likely won't play it again myself.
0;gta should have been the story mode with GTA online existing as a entirely different entety that was free as it stands its a AAA priced game that requires insande amount of grinding or a massive amount of disposable money. heists are nice with friends though.
0;www.take2games.com destroying people who want make private servers with mods just becuase they need more money becuase they are not rich already. They doesnt care about people who playing GTA V they just care about money money money money... support this website that we get private servers back! https //www.change.org/p/vote for the authorization of the multiplayer mod gta mp for gta v
0;Can't play more than 10 minutes online because they're using a sh***y peer to peer connections on this AAA title which my modem doesn't like. It shows that every player left when i'm dropped from a session.Lots of multiplayer content but it still feels grindy because of the online prices (vehicles and stuff) are high.I didn't use OpenIV however they killed singleplayer modding which was a mistake as well.
0;Rather than actually adressing the issues of the repetitive grind fest and hacker filled mess that is GTA Online Take Two proceeds to shoot themselves in the kneecaps by removing the only thing possibly keeping this dying game afloat that being modding single player modding at that guising it as the reason why GTA Online is full of hackers but really it's just so they can protect their precious shark cards and continue being jews about it.
0;Banning players who receive a ton of money from hackers is like arresting a drug addict but not his supplier. The drug addict just needs help the supplier is the one ruining people s lives. Go after the supplier not the end user if you want these things to stop.I'm glad they finally lifted the modding ban though.
0;Take Two Interactive has ended modding on this game and they recently bought the rights to Kerbal Space Program and will probably do the same to it. Stay far away until modding is given back. GTA Online is boring and you have to grind to get anything or cough up money to buy shark cards. The only reason they enforce anti hacking is so that people can't spawn in money. CEO of Take Two doesn't even play video games.
0;First it was the Shark cards and now T2 isn't allowing mods. Cool.The thing is GTAV and GTAO should have been seperate from the beginning. Not being able to mod single player is hugely disappointing and is the main reason you're under fire dumb s. Good luck T2 you'll need all of it that you can get your grubby hands on.
0;Cannot Even Have Fun In Single Player Instead Of People At T2 Taking Care Of The Community They Try To Push The Limit Of People Untill It's Tooo Late! Rockstar Should Stand Up For It's Community FOR ONCE NOT TO TRY TO MILK US MORE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE!!!! What About The Modding Communities Like LSPDFR????? T2 And R* For Not Standing up for us once again but for the money!
0;Amazing singleplayer that I have probably spent over 100 hours roaming around in with mods Horrible ban happy multiplayer though as this is the only multiplayer game I have been banned in for modding the singleplayer RIP Online character that I had since around 2014.
0;Take Two is a scummy business. I hate it when corporate greed shuts down something good. Meanwhile millions are cheating ONLINE in your games (which you do NOTHING about) and you can't handle people modding a singleplayer portion? Are you kidding me? RIP Rockstar.
0;you rockstar. Even though I'm not much into modding but shutting down Open IV is BS. If you think it'll help you to get rid of cheaters then you're completely wrong because OpenIV does not affect MP it's only for SP. It will only get worse. I also wanted to mention that MP is not worth playing all you have to do is grind(it's quite boring and exhausting) and of course there are lots of cheaters who want to ruin your game experience.
0;Take2 have taken the most t move that's happened in a long time not only is micro transactions littered every where on online its just pay to win t repetitive unoriginal online content and no single player dlc limiting single player to no updates with new vehicles. Well they've now made modding it illegal. t.
0;well as a start. my game worked but the online mod didn't after a while the game itself didnt work eather.no much to say just think twice before you buy somthing in 60 box.and if anybody can tell me how to fix the game/ get refound it will be very helpful.thx.
0;things that i hated when the game just came out Year long loading time cheaters / hackers over priced Online things because of SharkCard Pay2Win systemThey didn't change a thing now. just the fact that they want to destory our modding tools is too much for me.I will still 'try' to play this game but i won't buy any new game from R* or T2
0;Dear head of the Take Two InteractiveFrom the supporters of OpenIV and all of those who have been unfortunate enough to have ever made contact with you.Please find the nearest body of water where you can fit your thick head in and keep it under the water until everything goes blank. I know it will be hard due to how empty that dome of garbage you call a head is but for the love of god Do it for the poor souls who might have to deal with your dumbass in the near future.Sincerely VoodooChille
0;this game was amzing in the past but unfortnately its not now online mode has been overrun my modders and items you cant afford without buying sharkcards at this point it seems like rockstar are milking the game for as much money as they can before it dies very disapointing updates with very very expensive items and the story mode is just the same old story so thats boring as well.i would not reccomend this game to anyone unless rockstar fixes these major issues you will regret it
0;This f*ucking lame game crashed many times. One of which we have 4 remaining players 2 of which are duo. In the middle of 2 vs me this game crashed. Whhyy?? Aside from that we also have some issues with rubber banding not accurate hits and cheaters. This game prioritized crates skins and keys. Clearly they're after the money.
0;The story was fun but offered little more.If you have some friends to play with it is really fun however if you play in a public you will be plauged by modders and greifers that will ensure that it is nearly unplayable accept breifly after major updates. It is also built to promote microtansactions in a game that you already paid for.
0;Finally started playing gta again after the new update had modded money that was spawed on top of me but probz only spent it on upgrades to the new nascar beacuse ive been playing alot of the new racers but once again GTA just d**ks everyone and will probz not be playing this game again. Keep up the great work Rockstar
0;dont buy this game if you are on budget talking about gta online it is full of hacker and it is hard to connect to any game mode and i got banned 3 times (the last ban was permanent) for no reasons lol i didnt use any kind of cheats or hacks or glitches ty rockstar for banning me instead of banning the many hackers in your gameanyway if you want to play the game just downalod the pirated version to play the story because the online is and it just becomes worse every update they release
0;I really want to like the game single player is awesome but online is unplayable. You can hang around do whatever but it's impossible to do any MC or CEO activities. As soon as you start a mission a modder is going to ruin it for you. Rockstar Games does a really bad job on stopping it. There are modders in 9/10 lobbies at any time of the day. It would be very easy to have a handful of people to monitor this and ban any modder on sight. Can't recommend at all right now.
0;The story mode of this game is great the optimization and gameplay are also great. I can't reccomend this game though. RockStar's awful practices in online multiplayer are unbelievably pathetic. You can spend hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours in this game only to have it all wiped and reset on strike one. The best part? If a hacker decides to... Oh I don't know... drop money on your head YOU get punished for it. Strike two and you're permanently banned with no appeal.
0;Bought several copies of this game spent both hundred of dollars and hours in it with friends only to get banned and my character deleted without any disclosure as to why or ability to explain my side. Buyer beware this game will screw you out of your money without any warning and say it is your fault
0;Since they killed off 65 percent of their playerbase just by stopping anytthing related to OpenIV this game is not recomended due to them destroying some fantastic modders and mods... I truly feel bad for the modders since most of what they worked for is gone... you and burn in hell Take Two. Go to your local gun store buy a glock and kill yourselfs Step on a lego you
0;Modders create economic inflation. They create chaos virtually in every activity you join &amp ruin public servers. Not all of them mod to mess with people but so many people mod that you need a menu to play this game without getting bullied. R* isnt going to do anything about it. What's the point in releasing these new game modes/stunt races when someone with a menu will just teleport everyone into the ocean?
0;"""Pretty okay game had some fun in it.Play the online though and it's obvious how many opportunities were missed in favor of trying to make as much money as possible for little to no effort and now it's extended to outright punishing people trying (in spite of game design ) to play it legitimately.Voting with your wallet is sacrilege in today's """"buy everything"""" world but seriously Skip this. The game isn't worth supporting a business."""
0;Wonderful game...on consoleWould be extremely awesome if the devs would actually take the time to look into peoples game directory before wrongfully banning people.If you want to play gta 5 SP buy this game! However do not waste your money if you plan to play online.
0;I don't understand you release a single player game don't release any single player content so you can nickel and dime people with whale cards in your grindy online mode then you come down on people trying to breathe new life into your game and create single player content for your game all for free?Good way to alienate your fanbase.
0;I understand cracking down on modders online but banning a modding tool that is primarily used for single player mods is the wrong move to go about. I and a lot of people brought this game on PC primarily for modding and now that option is gone this game is of little use in terms of playability in terms of single player content.
0;Not everyone likes multiplayer. So aside from the distinct LACK of singleplayer content the debacle of screwing over the SP modding community is basically the final straw. You want a good fast paced huge open world third person shooter? BUY JUST CAUSE 3. It also has a hookshot which makes gameplay more fun.
0;1st is the Updates and The ban system they literally ban random players who think they cheated while playing online 2nd they are freaking greedy with their In game vehicles Weapons Homes cost alot of money that encourages other player gonna buy sharkcards....Yousonofa !3rd they close the OpenIV source code from modders for what? To prevent them to improve the game of course and more money was in this game.
0;i was doing heist and mission with my friends after that i was going to buy some dress. i bought same pants twice and i got banned 10 days i ask them why have i been banned ? they told me u're using glitch cheat modding. actually i didnt use any glitch cheat mod. they can investigate my account but they didnt. i told it to them but they didnt recognized me so dont buy this game its so suck . they cant interested be in about the game.
0;Take two and rockstar have done nothing but us all since release. Banned me off online even thought i was only on my first warning now the game is essentially useless to me. And on top of that there trying to take down OpenIV. Never buying anything from these frauds again...
0;I don't understand where it was a good idea to remove a key mod to the community. Look at Bethesda. How long has skyrim lasted? Think about how long that game has lasted. The reason? Mods. In other words your decision was not intelligent in the slightest. Enjoy the reviews and loss of community. You should be working on stopping all the hackers instead.
0;"""I'm leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team. OpenIV is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE ammount of mods for Gta V and Gta IV. Basically modding is """"illegal"""" so I am leaving this negative review. The game is okay but this """"No Modding Policy"""" is ridiculous and I will not stand for it."""
0;Filled with microtransactions and hackers... hmm are those two words connected? Don't buy also Take Two Interactive decided to bully not developers to stop developing mods that ultimately make the game more enjoyable. I'm glad to know the devs have our best interest at heart. Bottom line Don't support a garbage company. Want a good game? Bethesda is a good place to start.
0;Love the GTA series I've played almost all of them since I got a console. I bought GTA V for pc for the modding potential but with the recent news regarding OpenIV and how modding is basically dead I can't recommend it. Honestly if you're planning on getting GTA V then I would recommend waiting until Take Two Interactive stops ****ing over modders because what they did is unreasonable and honestly completely unforgivable.
0;Take Two says that they need to monetize more.The first thing they do is to destroy one of the selling points of the games they own. Well done. Well f*cking done there. Enjoy watching your ratings plummet.I was looking forward to Red Dead 2. Won't be buying it now.You need to learn some humility Take Two.
0;Wrongfully banned from online play years ago for someone forcefully dropping money on my player (I assume this is why)The game is just a cash grab at this point every update takes months to be fully released and is full of useless content that costs a ridiculous amount of in game money to buy forcing players to buy shark cards or resort to cheating.
0;gta 5 online just wont ing loadi played the story mode that is fine but the ing online mode wint let me ini asked for a refund and they are like u have exceded 2 hr of game playi spent 30 min on story mode and the rest 2.30 hr was just ing loading screen for gta onlineim so frustrated with this
0;Mods are back but guess what? I won't be buying the next Rockstar game. Skyrim SE a 64 bit version of an almost 6 year old game is in the top sellers list for a reason pay attention. You have shown that all you care about is money when trying to stop modding and you poo'd on the fanbase. My $$$ goes elsewere from now on.
0;The game was fun when it came out but now its just a money grab with every new addition to the game costing more money. The worst part is that every online session you connect to has a 12 year old with got mode that just sits around trying to kill you.
0;Well you just screwed your revenue. Good job take two and rockstar you got rid of the #2 reason people bought this game.Modders and Open IV were peaceful and stuck to single player. The Modding Community didn't even contribute to hacking. Open 4 prohibited you from launching online.It was great until nowGTA 5 is extremely limited without the moding community.I hope you learn from this.
0;"""probably the worst community of players of any game. I don't mean """"oh people kill you because its GTA"""". no most lobbies you will be in online are full of truly toxic people. a waste of money if you do not have a group of friends you plan to play with. toxic toxic cancer causing jerks."""
0;"""Whats that? Do I see damage control from TakeMyMoney? Theyre allowing mods again? How nice of them still... people wont forget this """"Apparently they werent milking the Online mode enough so they just shuted down every single mod for GTA V. Well played TakeMyMoney.""""Game is great publishers are awful"""
0;The single player experience is not what I bought this for.So my review cannot apply to that aspect.I love this game and have poured tons of money and time into playing the multiplayer online experience.Bottom LineThey took 1.7 million dollars of legit money from a friend I grinded it with.I hear that people have gotten their money back but those are special cases.
0;Rockstar makes everything 30 times what it should cost and does not provide any legitimate way to make enough money to buy the dlc. Then rockstar blames modderd for modding when in actuallity modding would not be nearly as much of a problem if one could legitimately make enough money to buy all the fun things in the game. Never NEVER buy this game. it is just a greedy excuse for an online game.
0;Its a grindfest/ pay to win now. Wallet warriors run and it takes literally weeks to buy some of the more expensive stuff. Cool if you have friends to play with but get REAL boring REAL quick with solo play. Because of the success of shark cards we will never get another solid GTA without pay to win options.
0;Modding makes Grand Theft Auto fun after you finish the story and get tired of the repeditive grinding that is online (or you must buy Shark Cards). And since they ed the modding community by stopping OpenIV I would not advice to buy this game. Oh and before I forget. you Take Two. Greedy Edit yes. We won. Modding and openIV are now allowed again and I would recommend this game again. I will not remove this review as a reminder for them.
0;Mods are the only reason most people buy this game on PC and attempting to remove that is the worst idea you could have but I guess the $60 everyone paid for this game that is the 3rd best selling game of all time wasnt enough and the microtransaction hell hole that is multiplayer isnt making enough. So you have to make the singleplayer as as possible by not including features like the hydra and then make mods not work just so people play the multiplayer and pay you money.
0;Screw you for banning my online account I'm already mad enough with that. Right now you wanna bann offline mods?! WHAT THE IS WRONG WITH YOU GTA survived thank to the modding community and mods are the main attraction to people who are interested to play with. There are soo many hackers online all thanks to your overpriced dlc things and sky is the limit sharkcards price it's all your fault causing hackers to appear online. YOU.
0;if you're gonna buy the game for the single player exprience then go ahead single player is amazing and worth the 60 dollars.Online is terrible hackers tryhards overpirced...well everything.Yea maybe its fun with a group a friends but even then its eh
0;There's nothing wrong with the game itself and its actually a good game when the developers aren't actively trying to you and ruin any possible fun you could have which they do ALL THE TIME EVEN BEFORE THIS OPEN IV TRAINWRECKno wonder people are fed up with this garbage
0;Take two interactive has offically made modding this game illegal. If you can't mod a game then what's the point. Also GTA Online sucks anyways. Thank god I got this stupid game at a discount. Sorry take two. You holes are money hungry bastards who diserve nothing from me. Go yourselfs royally. It's a good game but it gets very boring fast. If you are going to buy this game buy it at an EXTREME discount. It's not worth $60. This game is only worth $20 now if that.
0;At this point in the game it is not worth it to get into. There are generally too many hackers which can get extremely tiresome. Along with that it will take an exceptionally long time to obtain the late game items especially with the recent updates. As in it can take easily 50mil for everything from the recent updates at minimum.
0;ohboytimetoboycottLook GTA V (The Singleplayer) is a great game made by talented people. But now they've killed modding the main reason many people who already had a console copy of the game buy the PC Version.I would not suggest giving Take Two any money at this point until they resolve this.(Context http //openiv.com/?p 1324)
0;I have been suspended for 1 month with no reason i didn't violate any eula policies nor used mods. and my characters in online would go undergo a reset. Rockstar would you mind helping me out in this situation? any reply would be appreciated.Thank you very much.
0;I'm gonna have to hit this with a negative rating. I loved the story but online is so tedious and time consuming with very little reward. After the Gunrunning update rockstar randomly took seven million out of my bank account even though I busted my for that cash. I'm getting older and I don't have time to play a 10 minute misson to only get around 20k out of it. I guess they really captured how expensive LA really is. Also TakeTwo.
0;Pros Single Player is a lot fun so I do Recommend Single Player All three Protaganists are really great. Graphics Draw distance Map size truly amazing So much to do. Cons Loading Screens for Online take forever and fail a lot of the time. The GTA V Online community is comprised of trolls hackers and idiots. The Grind is NOT worth it hence Shark Cards for more RL $$$.
0;so many cheater in online game immortal and invisible man so I really mad about this..so if u (GTA 5) wanted life longer please fix this bugs....!!!!!!!!and I cannot play with my friend in the online game when I start the mission at the club my friend was left always happen.and I get boring about this..!!
0;No Single Player support of any kind.Take Two Interactive and their Subsiderary Rockstar Games have banned ALL modding including single player no doubt in an attempt to drive any remaining solo players to the Online mode where they have to either grind for eternity or buy countless sharkcards.This is nothing but a move for them to capitalise more on players. Which is no surprise following the head of Take Two Interactive's recent comments claiming they were undermonitising users.
0;If you're buying it for single player thats fine online part however filled with modders way too high prices to buy anything it's grinding the heists over and over again until you have enough money to buy a house or a car but by that time you're going to get bored because no other activity or mission provides enough money to buy anything and you're stuck doing heists over and over again.
0;I play this game game primarily for single player specifically to mod it. Take Two has essentially said that modding is illegal. For that they can go themselves. Don't buy this game. Don't support Rockstar or Take Two if you have any kind of integrity going forward I know I won't. Enjoy your millions of dollars Take Two. Don't expect to get that kind of money from PC gamers again.
0;Slow to load. Multiplayer is meh purposely designed to push players towards putting more money into it. Harsh on the good kinds of modders and don't seem to give a about the hackers that ruin the game for everyone. It's fun but I'm slowly becoming more and more dissapointed with the direction that the developers are taking this in.
0;Okay lets get started here. First thing i want to go over is that my computer reaches the reccomended specs. This game is fun and all regarding the hackers or modders i simply can't like this game for the fact it crashes way to much. Everything is fine except the connection issuses crashing hackers. If you can live with those things and have fun with them then sure go ahead and buy the game. But purely i find this game very fun when i don't crash or anything like that.
0;REVIEW FOR THE ONLINE VERSION What the actual happened with this game. After a one year break I tried playing some online with my friends. We spent over one hour trying just to join THE SAME LOBBY WITHOUT ONE OF US DISCONNECTING. And this was not our fault the game kept disconnecting us until we gave up and came here writing this review. Eat my rosckstar games.
0;"""I've played GTA V for countless hours on Xbox 360 and transfered to PC later after reaching rank 100. One month later I get suspended and my account was reset and the reason given was that I """"cheated"""". I have never modded or cheated before so this really shows how bad their system is."""
0;Once again Rockstar does an outstanding job with their update. I especially love the fact that they banned modding EVEN IN SINGLEPLAYER!!!! Oh and the fact that they took away so many peoples legit money (8m to 40k overnight) and that the economy is so inflated because of the modders that is almost essential to mod now. FFS it cost 3.5m for a motorcycle now...
0;I bought this game with the intention of modding it just like I did with GTA IV but with Take 2 gutting that I no longer wish to play. Online is a cheater infested pile of crap and you need one to get anywhere without spending stupid amounts of money on shark cards which is a waster of money. Screw you Take 2. Modifying Single Player hurts nothing but your profits which clearly shouldn't matter because you've sold more than 75 million copies.
0;Single player is good but Take Two who own Rockstar have turned the Online mode into a cash shop mess with grinding for overpowered armoured cars and fighter jets and the money earned playing the game losing value so you have to buy shark cards instead. Take Two now have sent a Cease &amp Desist order to modders basically ruining the modding scene and making the game unmoddable. Take Two took a gaming classic and ruined it for money.
0;Screw Take Two etc. Why even bother making a single player game if you don't release single player content like you said you would and instead entirely focus your resources on milking the hell out of GTA O? Which hackers still run rampant in?Take Two is the new EA. Let that sink in for a second.
0;Rampant hacking and cheating in online play wich Rockstar does nothing about. Modders duplicate cars and spawn in infinite amounts of money as well as having control over the game world. On an official rockstar lobby you can be minding your own business playing and suddenly you are removed from your car and frozen so you can't move/shoot etc or have your character transformed into a giant block of concrete or spontaneously lit on fire... And there is nothing you can do about it.
0;What the hell is wrong with mods recently?! I feel like all the big devs have jsut noticed this cake that has been sitting there and has either thought 'Gonna get me some of dat!' or 'This cake has been around for some time! It has be very dirty! We shall get rid of it!' off Take two
0;T2 is a greedy company that doesn't care about the happiness of its costumers rather how much money they can ing make. I highly recommended this game but if you're going to mod DON'T BUY IT T2 is ing money hungry. OPEN IV deserves to stay T2 deserves to go
0;Despite my hours I have on this game and the fun times I have had and as much as I like supporting Rockstar I cannot and will not support Take Two Interactive any further with their decision to shutdown OpenIV. Hope you rot in hell you greedy corporate bastards.
0;I enjoyed this game for a few years now but now that about 70% of the mods dont exist I do not recommend it for players that finish the story line or own it on another platform. This is a clasic example of a company trying to limit the end user experence and forcing them to purchace future DLC to continue enjoying the game.
0;Until Rockstar launches a legitimate anti cheat I do not recommend this game to those wishing to have fun online. It is a pain to get a lobby with no money hackers or just straight up a holes. The singleplayer is pretty fun and a good time waster before work.
0;Modding is one of the strongest pillars of the PC community in almost any game. The time and effort that people spent creating their own content for the single player version of this game have gone completely to waste. These individuals did nothing but help your game receive further sales and helped us to get more enjoyment out of the game. I will refuse to give any more money to any game company that refuses to embrace harmless player mods on PC.
0;I had 6 million dollars fair gotten but in the next update rockstar decieded to remove all my ing money !!! dont buy you will spend alot of time and then going to get ed over by rockstar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not even talking about it crashing every mission i try to play and before you say upgrade your pc . i have a high end 6000$ pc

0;"""""""Take Two"""" (GTA Online devs) essentially banned modding for this game while I never modded GTA5 something like """"paid mods"""" cough Bethesda shouldn't be supported...UPDATE I guess they backed off a little but sounds like they can still sue modders if they wanted..."""
0;RIP MODS glad to see that mabey GTA 5 wont be in the Top Ten Charts for once as the deserve to never be again just ridiculous i hope some people get fired for this we the community are not happy lets make sure we show it and make them come crawling back on there knees begging for our business BACK
0;I originally bought this version of GTA to mod singleplayer. And that ONLY. Not to cheat in online. So now that openiv has been shutdown I really have no point in playing this anymore. Thanks T2 for wasting my time and money.P.S. I'd rather be able to pay my bills than have an ingame object. Thanks.
0;Been playing GTA since 2007 always enjoyed modding especially in GTA IV and GTA SA now Take Two has shut down OpenIV and ruined alot of potentially good mods that would keep the single player in GTA V alive as Rockstar doesn't seem to want to release a SP DLC anytime soon because of Online.
0;After three years of playing the most recent title from our friends at Rockstar games with great regret i would not advise buying this game. Not because of any problems within the game or anything related to the game. but it's because of the recent C&amp D against OpenIV a modding tool for GTAV &amp GTAIV. i enjoy this game along with millions of others across many platforms but this has truly soured my thoughts on Take Two and Rockstar.
0;I didn't pay for this game with my hard earned money to play only what you wish.. Multiplayer. It's painfully obvious from Rockstar and Take Two that you are blatantly dishonest with your actions against OpenIV. No attempt to even contact the OpenIV team! I bought this game for the mod support it offers. Very greedy and unprofessional.
0;Take two has essentially killed the entire modding community. GTA V has a great singleplayer but without mods there is simply no replayibility to it. They are forcing players onto GTA online to milk more money from them through microtransactions and shark cards. If something isn't done about this you can expect this to be the downfall of GTA. Sad to see such a great game fall apart.
0;Take Two ruined it now that they took down OpenIV. No more modding which is one of the biggest GTA communities. Do not recommend now that they are basically pushing you into microtransactions and making the game pay to win. If they allow OpenIV then I would recommend it.
0;As of now Rockstar and Take Two have done everything possible to ensure that I will never buy another game from them again! The way they treat their community is awful and shows once and for all that they care for nothing more than to just continue milking GTAO. Willing to bet their in the process of making paid mods of thier own with Bethesda and Microsoft hot on the scene.I do NOT recommend buying ANY Rockstar/Taketwo product EVER.
0;Product received for free. As a lifelong GTA fan with thousands of hours in each title it pains me to say Take Two can shove it for sending a C&amp D to OpenIV developers. We the community have made this franchise what it is today not only you Take Two. OpenIV may be gone but we're still here and OpenIV 2 is on the way.
0;"""About a month or two ago I probably would have been writing a positive review for this. But now? I honestly can't support Take Two or Rockstar anymore. Not only did they send the cease and desist to OpenIV but they also """"adjusted"""" the accounts of my friends and I causing us to lose two to four million each of legitimate cash. All because a modder gave them maybe 600k."""
0;Take Two's cease and desist on OpenIV is a blantant attack on the modding community and gamers. Modders keep games alive and it is a cornerstone in the gaming community. I cannot support Rockstar or Take Two because they clearly do not support gamers.
0;Done just done. As if it's not bad enough that R* games feel PC is an atrocity that doesn't deserve their games and any kind of proper story expansion will never happen thanks to the cash cow of GTA Online now Take Two decided to basically ban modding.Just... to hell with this game and it's makers/publishers.
0;The singleplayer is fine a great GTA game but this openIV mod stuff just made it's single player a bit worse. On the mulitplayer front the gameplay is fun but the grind is insane and the 'micro' transcations cost enough for you to be better off buying a real house instead of getting some ingame money.
0;I bought this game three times one for previous generationone for THIS gen and the PC version for Modding and generally having fun in single playerand they do this as a show of gratitude?? you Take Two... you can take a number 2 on yourself and any future products you release...
0;How to GTA Online fun game doing stupid stuff with friends poorfag.jpeg doing hours of jobs to earn cash cuz shark cards is finally enough money to buy fun stuff hacker in server doing hacker stuff giving us ufo's as hats and lollygags leaves server cuz dont wanna get banned logs on next day all money gone from bank rockstar took it all creates ticket on legendary support site gets standard generated answer back hidden answer saying to myself5/7
0;Single Player great Multiplayer flooded with microtransactions everything is exspencive and take weeks of grinding just to buy a house. Lets hope RDR2 is not like this if so then #boycotttake2games Also to add T2I killed single player modding so the fun has died.
0;If you think punishing your single player fanbase by putting a stop to a decade of modding is going to clean the cheaters out of your money hungry Online component you're even more out of touch than this move makes you look.And if it's because paid mods are back in the spotlight and you're doing this until you figure out how you can take a slice you should take a look at how paid mods were received in the past.
0;Shark cards have ruined this game idiots that bought them should fall on a sword. It is almost impossible to make money in game becasue they want you to buy the money via shark cards and when the community finds a way to make money rockstar patches the game to stop you. A friends account was ban for no reason other than useing a flying car mod in a invite only session literally gone had to buy a new copy. what he heck rockstar jsut make a cheaters only room dont take the game from us.
0;Good game ruined by corporate greed. I've hated what Take Two has done to this game even before the OpenIV dilemma. LETS ADD A ON OF THINGS TO SPEND MONEY ON BUT NO WAYS TO EARN MONEY EFFICIENTLY BESIDES SHARK CARDS. Turned Online into a cash grabbing disgrace. I genuinely fear for Red Dead Redemption 2 because the same morons are in charge. Don't support these s. I'm glad I didn't spend a cent on their stupid shark cards.
0;Take Two and Rockstar greed will not prevail on this platform.Much love for the hard work and dedication of the OpenIV team throughout the years. Although I have never personally used your tool I support you because you created it out of love for these games.
0;GTA V for the most part is a good game. But a few poor design and business choices make the single player experience seem incomplete and the online mode downright frustrating. I keep coming back to this game expecting something more but the daily grind of GTA Online just isn't satisfying and the story is still plagued by bugs reported back in 2013.My advice is buy one of its competitors because despite this game's colossal budget and success it still can't provide a complete experience.
0;This is now going to become a boycott against this product because of Take two interactive cutting off almost all mods so 'em if you wanted to buy this game DONT DO IT not until they fix what needs to be fixed and cutting off mods from SINGLE PLAYER yes you read right SINGLE PLAYER is not going to fix the game.
0;With the cheats this game has installing mods was arguably the way to go. It made the singleplayer much less tedious and much more fun. I'm sad (and mad) to see that Take Two has decided to strike out against something that has enabled gamers to play this series the way they want for nearly ten years. Though I love this game for how it plays I can't support this decision. It's not the same without mods.
0;Take Two's stance on fan created content that contributed to the game as well as their obsession with squeezing every penny out of the customer's pockets through microtransactions leads me to say that this game is not recommended. Play it if you have it already but if you don't don't buy it and sure as HECK don't buy any microtransactions. It isn't worth it.
0;While this game has had a very long lifespan its lack of innovation and focus on extracting cash from your wallet makes me not reccomend this game at this point. Furthermore the publisher is very paranoid about mod usuage but has done nothing of substance to limit the rampant cheating online.
0;Today someone raised the rank of all the players on the session i was playing (48 to 466 in my case) .I've opened a request to Rockstar to revert my account to my former state. I won't play untill this is sorted .This review will remain negative untill then.
0;"""To be serious the story mode is playableThe online mode is full of hackers and people who bought an """"unlock all""""An Unlock all is an account which has extremly high money you can buy this with 10 .However pretty much all people use some jets or other high cost things to kill new guys.If you want to play something in which you don't have spended 500 frustrating hours of playing and get killed only then this is definetly not the game you want to play."""
0;Do not ing buy this as fun as the single player is you should not be giving money to those scumbags at Take two. For those unaware take two (whow own rockstar) have filed a cease &amp desist on open iv the mod that makes it possible to do the crazy most mods do. Whowever is reading this most likely would be buying this game for the mods yet take two feel the need to be unlikeable .
0;"""I used to recommend this game. But now that the modding is gone there's no point anymore. Unless you have a few hundred to spend on Shark cards or plan on spending all your free time playing to try to be a pro player the online is pointless. It's a bunch of kids who have nothing else to do than kill everyone else and spend all their parent's money to """"be better than everyone""""."""
0;rockstar resently corrected my account money by 900.000 $. i didnt do any glitch or abuse. i didnt meet any modder or took any cheated money. so no i do not recommend this game because over the world rockstar deleted billions of hours of ingame work.thx....
0;How to kill gta step 1. Add gunrunning with its explosive snipers.step 2. Add Smugglers run with its ridiculously overpowered planes that can devastate people on the ground because rockets cant catch up to planes and the new planes have flares if the rockets somehow get close to them.step 3. Profit because everyone buys shark cards now.Still gonna play it tho
0;First lobby I entered after the OpenIv ban still had cheaters in it. (two to be exact) +1 for off the entire community while doing nothing to secure your game. GTAV online is easier to hack than the DNC.edit Guess they are backing off of OpenIv which is good but it's still pay/cheat to win.
0;Due to the fact Take Two have issued a cease and desist message to the 10 year old OPEN IV modding tool I am downvoting GTA V and I urge others to do the same. The modding community have always thrived in GTA games but this just goes without saying that without OPEN IV the rest of the Mod creators future work and current work will now be made irrelevant. Strauss Zelnick and Take Two have crossed a line.
0;Product received for free. I did a doomsday heist and did not get the cash money. That wasn't very cash money of you rockstar I lost 760K I took a Phat L on this oneI tried to do Act 3 but now it just says Rockstar services are unavaliable cucked part 2 electric boogalooValidated my files and nothing works so spent 120K on the setup just for it to say services are unavaliable Cucked by RockstarPHAT L
0;With the amount of flaws that this game has it is quite shocking that this is infact the most anticipated title of all time.Hell had neither the series been so god damn famous or had this game not been bearing the title of GTA then no way in hell could Rockstarever have gotten away with something like this.
0;Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games just destroyed the game that i put hunderts of hours with a poorly written statement. Don't expect no sympathy from me anymore. I will never buy any of your games anymore no matter how beautiful it is. #boycottRdR2
0;From June 2017 if you wish to play this game with mods which in my opinon made GTA so big on the PC platform than don't even. The tools used to give the consumer such vast amount of freedom and fun in singleplayer have now been taken down by take two the owners of rockstar thus making this game pointless and un recommendable.
0;I literally only bought this ing game because of the LSPDFR mod. I may as well shut my goddamn Twitch channel down now because that mod accounted for 90% of my freaking content. I honestly hope Take Two burns in hell for this. I'm at least glad I didn't buy KSP and only have the demo. It's like this that makes people pirate games. Absolutely ridiculous. Take Two go yourselves.
0;OpenIV gets a cease and desist so there goes moddingGameplay is very lacking in comparison to GTA 4Online is filled with loading screens a broken party system and cheaters.No singleplayer DLC and a lack of multiplayer content onlineOverall 4 beats 5 any day of the week
0;Grand theft auto has long been one of my favorate games but the attack on OpenIV (modding platform which allows us to make singleplayer how we enjoy it) has led me to not recommend this game. I bought this game on PC to play things like LSPDFR and mod it. This game's the perfect platform for it but this uncalled for attack of the modding community and anti consumerism is just sad. Remove the Cease and Desist letter for your own good and the communities or your going to lose a huge fanbase.
0;Modding is dead but hey at least you can go online for the promise of meeting hackers who will reset all of your legitimate progress while escaping scott free participate in an activity you hate but have few alternatives to if you want to make any 'real' money or when you get tired of either of those give Take Two even more real real money on top of what you paid for this game.It's Rockstar certified satire come to life like never before.
0;your online content sucks and the game is dying because of hackers. So how about you fix that before ing up the only thing this game is good for .. the story and the mods. By the way you guys for not updating the single player with weapons and vehicles from multiplay. seems like something simple to do.
0;Singleplayer is good. But the game shouldn't be so expensive this many years after release and the multiplayer is irredemably . Throw that with the fact that there's no singleplayer dlc and take2 just killed the modding scene I don't recommend this game.
0;They pulled the plug on modding 10 years into it which is extremely not cool. I only played the game with mods. If I had known the extent of the countless moneygrabbing DLC's and the anti modding stance the devs took I'd have torrented the game years ago and saved myself 60 bucks.
0;Nice going Take Two.EDIT OpenIV is back.My review remains negative. The fact they ever attempted to ban singleplayer mods in the first place is disgusting and their knee jerk takeback is nothing more than an attempt to save face.The next in the series had better be fantastic for me to even think about buying it and supporting a company like this.Sorry Rockstar has to deal with the repurcussions of this bad press given to them by their parent company.
0;Single player used to be good anyway.Multiplayer public sessions were overflowed by cheaters but privat sessions were solution once. And a calm harbor for some RP stuff &amp players. And some honest modders who liked fun much over cheating crap. I guess even single player isn't an option with new hype train against Take2 modding policy. RIP GTA V.
0;Oh hey R* is doing another christmas event this year... Joins free roam lobby Gets imprisoned by modder Modder steals all the money from my bank account Rest of lobby laughs at my misfortune Just GTA V on christmas things.Seriously this game and it's community.
0;This game sucks!it was a great game these days but now... nah dont buy it..bluehole turnd into EA 2.0adding skins and a season pass?! just for the money. And while adding these things the game isnt even done yet... full of bugs . random disconnects cars are still gliching as hell and its completly desynct...ahh and one more point its full of hackers...
0;This game is awful. Its run by money grabbers The Online content is a grind of the same rewrapped and reheated coupled with problems and issues by modders and hackers. The ingame content is hugely over priced ($2000 for a T Shirt) and the stunt tracks and races are nothing short of programming that counldn't see past Sonic the Hedgehog.
0;i did enjoy this game but now with what take two and rockstar are doing to the modding scean well it just ruins the game. also there idea of the fact that take two thinks there undermonetizing the games that BROUGHT A 40 GAME. this is just wrong very bad.
0;What was once game of the year literally every year is not but a shadow of it's former self. All because Take Two Interactive stopped a core value of PC gaming. Modding. Teams of programmers who worked non stop to bring us OpenIV and FiveM have had their work stamped on by Take Two.This decision has no monetary impact on them and costs them no money. Their decision is unjust. you Take Two.
0;I didn't pay 60$ to play a grindfest. Granted there is a single player but Take two is taking away any incentive to actually play said single player if you haven't played it already. I'd recommend this game whenever Rockstar pulls it's head out of it's butt and releases a single player DLC like they promised a few years ago.
0;Rockstar is killing mods increasing in game prices and decreasing in game payouts. Paying $60 for a game to have most of its features locked behind a paywall is ridiculous and stupid. It isn't fun. Until Rockstar decides to care about the community and consumers the game is just a desperate cash grab.
0;Loved the GTA franchise not anymore. The reason so many copies of GTA IV were sold was because of modding and I was dissapointed to see how they handled modders in GTA 5 but it wasn't enough to rustle my jimmies. NOW that they decided to go a step beyond turning the back to modders and actually banning them. I am afraid of the future of the franchise. TLDR Don't buy the game Don't buy cards and don't pre order their upcoming games.
0;When you get yourself banned for no reason (no hacks no kills casual gaming) and not even 1 reason given for the perma ban... maybe it's time to move on to other game.PS after this ban i dont expect thay can remove cheater from the game... not when you ban those that d'ont use cheats.Good luck.
0;Game started out fine until I ran into a bug that causes a mission to automatically fail as soon as the mission start cut scene ends. I know this mission is the one to unlock the michael character to play so I'm stuck with just Franklin. Tried starting the game over from the beginning several times to see if anything would change but it hasn't. I don't know what's causing this bug but unless it gets fixed I consider this game a waste of time and money.
0;"""Do you like auto aim using level 150s with armored Kurumas that will do anything to """"rek"""" you? What about a horrible balancing system that will pit level 10s against 200s? Now add in semi auto instant kill sniper rifles and you've GTA online. Singleplayer is alright tho."""
0;well if your getting this game for modding like i did well then if i were you id skip it but if your fine with a (imo bland game) vehicle wise then go ahead and get it. but its just not to good to me have everything i need installed and it crashes every 3 5 minutes so i just cannot recommend it if you want to mod Ps. i only have vehicles and spg (single player garage)
0;Take Two sent OpenIV project a Cease and Desist order proving they are completely hostile to PC Gamers and passionate Modders who've devoted years of their time and energy into making fun projects and mods to play and enhance our games with. I will not be supporting any Take Two owned brands in the future because of this pathetic zealotry against modders.DO NOT BUY OR SUPPORT. TAKE TWO AND ROCKSTAR THREATEN MODDERS WITH LEGAL ACTION.
0;Rockstar is anti gamer and anti fun. They only care about accumulating shark card shekels and all the changes they made to GTA Online recently reflects this. And now making mods illegal this company has finally lost me. Glad i won't waste any more time on this boring as hell online game.
0;I bought this game on Xbox 360 AND Xbox One. I bought it on my PC in no small part to be able to mod it. In sending a cease and desist for OpenIV a SINGLEPLAYER ONLY modding tool Take Two has taken a big part of that away.Take Two has become greedy GTA Online has become a tool for selling Shark Cards. Anyone with a job or family doesn't have time necessary to afford anything in Online unless they spend several times the cost of the game buying Shark Cards. It's ridiculous.

0;dnt buy this game...too many modders ruining lobbies plus this game has poorly optimized graphics and bad network..frame drops and frequent disconnection has a major problem on this game and not to mention the mod used by hackers which can see your ip address while in lobbies so its a no no so do some research before diving head first...remember modders and hackers are supreme in this game not the rockstar itself.
0;You Take Two!OpenIV made the game alot better and all you want to do is screw everyone over who bought the game just to mod. you! You ruined R* and you're turning into the abominated TUMOR that is EA games!I hope you learn something from this! DON'T WITH US!
0;"""30h in and i have yet to find lobby online that has no scripter/hacker/modder in it .im realy disapointed about the fact that after such a long time this game has not improved at all when it coms to dealing with these people.i would definitely NOT recommend you buying this game for the online open world aspect becouse of the huge amount of """"hackers"""" in this game."""
0;After Take Two posted that moding on GTA V is illeagal I and many others have lost interest in the game. This has made us feel that the freedom that they have given us for 10 years was just taken away. Just because Take Two wants more money they taken what GTA V means to me and others.
0;Eh Don't buy it if you don't want to deal with modders getting you banned and a cash grab company that's only caring about stealing your money. Rockstar time to do some boycott. EDIT and worse than that Rockstar perm banned me an hour after i got unbanned on the 20Th of January. i wasnt cheating or anything.
0;ing game I may have a good amount of time but it is just a grind fest to buy stuff and now since single player modding is gone it isn't worth the 60 it cost they should pay you now to take the game because of how it is rockstar kill your self you you and your piece of game
0;Rockstar have created an absolute jewel of a game which Take two has decided to all over removing the modding scene of singleplayer as we know it and this not okay. So it really quite simple if Take (the Two revoke their decision my vote will change until then we don't negotiate with terrorists.
0;THEY TERK ER MODS.On a serious note We must fight to the right to repair and modify our own property corporations try taking this away from us in order to make a quick buck. Whether it be Rockstar or Apple we must fight to the right to our own products. However it be they decide to make money off of they're anti consumer practices ie proprietary Electronics void warranties or microtransactions we cannot stand for this. If we can't do want we want with our property is it really our property?
0;Single player was fun but I really got this for GTA Online which as a huge disappointment. Endless grinding for cash annoying limitations and a hacker in nearly every session to ruin the fun. Rockstar got their money and has already moved on I suggest you do the same.
0;I am so SICK and tired of the ing 15 20 minute loading screens it drives me up a wall. We get frozen doing heists because of these loading screens and honestly it makes me HATE opening up gta v because theres no point. The heists are sometimes the best way to get money but NO ONE JOINS OR DOES THEM so its a waste. Most of the time people are too busy being jerks or begging modders to give them stuff so theres really no amazing point to playing this game /
0;You really thought the PC community would let this one slide Take Two?Look at my play time. I haven't spent a single hour in online mode that's purely single player with mods. Online isn't fun single player isn't fun. If it weren't for modding I would have forgotten about this game years ago.
0;This game has changed so much. ITs now just a microtransaction laden With the news that OpenIV team have been given a Cease &amp Desist order from Take Two Interactive and are no longer allowed to make the backbone of the best mods around I hope you all follow the rest of us and rate this down. you Rockstar and Take Two Interactive.
0;rubbish gamerockstar are foolsthey reset my character with no reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I didnt do anything I think it just happen to modders but never play rockstar games any longerthere are lots of other good gameshope other companys make similar game as gtaV
0;This was a decent single player experience but now I sorely regret purchasing as the publisher has started going after the modders. Mod support was previously one of the more compelling reasons to purchase this on PC. The multiplayer is an awful microtransaction ridden pit of meaningless chaos.
0;Terrible servers. Malicious modders still rampant. Anti modding policies. scripting. GTA4's AI was better by 5 by a whole generation.And the only time when cuckstar actually comes to do something it's only about the money. They did a shot in the dark and removed anyone's money that looked any at all suspicious. Including innocent players that had nothing to do with the modder money issue.game about greed ran by greedy people.
0;So rockstar is super awesome. I had a modded single player account and tried to hop online a few times 2 days ago. The game wasn't working so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. After 4 hours of it downloading I tried again to find out that my account was banned and all my stuff was gone for having mods IN SINGLEPLAYER. Good job rockstar
0;"""No extra content for singleplayer since launch. CheckSuper expensive online content under the name of """"free dlc"""". (I have seen less grindy korean mmos) CheckDo nothing about hackers at gta online for years. CheckDisable only tool that provides singleplayer content to the game. CheckThey just blame OpenIV for their lack of competence and lazyness."""
0;The past 4 major updates have all been rehashed from the same idea and are so expensive most players can't take part in them. The grinding is so bad worse than most MMOs. The game was actually fun back in 2015 when most of the content could be afforded after 1 or 2 heist runs.
0;Love the game but giving it a thumbs down for now. Afraid to play online for fear of getting banned for no reason which seems likely since most lobbies have modders.Update 6/17 Nothing I have seen from R* or the community has changed my view. If anything matters have gotten worse.
0;R* doesn't like that we the PCMR ''ruin'' the online ''experience'' by using for example FOV mod. Apparently it's an unfair advantage to have a substitute for the in built slider that doesn't change a thing. Nice 2 week ban and thanks Take Two for shutting down the ''dangerous'' mod project called GTA Multiplayer so you can earn more money from 12 year olds buying shark cards.
0;"""One of the best games I've played in my life but there are too many cheaters that are called as """"modder"""" and Rockstar is doing nothing. That's why I left the game months ago. Rockstar should be more strict while banning those people but I think they are not checking the people even. Same think happened also in the late times of Grand Theft Auto IV. Rockstar doesn't care about the game after 2 years of releasing time."""
0;"""They took away the only reason I had this game still installed.Since Take Two decided they were """"undermonetizing"""" their users and saw single player modding as a threat I'd recommend that nobody ever again purchases anything from them. Also remember their CEO basically said that the reason they didn't want to gouge us out of even more money wasn't because it was unethical but because we'd notice.Just in case remember Take Two also owns 2K and Firaxis."""
0;Honestly tired of the game. the loading times to play online are so bad I forget I have the game open some times. Not to mention the modders in the online environment always messing up the game by spawning players all over the place or spawning vehicals everywhere. What annoys me the most is when friends drop out of sessions or getting stuck on loading screens forcing them to close and reopen the game with these extremely long loading times.
0;Take Two seems to have all kinds of problems with modders who people support and who make the game more enjoyable but have zero issue and no qualms about jamming microtransactions down the throat of anyone who wants to actually enjoy their game. When I can't have fun in a $60 game without paying hundreds more for in game money so that the game is actually engaging there is a problem.
0;"""For shame Rockstar for shame. Shape up or no more cash for you I think.Take 2 have effectively banned moding in GTA V. Do not support them by buying their products.And if you really want to hit them where it hurts boycott Red Dead Redemption 2. RDR2 and possible hurt sales is probably the only reason the recent """"apology"""" by Rockstar was even released. Don't believe a word they say personally."""
0;As much as the game is fun I know people have been banned for being given money by hackers.Their anti cheat system is extremely unfair and aims itself at the wrong people.On a side note their recent event of shooting out a C&amp D shutting down OpenIV and multipleother fun mods is a complete let down.Companies lately have tried to show us that they know best and that the customer is wrong.I'm confident because we're proving that this isn't the case.
0;Back when I first bought this during the PS3 era I had great fun.Then I bought it again for the PS4 release it was still good (also I got to complete the story finally).Then the most important release the PC version. Finally we could mod the game!Well so much for that. Take Two has ruined whatever hope there was for this game to live past its expiration date.
0;"""Uninstalled this Game after 619h in game time for the following reasons OpenIV Prohibition Insanely high prices for MP content especially for someone who only plays MP casually Passive opposition against the creative/modding community No Singleplayer Updates/Support pretty much since day one The greedy f*cks from TakeTwo should rename their company to """"TakeAll"""" or """"Smaug's Cave"""""""
0;I just tryed to play online and it says that ive been banned until 2/7/17. really? for what? This is my first ban EVER and im instantly banned for a month with my character reset FOR NOTHING. I do not recomend this games online for its gltichy anti hacking software and its failure to ban real hackers. DO NOT FARM FOR MONEY it WILL result in a ban like me!
0;Rockstar and Take Two shoud be supportive of modders especially when they are only used for single player. Blocking many mods was bad enough but cease and desisting Open IV was the final straw and a total d**k move. I will no longer recommend this game or any other Take Two games.
0;Why kill OpenIV Mods for Singleplayer if the Problem are the numerous hackers in Online Mode? Online Play right now is a waiting in the lobby simulator while you try to hide from Godlike i will permanently get you banned hackers. Would still have given thumbs up for the amazing Singleplayer but banning mods ruined that too..
0;So it takes about an between 5 70 mins to load in whether its multiplayer or single. For only 400$ you can buy saints row 2! Now there's also an element of luck if you don't want to pay in that maybe you get a modder who is willing to lag your game out into unplayability by giving you tons of cash. Now thats a rare occurance. More often than not you're an unwilling barbie doll for a modder. To dress up burn and imprison as they please.
0;Take two A bunch of tw*ts that banned/Removed modding Not only for Online Which is understandable But also for Single player They then hope that by removing the key feature in single player that more players will go over to Multiplayer I would recommend the game about a month ago but now it just seems to have been F*cked over by Take two.Wouldnt recommend this game anymore.
0;Single player is alright but it's burdened by Rockstar Social Club.Online is a hot mess of corporate greed and hackers. You can spend loads of money and hours setting op thing like cargo sales only to have a hacker blow it up while spamming models on you to make the game crash causing you to lose everything. Rockstar's response? Don't cheat everybody now buy our shark cards.Don't bother.
0;"""Has both good and bad feeling toward this gameGood pretty fun game and nice DLCs Good for playing with your friendsBad Hackers are in every sessions They don't do anything much to hacker (That why there are more and more hackers) Hate speech on online sessionIt's a good game until you have hackers in the session and they try to show off their hacking """"skill""""."""
0;Singleplayer is alright Multiplayer is an open cesspool full of a cancerous community with a ridiculous grind that is not enjoyable in any way which gives you the option to spend hours getting enough money to buy a small minivan or just paying $100 and getting it straight away.
0;Rockstars Publisher Taketwo killed Singleplayer money just to force microtransactions on online players when hacking is still a legitimate problem. Also sets a horrible example as Taketwo has also just recently aquire Kerbel Space Program and owns other such games like XCOM.
0;Take Two seems hellbent on ruining any game they touch. The multiplayer is an expensive mess because they want you to buy game money with real money. The singleplayer lacks a lot of vehicles that are in the multiplayer so you cannot enjoy them without grinding for hours.And now the are getting rid of the modding scene ridiculous! Awful company.
0;If you plan on buying this to mess around in freemode dont bother as it is filled with modders with god mode and everything else under the sun making it pointless to even bother playing and considering that you are forced to play in public sessions to do anything with bunker MC stuff etc escaping to a invite only session is pointless
0;Since the latest update population on servers appear to have dropped. I am not loving the recent update personally.Because modders in the Online Sessions dropped cash on people prior to new update RockStar wiped clear many character accounts of not only cash given but cash earned or even purchased with SharkCards.The single player mode now greatly affected by the banning of Take Two. Cloud Sync Issues this morning gave me the time to write this review.
0;"""Single player was fun but when it's over you are left with a multiplayer experience which will turn you off the game completely. In order to enjoy multiplayer at all you must invest hundreds more of your own dollars through """"shark cards"""" due to rediculously expensive dlc products add that with a huge hacking community and you have a game that once was great but now I prefer taking that burn so much I'm left in tears."""
0;Ya know a fair game for the visually impaired but far from good. I need to be able to move the radar to the right and make notifications a LOT larger or easier to find in the menus for reading immediately. Due to all the people with mods it's just not a fun game at all now.
0;The OpenIV thing was honestly the last straw for me with this game. We are no longer allowed to modify our singleplayer game so it's actually fun to play while cheaters and modders are still rampant on the online servers. WTF? I now have a 60 game which is basically unplayable after completing the story with broken multiplayer milked to death by Rockstar and not being able to mod my SP for and giggles.
0;Online is crap Loading times are way too long Pay to win with Shark Cards Hard to earn lots of money on your own Not many people playing heists Toxic community Basically no anti cheatSingleplayer is bad No modding support Story is okay No support for the singleplayer (no DLC released) Content additions in multiplayer do not apply to singleplayer
0;Great game but for some reason got banned for 30 days and player reset. Played the game honestly and this is what you get. All the modders bragging about what they can get and to us normal players we get shafted. (Rockstar will fall by way of Ubisoft) will never purchase another game from/for them again. Don't waste ur time with this game!!!!!
0;Get ready to get banned when you start GTA OnlineThe game is infested with hackers and the way R* detects cheaters is hilarious.I have no mods or have tampered with the game in any way and still somehow get striked.You're first 2 strikes are temp bans and you're 3'rd is a perma. Not even having recordings will save your a $s3/5 The singleplayer is great.
0;I write this negative review in hope of take 2 interactive and the rockstar team will repeal the manhunt on the moders and other game breaking creators like the people behind OpenIV.And for those that are intrested in stocks here they are. http //www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ttwo/after hours
0;This microtransaction mindset has gone too far take two. I have bought this game three times and even though I have enjoyed it the ridiculous way you push your money grabbing to the point of whiping out the entire modding community is disgusting.I am uninstalling this after years of playing and I won't be buying another one of your products. You are what is wrong with this industry.
0;stupid immature cash grabbing from the company that owns it forcing players into multiplayer like cattle to a micro laden slaughter house. the single player is a great game save for the fact its shot in the back in order to encourage people to play the multiplayer.
0;"""Don't buy this game unless you only want to play story mode or play online by yourself in a private lobby. The first time I went into a public lobby my friends and I were killed repeatedly by modders. And if that wasn't enough later that day rockstar banned me for """"violating the EULA"""" when I had done no such thing. Plus when you contact support they say all bans are final. Don't waste your money on this game."""
0;I love this game but the developers treat the playerbase like They add new content every now and then but leave game breaking bugs in hopes that players buy their overpriced shark cards that no one gives a about. Honestly its easier to get a hacker to spawn in cash. Worst of all they recently removed online modding completely making the hard work of modders that try to make mods for others to enjoy unplayable while hackers still run rampant.
0;"""My experience with GTA online can be summed up in 3 steps 1. Work my off on heists to build up around 8 mil2. Log back on after the latest update ready to buy a cool new vehicle3. See that I only have $52 in my bank and nothing in pocketThanks for taking my """"illegitimate money"""" Rockstar!!"""
0;This game is just garbage now. It's pay to have fun as everything takes either days to grind out or you have to spend HUNDREDS OF REAL DOLLARS to ing do anything. Your game should not be that bad where you have to pay to do that. Online is full of modders and people who just KOS because why tf not.
0;Got banned for offline singleplayer mods ban not able to be appealed. I mean sure the upgrades as of late have been great but the absolute stupidity of the customer support and the outrageous pricing of things has turned the game sour.In the past 2 months that i was playing before being banned for no proper reason nearly every lobby i joined had modders giving other players money. Says a lot about the rockstar is pulling.6/10 but not worth reccomending.
0;Devs are scumsucking s who will release a game three times on a slow heroin drip so dumb ers like you will buy it more than once oh and they charge for in game currency because they're too ing lazy to do the work and add actual content. Don't support these money grubbing asshats buy mount and blade and mod the out of it instead
0;As of this moment I really can not reccomend this game and untill modders are sorted out i am not playing it again I just lost an entier shipment due to modders and that took weeks of grinding in and out of my work life unless rockstar compensate me with some in game $$$ i am not coming back to this game for a very long time!!!
0;I paid money for this game to play online with my friends yet am inclined to leave and join new lobbies every 20 minutes or so due to modders lagging the game by spawning in cars or whatever. Rockstar is too busy adding in Dixon and the Black Madonna to fix this major problem of modders so I don't reccomend the game to anybody at this time.
0;"""As for the actual game its great. I've had alot of fun... Online however is a very bumpy road. To be honest I would rather just have a bare bones multiplayer """"sandbox"""" where you could mess around with your friends and favorite mods. Other than that i find the limitations of GTA Online very restricting and therefore limiting the fun im having with friends"""
0;when i go to gta 5 online it is rare that i have the slightest of fun. mainly because of the people in the server so i go to another server and its the same thing. if you have no money you can't reallly do anything . and whos idea was it too add a mini gun to gta 5 online?
0;With Rockstar and Take Two recent decision to ban offline modding I cannot recommend this game. Rockstar and Take Two should embrace the modding community instead of treating them like garbage as modding is what keeps games alive and enjoyable well beyond their prime.
0;Take 2 Rockstar's parent company has essentially declared that modding is now illegal. They sent a cease and desist letter to the creators of OpenIV the backbone of single player modding in GTA V. The reason is they want to drive people away from singleplayer to multiplayer where players will buy microtransactions. I would definitely not recommend this game.
0;I will not stand for mods just suddenly not being allowed. It's part of what made this game so fun to play around with in a huge open world where the possibilities were almost endless. If they take that freedom away i will no longer support any of take twos games. my time will be much better spent playing Bethesda games which have allowed mods for years.
0;Take two wants to kill their game. Banning all MODs.Edit 7/7/2017 Open IV might be back which is good they heard us out. Well least Rockstar did. Rockstar was able to pressure or rather come to some senses with Take Two but Take Two in the way they worded things this could easily go back to how it was. I enjoy Rockstar and I'm glad they did the right thing. Though I can't support Take Two so I won't be changing this back to positive. Maybe one day Rockstar can branch away from Take Two.
0;Devs don't care about the players and are trying to get as much money as they can from the players. New update is worth 80 million which translates to around 600$ for the new dlc. They also offer no way of making money fast and then when they double payouts they take all the earned money away just so one of the players will buy a shark card.
0;The core mechanics are some of the best I've seen. Driving flying and shooting are all loads of fun in both the singleplayer and multiplayer.The downside is the multi player's economy is rigged to keep you running an incessant ratrace in an attempt to force the player into buying ingame $.
0;"""Got banned once for somebody else made a ticket response was a joke.Got banned a second time made a ticket same response as above.R* has a policy of not appealing bans or looking into what you provide them for proof.If you buy this game for online play just think about the fact that after 1 2 years they will just """"block"""" you and delete your whole progress."""
0;"""new """"shark cards"""" are disgustingly overpriced. R* is going to the dark side.. even players who get banned for hackers actions are 100% ignored by R* with no chance of appeal (and acc reset). the game is pretty good though if you can evade hackers and other bs lul"""
0;Not much to say I bought this game on pc solely for the amazing modding potential Now that Rockstar and 2K have nixed that the pc version is basically worthless in my eyes. I don't and never have given a rats about mulitiplayer. The 200+ hours on my record are just from messing around with various mods. I wish I could get a refund now.
0;I honestly just can't reccomend this game. It's such a shameless cashgrab and it's truely a shame to see that Rockstar one of my favorite (used to be) game developers has taken such a route. However you gotta hand it to them they do take us for the idiots that we indeed are.
0;Offline it's the best game of it's type. Online it's awful. I can't even get into the options to change anything without it crashing. That leads to at least five minutes of loading screens to get back into the game for it to crash again. it I give up on this
0;Becasue of the policies against OpenIV which is designed to force you into the garbage online so you may spend money I cannot recommend this game. The best part of this game on PC is the modding community and the worst part is the multiplayer. WIthout mods you are better off continuing to play on a next gen console if you already have it there.
0;GTA is a very fun game to play and love playing online with my friends as well as single player.However after the horrible update where you are no longer allowed to use mods even when playing with no one but YOURSELF. Your account will be banned to me this is unfair and a horrible horrible step made by the owner.I am giving this game a negative review solely because of this incredibly awful step.
0;I haven't seen this many hackers since I played unreal tournament 2004. The game is unplayable unless you do some uninteresting resource monitor shenanigans to escape the hackers who have full control of the game. Also said hackers can get you banned for their hacks. Can't care any less about the shark cards either buy them or don't. Last rockstar game I will buy.
0;It's not pay to win It's pay to have fun... When a game adds a sence of progression it's usually good but in this case you'll find yourself wanting to play all the new updates that have and relise you need millions to do that. To get 8 000 000 in game cash which will get you 'a few nice things or a big boat' you will need to pay $100 out of your own pocket! For a game that's about 2 years old on PC these prices are unreasonable. I can no longer recommend GTA V
0;Rockstar til ow me 1x Megalodon Shark card thet got lost... don't buy shark cards.. the problem i had for the last month was that I bought 2x Megalodon Shark card the same day and didn't get one.. now rockstar have sent me 8 000 000 gta$ our of 16 000 000GTA$..
0;DONT BUY THIS GAME! Its not fun its glitchy its a grind a pay to win and a lot of other issues. They keep adding little *heres a small amount of money that cant buy you anything* events so you keep playing but it wants you to pay more money to buy stupid vehicles to around in the multiplayer. honestly the single player is okay its okay NOT WORTH $60 THOUGH!
0;"""Rockstar anti cheat is awful and can't tell cheaters from non cheaters apparently as I was banned for no reason. This is why we need dedicated servers instead of this P2P crap. Rockstar has gone the cheapo route because their main concern is more $$$. Hundreds of negative reviews of people being banned for no reason. Think about it they can't all be lying. Think twice before buying this game for the multiplayer. At least there's FiveReborn.I will not be """"purchasing"""" anymore games from them."""
0;There are Free DLCs but you can't actually use them if you don't have ingame money. Funny how a frickin' car horn costs $75.000 and you earn a $20.000 from a heist setup. Heists are cancer with the online community anyways. Rockstar support doesn't give a rat's ... about you they just auto reply almost anything. This is actually much more evil then releasing a priced DLC. Not even gonna talk about OpenIV because that's a whole level of another story.
0;I didn't do anything No external plugins No modification of game data Did not do anything illegal I was banned from the GTAOL.Game is good no one can deny that. And it worth its price even just for the offline part great story! It would be wonderful if another company will run the online game because Rstar sucks at it.
0;singel playerpros.*it's perfect gamecons.*nothing i see yet....online game pros.*umm fun missions with alot of friendscons.*servers stability*lagg*lag g g ggg *someone shoots the civ standing next to me *bang* *bang* 1 sec after... BUSTEDand yeah...anti cheat systemdoes not existand the hackers... well they ... like thatbut if u play in closed friends session on online and will endure the lag... it will be awesome game for you and friends... D after my pc upgrade its rocks again
0;stan Man i am edsomeone whats wrong stanstan its the moders they give free money that i don t want in onlinesoemone them moders u see this counter strike and rocket leaguestan i gess ur right someone whos no oneSomeone yeahh need for speed don t forget that partstan thanks i think life as not chosen gta V as my favourite game for now...
0;I got permanently banned for no reason and the guys over at Rockstar dont care at all. It is sad that such a loved game from the past will end like this will all of us hating them. Thanks rockstar for wasting my time and 60 dollars. Get your straight.
0;I've been playing this game for 2 years. I finish the campaign and then go to the multiplayer but after playing the multiplayer for 1 year I get bored. They make updates but nothing new. I'ts the same thing over and over and it starting to get boring.I wouldn't recomand this game in 2018 because there are more multiplayer games that are more intresting.
0;Was a fun game now it just has toxic online community. Lack of real content ( single play exspanstion) is sad. Just because they make it free online content dosent mean its good. Story mode is great (but after you 100% there is literly nothing to do). But drive around and shoot people or mod cars. If you can pick it up super cheap do it. But dont bother with online its a JOKE!!
0;iest online multiplayer usability EVER. If I want to play a session with a friend who sits in another room I CANNOT DO IT since the f*ing developers dont bother adding server browsers to the game or any easy interface to join games together! And I can get old during the loading screens. Loading screens even when EXITING the session. WTF ROCKSTAR???
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEGood game at launch. Played it with all my heart until the last update from which point I keep getting banned for no apparent reason. I know Rockstar have up'd their game on ant cheat engines but also banning casual players isn't really an effective one. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ANYMORE! Unless you want to spend hours on writing emails to Rockstar Support to remove your bans.
0;Product received for free. I do love this game its my favorite BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE WORST GAME CUZ IT CANNOT PLAY OFFLINE MODE CUZ OF YOUR ACCOUNT THUS THE GAME SAYS THAT ROCKSTAR UPDATE SERVICE IN UNAVAILABLE LIKE U CAN HELP US CAN SUPPORT US EVEN SERVICES ARE ONLINE IS UNAVAILBALE I WOULD SAY I HATE YOU AND THE GAME FIX THIS STUPID ISSUE THANK YOUNOTE IF U DONT FIX THIS PEOPLE WILL HATE U CUZ U CANT HELP OUR PROBS OF THE GAME OK OK!!!!
0;You've probably already seen the same review about several hundered times so I'll keep it brief. GTA Online is trash for new players. If you want to buy this game buy it when its on sale and enjoy the single player campaign. If you really feel the itch to play a multiplayer GTA join one of the many GTA multiplayer communities and enjoy yourself. There's plenty to see and do in both of these choices not to mention the near unltimited content you can find from the modding community.
0;i really have not been a fan of this game recently. With the latest update It's near impossible to play the game on 8gb of ram. I actually ordered 16gb of ram just for this game. When I have to spend over 100 dollars to have a game run properly even though 8gb is reccommended that's when it's fixing time.
0;Decent singleplayer for what it's worth. Going online is a gamble. Whether you're dealing with modders who have nothing better to do griefers who want to pad their KDA morons who ruin your heists or just Rockstar themselves looking to ban you because Discord updated and re enabled its overlay which flags their system as a modder. Maybe wait until GTA 6 and hope for some major changes in support and leadership of the game. This one is just bad.
0;Used to be on my BEST GAME EVER list.Now filled up with terrorible gamers with either horrible skills or manner. Hard to enjoy. Trying hard to buy cool stuff by joining in millions of quests then get fuxked by cash players HEAD TO TOE. Basically no in game payment no joy.Less and less fun of cooperation . Salty and Heartbroken.I guess it's time for you and I to break up.
0;2017 After hearing about the news on the GTA forums and how the modding community has been treated. T2 the only reason GTA is as popular as it is isn't just down to the quality work Rockstar have put into the games but its also down to the players and what they do with them.I can't begin to describe how bad I feel about this situation. Back in 2015 I love this game because it's everything I wanted in a GTA title!The GTAO updates just keep on adding more and more stuff to do with friends online.
0;This a a good base game with great grapics but the servers are toasters that are slow and unstable. The online servers are also riddled with hackers as a result of one of the many hackers that i have encounter i have lost on average 800000 dollars in ammo in guns and other items. It is a impossible game with hackers every where and half of my hours being loading servers. over potental ruined. IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED
0;The online version of this game was made to milk your wallet! I would not recommend it to anyone it takes ages to make money and have fun. But story mode is great in my opinion! They should have made the online game easier at least for the money making part.
0;its a good game when playing single player but with the modders and everything thats ben going on with rock star i would not recoment it you will literally spend hours grinding and doing heist just to get into a lobby with a modder then you get banned and account gets reset witch is stupid the modder will literally freeze your character dump millions onto your character then instead of rockstar banning the modder they just ban you....
0;The game itself is fun but I haven't joined a single lobby online that didn't have a modder in it dropping planes on people or tripping you up with water. It was funny at first but after it keeps happening over and over and over and over it quickly stops being funny.
0;A great game being held down by greedy a holes from Take Two. Screw you for what you've done to OpenIVEDIT A few months after this sh*tstorm things have calmed down a bit. GTA Online is still ar*e tho.EDIT no. 2 You wanna buy this game? Do it for the story and so that you can play FiveM the multiplayer modification. Much better than Online.
0;I am uninstalling this game right now. I will keep it short. Hackers!!!You spend hours to make some money. One hacker shows up and destroys everything in seconds.Everyday and every session there is always hackers. The worst part is that GTA makers dont punish the hackers.It is a hacker paradise. I will never buy a rockstar game again.
0;I used to love this game so much back in January when the doomsday update came out. About 2 months later though i've been experiencing porblems with online where the game crashes after about 30 minutes of play.. This is a common thing amongst many gta players is there a way I can fix this? I really want to play the game and this bug is ruining everything. Probs 1/5 for now unless this gets fixed
0;2013 Oh hell yes new game was released. I hope there will be singleplayer DLCs.2014 No DLC for single player. Lets just wait. New gen versions release but still no single player.2015 PC version release but no DLCs for offline mode2016 CEO and Bikers? Im asking for single player DLC2017 Weaponized vehicles? No single player DLCs? come on Rockstar2018 Hotring Races and Clubs. No fruking single player DLCsNice fu king job Rockstar
0;This game is a waste of money i got banned for no reason and was banned permanantly because a modder spawned cash on me. I got a shark card and rockstar will not refund me this is horrible. It is fun to start off but afterwards the game becomes very boring because there is nothing to do and everything is overpriced.And now they have en got rid of single player mods YOU ROCKSTAR GAMES
0;man i heard gta v is an amazing gameand i think i got trolled this game is good with the single/offline modbut the online dont telling you this if your friends dont have gta v have fun having your time WASTED by inviting rendomslets just hope gta 6 wont be like this
0;As im not really into online multi with this game i love it but!! i really wish they would throw in updates for singleplayer its really annoying seeing all the content pushed into online.... for that i cant suggest buying it. i have over 2 100 hours into this game i would love to see some singleplayer content.
0;"""im so glad rockstar is the biggest piece of when it comes to banning. will get banned for supossed using mods but when some ing loner 40 y/o raging guzzler who has no freinds because he lives in his mothers basement kicking people out of games telling you """"HaVe FuN ReLoAdInG tHe GaMe"""" Really? you and your whole cancer community. shove a nice one right up the cant even make good new content. you and every developer who has ever worked on this game"""
0;GTA V is an amazing game very fun to play.The Online mode sucks.But you know what sucks even more?Take Two Interactive.Screw you you soulless corporate machine of c*cksuckers.You greedy little idiots who make thousands of hours of work literally vanish into nothing by c&amp d'ing OpenIV.Go f*ck yourself.
0;I cant play this game anymore cause whenever I try to play theres a Social Club intialization error code 1014 and I searched all of over the internet for the solution but there is none.And I have spent over $300 on this gam epreviously before this error occured.Such a waste...
0;fun to play good story but with a few exeptions of playing this game online still a lot of hackers online sessions wont always load or you get kicked out of them randomly long loading times which can take up to over 30 minutes if you're doing a heist.It's a fun game but these things make it very frustrating. Its defenetly not worth the full price so I'm glad I got it for only 20 bucks on sale.
0;Here's a realistic review of this game Story Mode is actually fun and feels greatOnline mode is a no go it'll be fun for a while but then said fun will be ruined by hackers and modders.Now to everyone asking if the game is worth 60$ for the offline mode...No it is not wait for it to be on sale.If you want details on the game i'll gladly add you as a friend to tell you more about the reasons you shouldn't buy this game at all.Finally for what you did to OpenIV i dare say Screw this game.
0;While the online continues to be plagued by hackers who ruin every single game with ridiculous exploits the Publisher considers single player mods to be a threat. Since the game release nothing has been done to stop online exploits.As is there is nothing of value in GTA V after the first story playthrough.The Online is a miserable wasteland of hackers playing against hackers.The Singleplayer is only good once without mod support.
0;Rockstar have just added more and more cars and motorbikes that allow for so much more griefing and it makes it unplayable I can't do any missions in the lobby because I'm being chased by a flying car that can fire rockets how am I suppose to do anything? The answer is pay rockstar and there you go now you can do what you want.
0;i got banned for a month on my online account and i have never done any exploiting modding or any cheating of any kind and not only that but my online characters and progress has been wiped Rockstar also does not care about customer support if i submit a ticket about my false ban then it is automatically disreguarded and i never get help it is also almost impossible to get any more support then that and im not the only one with this problem so rockstar can go die in a hole
0;While GTAV has been fun Rockstar has repeatedly treated their single player community horribly and this attack on mods is the last straw. Nobody should even bother touching this game until Take Two decides to stop trying to wring every little bit of money out of their customers with little to no effort on their part to actually improve the game.
0;filled with hackers online it takes forever to get anywhere without cheating and what was the point of doing the same missions for hours? you get a shiny thing after a week of grinding only for a cheater to go *click* and unlock everything on top of that. just cheat in the online and save yourself a lot of time.or just spend like a few thousand dollars to save yourself 1 2k hours of grinding money lol
0;So have had this game for ages on console and PC. Killing mods for the sake of money? Take Two honeslty how the hell do you claim to under monetize users when you EARN more then a 100% in a quaterly per annum. Like 60 bucks on a game purchase multiple times isn't enough? A game that becomes uselss after the endgame? A game whose online feature is a money pit and is trash for what it provides? Get a life honestly. Screw you guys.
0;"""The SOLO mode in this game is awesome. The ONLINE mode was okay until some modders forced TakeTwo to make a """"No Modding Policy"""" which is ridiculous and I will not stand for it. I'm leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team which is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE amount of mods for GTA."""
0;"""Welp been banned for using single player modding tools. Hell I think you don't care about your players/customers that much do you?So reat job Rockstar you let a automated servers take over your and you have no override command to unban anyone so great job you lost a huge amount of customers for pulling a move like that. For anyone thinking about buying this game don't because if you get bored of it in single player and want to add in a little """"extra"""" watch out."""
0;If you like a game where after 3 years of playing fairly you get banned (along with several other innocent players even though they unbanned you after) then go ahead and buy the game. Game runs on high priced DLC with no attention to community or its feedback. NOT RECOMMENDED.
0;Hello yesterday Rockstar Studios sent an e mail saying that for some reason my GTA5 Online model had been blocked for 30 days.This account ensures that there is no cheating or misconduct.Ask customer service or Rockstar studios to identify the cause check the account and check if it was missealedGive me an answer as soon as possible.Thank you!
0;"Optimization is joke Hitreg is incosistent ""CHINA NAMBA WAN"" So many updates and I still get gamebraking glitches Game is full of cheaters You can get STDS straight from public chat +You can learn chinese in no time even on EU/NA servers+Fun for people with wallhacks+If you like downloading 26mb anticheat updates every 10minutes"
0;Rockstar has turned this game into 80% wait on loading screens or grind to 20% play. Do not recommend and I hope the next Red Dead Redemption does not follow this path because we acctually like that francise.AAA games in general have been really this past couple years.
0;The multiplayer experience is fun with friends but when you get transferred to a public lobby with modders... THAT however isn't fun. Got perm banned on both of my accounts because rockstar can't fix their anti cheat measures And support was REALLY helpfull by telling me that my account was permanently banned and couldn't do anything about.Spend your $60 on something else )
0;Messing with the community was a terrible decision Take Two. Do you really think that killing the mod tools would stop cheaters? Well you're wrong. They always find a way. We the legit players that only want to enjoy a fun single player experience are the ones affected by your decision. RIP OpenIV.
0;I used to like GTA5. But as time has gone on the singleplayer has stagnated due to a lack of DLC and the multiplayer has become a hacker infested hell hole. Not only this but everything in the multiplayer has been made just for micro transactions. Want that new rocket car that actually looks like fun well better buy over $10m of in game cash. You cant even get these cars in the singleplayer which is utterly ridiculous.
0;17/10/2018Every lobby has griefers/modders ranging from the subtle speeders/flame throwers (whilst they are sitting in a vehicle passively or half way across the map) to the extreme where they spawn an infinite stream of jumb jets on you that push you under the world and eventually memory leak your computer going beyond ruining your game but also locking up your computer or worse.Stay away from this expensive mess it's a childs sandbox for idiots.
0;Mo more modding really? Way to off your fan base. I hate online with passion mods made my single player experience 1000x better. You contribute to story and now you are going after mods? off! This is the last product I will purchase from your hole. Take Two and Rockstar are on my list from now on.Peace among worlds i!i
0;Get this game on a console. Not worth paying full price on PC unless you want to get your account suspended for no reason at all. Just because you're in a lobby with some other hacker. Plus the first offence is a complete reset of your characters that you spent so much time on and a 30 day suspension. It's too harsh. So not worth it unless you only want to play single player. Otherwise a great game ruined by their strict anticheat checks which bans you for no reason at all.
0;If you aren't great at or don't want to farm heists be prepared to spend massive amounts of money in 'shark cards' for cars.A single car can range up to an equivilent of about $75.00. And there are multiple vehicles at that price. You could easily spend over $1000 to get all the top vehicles.The game is fun yes but the grind isn't very easy to burn out.
0;Good game but an atrocious DLC model which incentivises microtransactions to keep up along with a horrible stance on modding makes your purchase supportive of the kind of publisher that makes these kinds of things okay.Don't buy it. They don't deserve your money.
0;Disabling mods? Seriously Rockstar? Your games have replayability BECAUSE OF THOSE MODS! GTA franchise is the most modded and moddable franchise. And you shut that project down? You shot yourselves in the leg fellas you'll understand that sooner or later.
0;Game is great fun only problem is micro transaction hell and they ruined mods by taking down an essential mod that allowed other mods to work. Modding is a huge selling point in the game and is the reason many people play it and just because the devs aren't making money on shark cards they decide to ruin single player so they go to multiplayer. It's ridiculous the game is one of the most profitable of all time then they randomly pull this This needs to be fixed...
0;Take two would like you to stop modding the single player portion of the game and go spend 90 for a single car in their unpunished cheater filled online modeSo they made modding their game illegalI will never be buying another product from take two interactive or rockstar games again
0;Get it for the Single Player not the toxic Online. Online can have loading screens easily exceeding 20 minutes on the regular. Not just for initial boot but when missions end. Everything is expensive you're better off just buying a modded account to get what you want. A lot of it is a worthless grind.
0;i have been addicted to this game for over a year and a half now. but after the new gunrunning dlc came out all of my (legit) cash was taken from my account. i just got cash from a modeder who felt sorry for me today and after buying 1 thing in the ingame website's it wont let me use my bank anymore. sad 2 say this but gta is dead and this is the update that killed it.
0;"""Do not buy if you're expecting a """"free mode multiplayer"""" the online mode in this game is just another career mode and if you do try to play with other people or just meet new people they'll just think you're going to kill them so they kill you first it's a ing shambles also single player gets absolutely no attention clearly this game is made for online mode to make money and that's it"""
0;Unless you're willing to swipe your credit card with each update be prepared to spend a few hundred hours grinding for paltry sums of ingame currency to purchase vehicles that ultimately are outclassed by the next update.Otherwise the single player is pretty neat.
0;"""This game was good then rockstar saw how much people like the online feature. And now every GTA after this is going to be nothing but a cash Grab as in """"here are some real fancy and cool idea for $100 + irl. GTA is a good game but owned and made by a greedy company."""
0;A ton of hackers. the company doesnt care really about hackers. 100% you will find one or more hackers on any server you go to. You can play in a pvt group. but if you want the big bucks you gota play on public servers where hackers are. other then that its just redneck rampageOH! if you do have a hacker on the server you are on YOU can get banned for what he is doing while he gets off scot free. beware before you play or buy
0;They banned me for cheating.... i never cheated.. i wrote to them about it they just said its prema and they will not lift it nor talk about it... i miss playing the game with my friends best online game i have played wish i could get my account back and my progess... (
0;Oh hello there you're about to buy this game and spend more money and waste your life on it? well today is the day where i tell you do not purchase because you will be banned if you play fair. save your money today. I'm dissapointed i played this game since day 1 transfered from an old console to PC and then i get told i wasted my time and i get everything wiped. Dissapointed in you rockstar.
0;Pros Blow stuff up Good storyCons Buying shark cards isnt really optional Rockstar customer service try to make money on events but then Rockstar steals it and calls it 'illegitimate' Multiplayer is heavily militarized and requires friends to enjoy it Lots of hackers Its possible to get perma banned when a hacker drops money on youHonestly though i did get my moneys worth out of it before being banned even if i spent most of that time complaining
0;Grinding for way too expensive items and wasting ur life isn't much fun when there are so many people that have reached the top and once reaching the top there is nothing left except pvp and griefing OR MORE GRINDING FOR ANOTHER UPDATE0/10 worst Military attacking poor people trying to make money simulator
0;Hackers... hackers everywhere.GTA Online is just simply doomed. In every lobby there is at least on hacker/modder call them what you want. They are almost unstoppable now. And what R* does is a joke... or even worse than that. If you want to buy this game for the online experience just DON'T. The console version is much more clean. (PS4 and XBOX ONE)
0;After banning OPENIV I really don't see why you would buy this game anymore.We as gamers have to take a stance and stop spending money on Rockstar / Take Two until the issue with singleplayer mods is resolved. After so many years of allowing modding of GTA games it really is a d*ck move to ban mods in this game.As a community I hope we can achieve something by giving low scores and bad reviews for this game.
0;Eat my Take Two. The only reason I bought this on PC was to mod it. This will not solve your online hacker problem so again eat my .. They even patched gta4 for the first time in 7 ING years So people have trouble modding that too. eat my you greedy ing kunts
0;This is on the behalf of the OpenIV team. OpenIV doesnt allow ANY online compatiblilty. If you were to attempt to go into GTA5 Online with your OpenIV's changed files it would revert you back to single player! There's no reason for this to happen! https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;I had to go back to GTA V on ps4 because of all the hackers. I have always played legit and the fear of getting banned from ppl that hack and mod is just nuts. I have to make clear i have not been banned but reading people that have for no reason makes me just play it safe and play on ps4.
0;The game is fun and all but the servers are you get disconnected half the time when trying to play with friends. Also its pay to win the economy is balanced very unrealistic and thrives on corporate greed. Heists only pay 300k max when a luxury car is like 1.5m. There are starving children in Africa and rockstar is charging $99.99 for a virtual yacht. Gameplay is fun but the pay to win economy is literal aids
0;Great singleplayer campaign worst online community ever. matchmaking no filtering by player level hackers everywhere toxic community. Online sucks period.Buy it if it's on sale like I did but only if you've never played the singleplayer campaign. DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE FEATURE. You WILL regret it.
0;won't let us mod the game off line just so they can sell more shark cards just because a few hackers were giving free money same reason they stopped the gta stock market because it was making people rich and we can't have that as rich people dont need shark cards.greed company this game is 5 years old and is still at full price will never buy another rock star/take 2 game again.
0;So I recieved this as a gift during the 50% off sale. Less than 12 hours into my gameplay and I get a 30 day suspension. The only character I had I played with friends only. No mods no cheats. She only had 50k in the bank one 2 car garage and the free car available ingame. Bang gone. Glad it was half price.
0;On behalf of all modders who spent hours upon hours of their free time improving and fixing your game for free...On behalf of all your paying customers who have been robbed of a way to still enjoy the game years after its release...On behalf of everyone who's going to get ed over in the future by the precedent you've set this day...Update 2017 cant even load game after not playing for some time as usual STUPIC SOCIAL CLUB ISSUES!!! THIS IS GARBAGE FOR THE MONEY WE HAVE PAID FOR!!!!
0;If you want this for singleplayer only go ahead.Multiplayer is a mess. Hackers and connectivity issues abound. at least one hacker in every server blatantly discussing hacking methods and how not to get caught in global chat. Asking other players to report a hacker was met with threat of banning BY the hacker. I have no doubt it was possible after reading other reviews.STAY AWAY until something is done.
0;The solo mode is great and worth playing but the online became more and more trash as years came by Pay to win the richer you are the better your arsenal is. Full of microtransactions and outrageous prices for e v e r y t h i n g. Cheaters and modders everywhere! Awesome! Cancerous community.
0;Game has gone down hill since its first released in 2013.. It's pretty much just a battle royale in any public lobby you get.. The game has turned in to a grind for money much worse than it was at release. New cars that have nothing really new to give and cost way too much for the stats. Game is riddled with modders killing you with hydrants and fires spawning on you. Just steer clear of this game it is not worth the hassle and struggle to get anywhere in this game.
0;This company Rockstar just falsely banned a multitude of accounts for 30 days and deleting all progress of those accounts. Given that Rockstar Support is completely ignoring this matter. The best way to attract their attention is to dump a bad review on steam. Here's mine Rockstar. Enjoy your bad rep.
0;Online is funny but there is so many things that i just hate for bottom of my heart. First Loading times are just epic... Second daily missions are mostly fun to play until there comes capture or something where you need to get some other players to play with. You are unable to complete daily if you cant get any player to join and play the mission with you. So i had enough to day i dont care and i wont play it anymore.
0;very good singleplayervery good onlinefree online dlc since release in 2013but the developers are too greedy and if you don't cheat or spend all of your money on shark cards then you're gonna have to grind 24/7 to get anywherebad anti cheat75% of all sessions there is atleast 1 cheater
0;You go and have massive ban waves on this game remove all of my items and money even when modders are at fault so I said screw multiplayer ill just have fun with crazy singleplayer mods (tsunami being my favorite) and now you remove those because of your precious profit margins that arent even affected. What happened to you rockstar you used to be cool.
0;Haven't played in forever. Try to log in and the captcha is infinite and doesn't let me reset my password. When I finally ask to send it to my email. I never got an email. I've spent lots of time and money in this game. I highly recommend no one buys this POS game where the support won't even answer emails.
0;I was playing this game with my friend and there was a modder than 10 min later there is 100 modders in the lobby and you get money droped on you. Then Rockstar games desides to give you a had that makes fun of you when you get banned. Me and the hole lobby was banned and gaven (Dunce Hats) that makes your player look stupid. DONT BUY THIS GAME. Buy red dead 2!!!!!!!! Thanks Rockstar for 60$ down the drain!!!!!!!
0;Seriously Rockstar? Fix this. It is nothing but pre pubescent children loading up scripts and griefing everyone on the map. This game isn't even worth owning and I definately wouldn't have brought it on PC if I knew this was going to be such a significant issue.
0;payed over 260 howers just to be banned for absolutely no reason it's ridiculous because my account was reset as well doing absolutely nothing what are they think they are godas well as their support team is not very handy they just said they couldn't do anything about it
0;This game is a grind. If you like grinds more power to you. I have 700+ hours in this game 600 of which I regret so much. I'd avoid this game but I do hate to say that you missed out. There is really nothing left for this game progressing as a beginner is becoming more and more difficult by the day to the point where I'd say it's not worth it anymore.
0;It has potential. It's a good game graphics are great well optimized story is long and imersive. They just had to ruin it didnt they?The game is a massive grind. You have to play hours upon hours to get stuff and it wasnt a problem until recently. Shark cards are ridiculously expensive and the vehicles are getting more and more expensive.
0;Awfull developers. How can you ban someone innocent for 30 days after just playing the game for a few hours? The worst part is not admiting to your mistake Rockstar! Not going to play this game again unless they come forward with apologies and fix the situation.
0;At first it was a great game but the lack of mods and the frequent problems that I have performance wise in this game and connection wise had me reconsider my opinion on the game very heavily as of recent. The over reliance on microtransactions to advance in the online mode and the lack of updates in the singleplayer mode despite the length of time since it's initial release have heavily reduced my enjoyment of the game. I would have given this a positive review before but not so much anymore.
0;loading is very slow when connecting to internet even with 100mbs and good hardware. other then that it is very fun. but ive had problems connecting through out the couple years that i have owned it. the servers are complete s***. Rockstar doesnt care about fixing them. dont buy the game its not worth waiting for the servers to connect
0;Bought this game for the single player and thought it was okay I tried multiplayer once and it was an awful grind unless you submitted to the microtransaction Gods... But the modding ability and community made it a fantastic single player game until Take Two Interactive decided that actually they didn't like that so made OpenIV stop by sending a cease and desist effectively gutting a huge portion of the modding scene.I would no longer recommend this game to someone...
0;Played GTA since the late 90's. Bought every one. Have this for 360 XBone and PC. Its been sliding downhill for me with the ADHD level of DLCs but the final nail in the coffin is Take 2s recent attitude to mods. Remember when you bought something and it was yours? Remember when companies had to repsect their customers to maintain them?I wont buy another Take 2 game.
0;So first you make the multiplayer next to unplayable on public servers due to rampant hacking and then you take the fun out of singleplayer by essentially banning mods? off! The OpenIV devs did their best to prevent their tool from being abused you reward it by a freaking cease and desist!
0;the only problem in this game is too much modder and hacker legit i was playing the adversry mode occupy and a guy spawn a UFO as a shield. CAnt do anything about it. if this keeps up i might just be a hacker better than being a player plz get your act togahter and check the player action more frequently plz i love this game but this is not acceptable.
0;The F is wrong with this game? I can't host any Heist Lester didn't call me for the First Heist!I spend so much money just to buy the latest High End appartemen and this is what i got? can't host Heist at all?Great i'm just wasting my money and time just for this.
0;Best to just not even look at this game it takes to long to get cash 4 or 5 days stright of doing jobs you hardly get anything to show for it the online comunity for the game is cancer and rockstar dosent know how to do anything even set up a proper anticheat chances are within your first few days online youll be shot every 5 seconds run over blown up repeatedly by a hacker or something else the game is just all around bad at this point its a wast of 60+ gigs.
0;I never even modded the game but taking the fun away from people who mod who aren't ruining the fun of others simply to push them into multiplayer to shove microtransactions down their throat is super s h i t t y. That's about the quality of this game now. Don't buy it move on put your money towards something worth your time like the Witcher 3.
0;I''ve been playing for a few months and I've put up with ALOT of issues like the game timing out when transitioning from missions back to the main online game hackers running around with impunity and failed money transactions. It can be fun but ultimately this game is flawed and I would not recommend this game for purchase if you are interested in playing online.
0;Hackers have been ruining the multiplayer and just when I think Rockstar is going to come in and take care of it they do this. Rockstar Games and their publisher Take Two Interactive have sent out a cease and desist to the OpenIV team a group of independent developers who have kept the single player mode of GTA thriving years after the release fixing all the failings of Rockstar in the process. you Rockstar. you Take Two.
0;Although I don't mod personally I can see why people do. It creates a fun community of custom content. Because people are using these mods on single player and not buying godforsaken shark cards Take Jew interactive has decided that they can make more money by making modding illegal literally illegal.We have to stand up to this.
0;Changed price during summer sale to make 30% off equal 60 dollarsYea it includes some stupid in game money but the base product is still full price....................../ /) .................... / ../ .................../..../ ............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...') ......... .................'...../ ..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............( .............. ............. ...
0;Got a bunch of money by joining a modded lobby now every time I log on Rockstar 'adjusts' my cash. It's pretty frustrating knowing that I'm grinding out missions for money and may not even keep any of it. Rockstar doesn't seem to want to punish all of the players using god mode or other hacks that actually affect players negatively just people who received some cash because they're too cheap to implement any kind of anti hacking checks.
0;Open IV ruined the modding scene but Rockstar have been milking this game for years with shark cards been a dead game for ages now without money online is essentially pointless and you get banned over getting modded money due to them crying over you not spending 50 plus on shark cards.
0;Well I got banned cause one ing guy started dropping me money!! What should I do if that happened to me? Of course i instantly logged out but no I still got a ing ban for THREE MONTHS for nothing. I had level 145 some cool cars and a pretty house and now everything is gone. I dont see any point doing all these boring heists and working for 100k$/30min when these money are kinda worthless. I'm done with this game...
0;Great game...for the first few days then R* thought it would be a great idea to ban any cheat whether it is a graphical mod or not or if it is single player or online. IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET BANNED TORRENT THE GAME! I'm sorry but really i mean mods are half of the GTA experience.
0;I played this game for the first time on 4/13/15 at 9 36 PM and had the best time of my life. 5 days later I downloaded my first mod for it and it fixed some graphical issues. And recently I was banned for 15 days in a ban raid? R* the game needs mods to survive on PC. And I will not be recommending it to anyone until the mods are allowed. 10/10 &gt 0/10
0;After playing the solo game which was meh compared to earlier adaptions i tried the online play. THe community was so sad i literraly cried for 3 weeks straight and started going to church every sundaymorning which I still do. All in all the game sucks balls. After completing the ing game i finally got some millions (believe me its easier in real life... haha no its not) the only thing left to do was completely zero zilch. nada.
0;Too many HACKERS and nothing you can do about it.they can spam you with false transactions were you need the restart your game to fix it. teleport you anywhere at any time. kill you instantlly. remove your hard earnd cash (or paid with REAL money). remove your ammo. cause an errror where you will be kick to singleplayer.not a game worth playing
0;I would love to give this game a great review. Because come on its Grand Theft Auto 5 and it runs great on PC. But Rockstar is making it more and more difficult to mod. One of the main reasons I'm a PC gamer. I could do without multiplayer personally and the overpriced cash cards for the ability to mod.
0;Still a hacker infested game. Not that enjoyable anymore. items are overpriced and make the game too much a of a grind. Which is why people beg for money from modders. It shouldn't be that way All items should be obtainable by casual players with out grinding.
0;are they smoking crack? they are still trying to charge full price for this game? plus the freaking paywalls? and no dlc for the single player in like 4 years? bad form rockstar bad form i've always been a fan of your games because they are quality products but this is getting rediculous
0;Takes WAY to long to gind for money to buy anything cool. They also don't add everything multiplayer has into single player. I just wanna around with my friends with all options available Not grind over 100 hours with minimal enjoyment befor the game gets fun.
0;I was just ripped off by rock star today over 500.000 dollars on a car tha they said was free but then chargede me for thatamount. when trying to sell worthles car back they show no value. I have been a member since 2015 'Ripping off their customes seems to be their way of getting all of the money from us.They also will not let sell anything back after you spend millions in the game..l
0;DO NOT BUY THIS.Whilst playing online a hacker managed TO LOG INTO MY ACCOUNT FROM JUST BEING IN THE SAME SERVER. Also my friend was banned after a modder level him up a few hundred levels without his consent and rockstar still banned him. Rockstar is a piece of sh*t company that doesn't care about its game or its users anymore.
0;So playing through Heists to get money instead of modding it in being the good little person that I am just so that the heist finale that we were doing decides to not give anyone of us any sort of cash. Thanks Rockstar I totally am not going bankrupt because I spent my entire afternoon doing Heists and what do I get? Nothing! I can't even access that heist's finale again thanks to me having a new heist to setup. See this is what makes people mod the game to give themselves billions of dollars.
0;Great game good graphics and fun gameplay! BUT if you were holding off from getting the game and waiting to get the pc version because of mods DONT as rockstar has recently changed the EULA you can now get BANNED from modding the game. This is completely asinine Rockstar great job and go yourselves.
0;Loading Simulator 2013.I cannot belive that his game has not improved it's HORRIBLE loading screens The game is absolutly fantanstic BUT and there's a big BUT The insanly big loading is not worth a single dollar of this game by any means Thanks for upvote
0;So I was selling bunker stock alone and once I finished the sell an error message appeared saying that the game couldn't complete the transaction or something like that and I didn't get the money. This happened to me twice and I still didn't get the money for the sell back. Even though it wasn't a lot it's really annoying cuz I spent money and time to get that stock.It felt like rockstar stole from me directly
0;Game had a great single player game! The time it took to come to PC was long but the game is very well optomized and is awesome. I would recommend the game for single player only. Online which Rockstar has put all their time/money into after the release is a mess. It also caused Take Two/Rockstar to prevent any modding capabilities since they could make their way into their online mode.
0;"""I'm glad I have a second account to talk about this game. Screw Take Two for this nonsense they pulled with mods deeming them """"illegal"""" in a single player sense. I bought this game on PC *for* the mods. I own 4 copies of the game and for what? Typical cooperations blinded by the wall of money.Don't get this game or any Take Two game if you're looking to mod. Don't even give them a dime if you're *not* modding."""
0;1. rockstar focused on ing sharkcards too much2. WHERE IS THE MOTHER IN SINGLEPLAYER DLC THAT TELL THE STORY OF CJ3. to many unworthy dlc4. SHARKCARDS AGAIN ITS T MAN5. OpenIV got banned so no mod for you6. no more character transfer7. to many promises... just like my girl
0;"""This game is ridiculous the new plane """"The Bombushka"""" costs 70 ish great british pounds for a in game item thats why people go to modding and get there accounts banned and then they have to buy another account because GTA is a fun game so thats another 20 40 depending on where you buy from.Sooooo this game is trash and Rockstar is raking it in."""
0;Just want it to be known my first every GTA online experiance was with a hacker giving me cash. Only time I can say I was glad to see a hacker. But that was my initial reaction to GTA online and since then I've seen countless.Only got the PC version to get some of the awesome singleplayer mods. Shame. I'd refund this if I could. Don't buy this if you intend to mod it you'll become a criminal P
0;This game is great fun Until you start trying to enjoy yourself in freemode using the cars and planes you have bought which you earned through grinding heist after heist...... To be constantly killed by teleporting modders cheats that are immune to damage and kill you instantly... DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THE MULTIPLAYER ASPECT! AVOID
0;After spending over 2 000 hours on this game and grinding millions of dollars for the next update Rockstar took away most of it and left me broke. I would be happy if they took away the unwanted $1 000 000 dollars that were modded but they took away an additional $11 000 000 that was legit and earned through playing the game. Don't get this game until they fix this issue with online that many people are having.
0;"""Hackers Rule the world. And not only that if you make too much money legit. Rockstar will take your cash with no explaination. Had a friend have his CRIMINAL MASTERMIND money taken from him.. over 14 million total... within minutes of finally completing the Mastermind finale. Essentially 200$ worth of Shark cards. *They have no idea how to solve the hacker problem so they delete """"suspiscious"""" money which jsut means.. if you're good at the game. you're going to be robbed by Rockstar*"""
0;This is the last GTA title I buy. I havent logged online in months on this title and Im normally on closed sessions when I play. My hard earned $ is apparently only there for later removal by an anti cheat program. Honestly Im willing to bet this was intentional those corporate hacks assume profits in the midst of this little mess like war lords gun running in 3rd world countries. Worse than EA.
0;Strange business practices and nonsensical choices have damaged this game.Targeting the Singleplayer mods as they can be ported to Multiplayer has really shown that all they really care about is the microtransactions as they don't want people hacking in money. Thier solution to ban the biggest Mod is a horrible idea.
0;simple story i play GTA online then after few min i see i kill all player in one time and all player call me hacker. do you think this funny rockstar? FUNNY? i never use any cheat or hack. we are customer. we buy your game. without customer you are nothing. yup this is awsome game but please fix your game!. i hope i never got banned.
0;i was banned once before because of a modder. a few months after i was unbanned i started playing again. in less than 1.8 hours i was permanantly banned. i didnt do anything nor will rockstar acknowledge me when i submit a ticket to be unbanned. they just give the same generic response each time all i ask when i post a ticket is why i was banned not if i can be unbanned.
0;Rockstar just commited corporate suicide let's put it this way games are the state mods the currency and rockstar the goverment well they went full communist on their policies and banned all mods so everyone has the same level of enjoyment. them commies. you take our liberty and resources away and we take your money.
0;"""If they maybe fixed the loading times or stopped people from """"Modding"""" in online multiplayer then maybe it would be worth playing. These """"modders"""" or hackers ruin the online experience but to me it seems like the amount of them have only slowly increased since the release of the game. Why is the modding community being targeted when their GTA Online environment is so flawed."""
0;If i could only play one game for the rest of my life this would be it! The best game I've ever played There is so much freedom in online mode You can do anything. One of the things I love the most is being able to customize almost every vehicle and get to become a billionaire. As well as roleplaying. With no doubt this is my favorite game )Edit I got banned for cheating in online this game
0;Online is still heavily populated with modders particularily the ones who enjoy making the entire lobbie's guns disappear. It's fun when no one has any idea who did it and the report function threatens disciplinary action against the reporter. Buy any other title and let this one die.
0;It's fun for a few hours but recent updates destroyed the online mode even more. Rockstar tries to make this game into everything that's popular but that backfired quite hard with the latest DLCs. Gunrunning was a cool idea but not well thought through.The Singleplayer on the other hand is pretty much perfect. If you don't care about the Online which I did though. Then this is an instant buy.
0;Banned for no reason.I don't understand. I didn't do anything. I just Task on normal. Was banned for no reason at all.I did not violate the ban. Also did not use or abuse the game mechanism or interfere with other player's gaming experience. I want to know what I've done.I was forbidden to log in.I have always followed the rules of the game.I want to know why.
0;Game crashes i cant get my shark card bundle i buy a shark care and it still doesnt work 3 days out. This game is great but the support sucks While writing this my game crashed again. Oh how fun it is spending 60 dollars and not being able to run your game on a bad computer.
0;Overrated game the thing is the singleplayers is fine but after the whole fiasco with take two wanting to ban mods I don't know..... ...also gta online is just a microtransaction money farm (and heck is it boring). Have not opened this game for half a year and finally completely uninstalled it.
0;one of the best things i loved about GTAV is the ability to mod offline. after hearing that Rockstar will be removing the ability to mod offline. in my opinion that was the best feature of this game. IDK why Rockstar decided to remove the ability to mod.
0;you Take Two ! They just banned moding for this game. That means single player is boring and pale. And Online mode is anyway becouse there is no DEDICATED servers only some stupid lobby system where you spent more time on loading screens than actually playing a game. Not worth buying. Lets hit them where it hurts..in a pocket.
0;After the news of Take Two Interactive issuing Open IV a cease and desist order I can no longer reccommend this game or its developers due to their despicable actions towards the single player and modding communitites. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Open IV just give it a google and it won't take you long to see just how essential it has been to the modding community for almost 10 years. Screw you Take Two. Screw you.
0;Bought the game for my alt because this account got perm banned for no reason 2 hours in my alt account gets perm banned! So far i have called rockstar support waited in a 30 min queue. Wanted to commit suicide when the representive told me the policy they have of no BAN APPEALS NO MATTER WHAT AT ALL! GG Wasted $60 dollars on another game to earn 200k and get banned GG ROCKSTAR GG. You Thieves
0;I'm not recomended this game because this what Rockstar doing with multiplayer is bad. I liked Single Player and I hate Multiplayer because multiplayer is going like Saints Row with steroids + have cheater who giving moneys and when give You moneys then You probably get baned /.I change my review when Rockstar give options to not install wasting space multiplayer crap!!
0;Rockstar support about randomly happening bans we don't care.This will happen to you.Anything will get considered as a side cheating program.Online real cheaters will eventually shower you with money and you will get banned for it.You will plea but they won't careTake your cheated money away (well i'm okay with this obviously)And when your ban is gone you will log in .. and get banned again because reasons.F* these people.
0;if you get banned on gta v rockstar are at answering questions about why like i got temp banned for greafing so a normal monday go on to gta v online load in go to garage and bang before i get to open the elevator doors i get temp banned for grefing when i call rockstar i get told they cant do anything for me so my advice dont talk or play with hackers as they will get you banned #PC MASTERACE PROBLEMS
0;I've always loved grand theft auto. I've had no problem with this game until I uninstalled it. It will not download again and I'm furious. Rockstars support sucks&gt so does steam. I wish I could talk to someone 1 on 1 but no...Do not get this game. If you want to go ahead. I do not recommend it.
0;Crap servers. I end up loading for a really long time which is really annoying. Apart from the server stuff the game's really good and fun to play with pals. Recommended for a fun time with friends but I've down voted this game due to the poor servers.
0;Just leave this game to wither and die. It's been impossible to play in Australia for so long and the developers don't give a . This game had a lot of potenial and is still fun to play but the chances of whether you'll be able to actually play a clean unbugged match is a coinflip (well more like a 20% chance). Don't buy this game. Let the devlopers get thier together or shutdown ( and I kinda hope they shutdown).
0;"""Now first off This game was great to play on the PC. It was well optimised had good graphics and was fun to play.But a game published by a company that tries to exploit their players by claiming it's """"on sale"""" by making it more expensive should not even be rated above 50%.*rage intensifies* you Rockstar I used to like this game.Please make this the worst rated game on Steam.**Yes even worse than Airport Simulator*rage ceases*"""

0;GTA V The biggest sh*t i have ever played on ps4 now i made a mistake and bought it for second time got banned for 100K modded money. Rockstar support full of bots no one can help you. Character transfers removed so i lost my 1000+ hours of playtime on my ps4 rank 296 and bought 2 shark cards. Guess what rockstar dont give a . I hope that was helpful review don't get this game if you mind to transfer from console.
0;Meh MP is boring you can't have fun without having millions of dollars which most people modded into the game anyways. The game favors high level rich modders because they have auto lock on vehicles and powerful guns yet you're stuck with a crappy sniper rifle that takes like 4 shots to kill (both cause it sucks and leveling gives you more health) meanwhile they shoot you once and you're down.If you've come for fun with friends play gamemodes and stick with em if you're playing solo. Don't.
0;Marketing juggernaut GTA V is too big to fail and has a horde of children online to squash any criticism too.Well optimized singleplayer looks great and no doubt the PC version is the best version (BEHOLD OBVIOUS TRUTH)Multiplayer is buggy as ridden with issues and absolutely dominated by hackers.3/10 major feature of the game does not perform even moderately well.
0;Single player is fun however you can't use mods unless you want to risk being banned. Multiplayer is a huge pain in the to play consistently with friends. Loading screens everywhere. This game is a really hot chick with a lot of mental issues hidden on the inside.
0;"""I wouldn't recommend investing a bunch of time in this game anymore.the Single player is fine but online play has a bunch of issues money being removed from your bank because you received money from a hacker is fine but when they remove legitimately earned money they're just saying """"don't play this game"""".So... don't play this game."""
0;3 ING HELMETS THAT DO NOTHING ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A ING SPORT CAR. HIGH END APARTMENT WITH 10 CARS GARAGE AND EVERYTHING COST 200K. A ING MOTORCYCLE WITH AVERAGE PERFORMANCE WITH BOOSTER COST 750K. VEHICLES THAT COME WITH DLCS COST AN ARM AND A LEG
0;The game is currently riddled with hackers. Every server you go on there's a 90% change there will be someone currently using mods in that server. The game has a lot of interesting aspects and eastereggs amoung other things. But the hackers ruin it for everyone. I encountered four hackers today alone most from China. I'm giving this game a 3/10 with hackers. If Rockstar would get off their asses I would give it a 9/10.
0;1) Bought game played with friends had fun and stopped for the day.2) Next day was in a 2 man heist mission with a friend riding in a car (im not driving the car) and poof banned for no reason.Note My friend isn't banned. Edit #1 Support ticket is useless. They copy and paste same sh'it.Edit #2 Banned again. Just by playing with friends for heist missions and such
0;It was a wrong move to take a step toward a modding tool that didn't actually touch multiplayer assets. Modding is the only thing keeping this game relevent. Without modding the game is incredibly lacking. Mods are the main reason this game is still relevent today. Especially in the RP communities. I can't recommend this game now due to the lack of respect Take 2 is showing.
0;The ONLY way this is fun is if you cheat in money and of course you will get banned. Basically Rockstar want to steal your money by either making you purchase thousands of real dollars in Shark Cards or by having to buy a new copy of the game whenever you get banned.They are absolutely the worst developers out there.
0;While it is one of the best pc ports out there and sets the standard for pc devs. The dispicable marketing and horrendous abuse of the steam sale system is completely uncalled for by a dev of this popularity and magnitude. Not even to mention the neglect of the game post hackers to solve it has undoubtably birthed my negativity for the game. Hence my lack of a recommendation and urge for new lookers at the game to try and buy it as cheap as possible leaving little money for Rockstar.
0;Forsure R* does not give a f**k about you after u bought the game even thoug the sharkcards . U will get banned for doing nothing ! U can try to appeal the ban but all you can get is a automatic copy respond from the system( that what happen to me) u bought all the thing but the power belong to them and they can take it from you every single ban wave ! u own nothing people . ! i repeat one more time do not buy this u will waste your freaken money so easily w
0;The game ceased to be fun especially since the price of new products is very high and make that kind of money is impossible.My opinion about this game a fully negative. I would like more opportunities to earn and only then can we play this game and get it at least some fun. 2/10 (the game disgusting)
0;Unless you've got deep pockets or just want to play the single player mode there's no reason to buy this game anymore. Rockstar is just pandering to their users who continue to purchase in game currency. Every new vehicle/item they add in the game continues to go up and up in price.
0;Used to be fun. Not much to do after you finish the story. Payouts online are ridiculously horrible. Even when doing a CEO mission your location is revealed to everyone. Even hunting a CEO doesn't get you much. This is a way for Rockstar to get you to buy expensive shark cards.
0;Used to love this game untill rockstar made it a pile of crap! Taking everything away from players that have done nothing wrong. Countless emails and phone calls to sort issues. But still no cooperation. Would not recommend this game to anyone now. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!
0;Take Two Interactive have decided that they wanted to go 1 up on Bethesda's paid modding up and completely disallow modding all together. Well that is just ing brilliant isn't it we only paid 40 pounds for your game that is years old and has not dropped in price at all since initial release. I am still at the start of the campaign on this game because I only brought it for mods you T2.
0;This game is absolute You can get banned just for some hacker gave you a money. If you try to play this game you will have to spent 5 hours trying to do a mision because matchmaking is absolute How can Rockstar expect people not to do money cheats if their missions are crap the game just doesnt work fine. This game is overall
0;Rockstar's logic 1) Single player modders are enjoying our game by making it their own with said mods? NOPE! CEASE AND DESIST !2) Online hackers roam free and steadily kill what's left of our online community? Lmao I don't really feel like dealing with that rn p
0;Let's put it simple. This is literally the worst online game ever made.The worst lobby system ever made.40% of the time in this game is waiting for it to join load or to restart because it once again broke.Cheaters everywhere.YOU get banned if the cheater is with you on the same server.It's an endless money grind to ensure rockstar sells their ing shark cards.The single player is quite fun if it the game starts at all because of their ed up DRM.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game.
0;Online is a huge grind and a money trap.There are only a handful of co op heist missions to make it worth playing.Singleplayer is meh. The technical quality is obviously there.But the content is generally uninteresting and uninspired.Also i hate waiting through countless loading and lobby screens. Just make a better UI.It is underwhelming for the game with the highest budget in the world.
0;multiplayer sucks big time I feel sorry for my kids who just spent their christmas money to get GTA 5 only to get smacked every time they play online and have modded players showering them with money trying to get them banned totally destroying the multiplayer experience
0;it is an amazing game and i have had it on the xbox360 as soon as it came out when there were funny glitches and not over priced stuff now it has got boring just constaintly grinding for money. i really dont like the game thatmuch any more rockstar stop over pricing stuff please
0;Modding is the best part of this game but what did you do for s sake!&gt Don't use mods even for single player&gt Also discord or curse when it hooks into a game via an overlay can get you banned.. (ridiculous) You know what? Go to hell Rockstar and Take Two
0;Worst. Balance. Ever. 35 special bullets for heavy sniper rifle? 11 mags 20 shots each for assault rifles? ARMORED Tampa's windows can dissapear by car crash? Screw this APB is better for now (and FREE). And with normal combination of clothes. And customisation. And woman clothes. And girls looks like girls actually. APB Reloaded remember this. Zero cost zero cheaters zero empty headed deaf developers.
0;game worked for about a week and it was awesome and then one day it just stopped getting past the rockstar social club loading screen. i cant even play the story mode.. this is why people pirate games.. maybe i should start doing that instead of giving my money to these companies. ive tried talking to their support team and theyre helpful but they dont know how to help me.. wow waste of my 50 dollars
0;GTA was a great game on Xbox and playstation but due to rock stars decisions to allow GTA to be modded on PC destroyed it. Online sessions are full of modders who are out to ruin your good time. Story mode is the only bit i still enjoy playing. Until Rockstar finds a way to implement anti hacking this game will slowly die off.
0;Dont buy this game you will get banned because there are tons of modders dropping money. And no the modders dont get banned only the victims the people who wanna play fair game but the game is ruined by the modders!!! i suggest not to buy this game because this is waste of money and time because at last your account will be banned and your profile will be wiped and even if its unfair ban the support team will just say there is nothing we can do and so go your self!
0;"""Bring back mods no one should support this awful move. It does nothing but screw over their customers in an act of greed. Their recent acts show that they care more for squeezing every last drop out of you in the form of shark cards rather than providing an open community. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone until they allow the free """"marketplace"""" for modding games that we own."""
0;What Blue Hole done is selling game then making Cheats and sell thoso cheats then baning idiot cheaters and selling game to them again and the circulation goes on.sometime like this time the game gona fill with cheaters in all servers and the game sucks.damn you Blue Hole and damn you idiot cheaters.
0;Now that Take Two has banned singleplayer modding which didnt have anything to do with online cheating (OpenIV even had preventative measures to make sure it couldn't be used online) I can with 100% certainty not recommend this game.The story was fun to play and all but...Online is a massive grind to buy literally anything (even clothes are inhumanly expensive)You could still have fun when playing with friends on a private session but thats about it.
0;Only play this game if you truly want to experience the single player or if you have a few friends to play in a private room. Every public room I've been in has been plagued with cheaters which'll prevent you from doing some fun open pvp. If you don't have 3 other friends to do heists it can be a pain to communicate to people since most of them don't speak english.
0;Its a moneygrab what can i say i bought the game at full retail price with a big shark card to start and catch up to my friends a few weeks later i get perma banned for hacking. Overall rockstar has $80 and i have nothing with them saying go f yourself. 2/10 it was fun before i got banned and its a company who has no regard for its community. I dont normaly give a bad review but this is well deserved...
0;jst buy this game heist to get some money finnaly can become ceo buy warehouse sell 3 crates for $90k now they update the game and i can only sell 4 crates for $40 k wtf bro you can no longer get money in game even if you can it takes you forever hahahahaha
0;you Take Two. you.Edit These negative reviews from the public seem to have beaten the whole issue. Rockstar issued the statement against Take Two and OpenIV is now back. Yet I still hate Take Two. And I stand by what I said.I'm not changing this review or editing it unless another development on the issue happens.
0;Good gameplay although the story characters and physics are a downgrade from the previous game. The modding is the main attraction of the game for me since I have no interest in Online so the recent attack on the modding community by Take Two has forced me to leave a negative review.
0;The most expensive shark card for $99 that gives you 8mill wont even cover the cost of a 10mill plane in game.If you don't want to spend real money for ingame money you could always grind missions that pay 10K for a week straight so you can maybe buy something nice.
0;my 3rd review.not a surprise that gta has gone down hill.singleplayer is absolutely fine and maybe the only part of gta actually worth playing because online is broken and full of cheaters. servers and players.good luck trying to find enjoyment without anyone else to play it with.
0;"""Rockstar support is aids. I was browsing the military vehicles to see which ones required a bunker to purchase when i accidentally miss clicked and bought a car cause for some awful reason there isnt a """"are you sure option"""" when i reached out to rockstar to request a refund on the car they gave me a generic response. So there goes my hard earned 2 mil and this game"""
0;GTS Online Capitalism in a nutshelll.... grind for HOURS AND HOURS to get the same things the rich kids can buy instantly with Daddy's credit card.Finance &amp Felony DLC $15 million ($200 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Inport &amp Export DLC $25 million ($300 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Gun Running DLC $23 million ($300 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Smugglers Run DLC $48 million ($600 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Rich kids and greedy corporate bosses at Rockstar RUIN the potential this game has.....
0;Do not buy this game anymore unless you wish to start completely from scratch. Say goodbye to your other characters they no longer support character transfer which is a damn shame. Do not waste your money if you want to play online stay on your old console.
0;Seen this a lot lately a lot of people getting banned for no reason. Some for modding but a percentage not. As far as im concerned I'm being wiped for nothing i have friends that have modded in the past *wont release names* asked them nicely to not spawn money on me or mod my cars or anything Played legit finally got the 2M from heisting properly with friends. AAAND 3 month ban Welp atleast i have time to play rainbow six now.
0;WORKING HARD TO MAKE MONEY FOR NEW GUNRUNNING DLC SELLING STUFF FROM YOUR MC AND CEO EVERYDAY FARMING HEISTS WITH YOUR FRIENDS HARDLY GET 6000000 DLC RELEASE DATE GOING ONLINE TO PURCHASE SOME OF THAT NEW MILITARY STAFF CONGRATULATION U'VE GOT 7000 INSTEAD OF YOUR ACCUMULATED FUNDS AND A NEW MOTIVATION FOR PLAYING NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO DELIVER A CAR WITH YOUR CEO TO EARN MONEY TO PAY THE BILLS AND SALARY FOR YOUR MC STAFFThe best DLC 10 wasted gaming hours out of 10. Thank you rockstar.
0;I wont even play online because of the price of everything.. 100 real world dollers will get you 8 million in game but most of the good stuff cost about a couple million anyways. So your going to spend 100$ on 1 or 2 items which is crazy. I used to respect R* but now since they went online they are nothing but crooks trying to scam their players in to spending money on their stupid shark cards.
0;200+ Hours On File 4 Years Of Online This Game Has A Wide Variety From Either A Working Your a$$ off 24/7Or B Resorting To Hacking From How Utterly Hard It Is On A Low Rank And Just Trying To Get Some MoneyI Wish I Could This Game A Thumbs In The Middle Because Thats Really What It Deserves....Still $60
0;Take 2 the company that owns Rockstar the developers of the game shut down Open IV one of the best gta 5 modding tools. Not cool take two this is complete bull This has ruined the game do not buy if you want to buy the game for modding.Bethesda pointed a gun at modding and demanded it to hand over money.Take two Killed modding off thousands of people and dumped the body in a landfill.
0;dont get me rong its a good game and fun with friends but / gta 5 support is not somthing you wone talk about and modders. poeple who dont cheat get band and modders hmmm ???? wel buy the game and find out for your self telling you. you wone get your money back BDW dont try to submit a ticken when you get band voor no reason da wil only anser with a auto msg and wond replay on ban even if its a rockstar server error
0;The game is really pay to win. I got banned (permanently) for having my offline mods enabled while in a online session even though i was afk and didn't use them at all. GG there goes my gta online experience. Remember to not use modded clients in Online. game kinda sucks without mods tbh.
0;DLC after DLC..... So mostly you get a single player game and a pay to play multiplayer game. You have to buy Shark card after shark card to keep up with the newest content. after seeing how much the stuff would cost in the latest DLC I imediatly uninstalled the game. Bottom line I want a new GTA game or I'm not wasting my time and money anymore with rockstar games.....
0;Take2 microtransactions and there corporate greed. This is the worst they have taken a game that could be amazing and turned it into a giant pile of horse Half a billion dollars in microtransactions and not new game in sight what a ing joke. GTAV Take2 Rockstar.
0;R* you really need to do something with all the hackers!!! It seems every lobby I jump into anymore a hacker does some stupid stuff like spawn UFO's in the middle of town and then blown everybody in the lobby up. This is a issue as i am FORCED to play in a public lobby as you wont let me do my CEO stuff in a private lobby. Fix your game you lazy s and get rid of all the hackers 6 Dog Bones Out Of 10
0;"""Great game horrible servers. I wanted to support Rockstar for making a great single player game I bought the game.The multiplayer aspect (servers bugs in loading screens admin service) is horrible...I can't even play the game anymore because I simply get a """"cannot connect to Rockstar servers"""" error...I tried everything to make it work...Just go and buy PUBG forget this game...it was great but now its done...10/10 keyboard breaking simulator..."""
0;Normal people don't have time to grind out missions to make money to buy anything in the game anymore. Also I'm not wiilling to throw down $100 for 8 million just so i can buy one or two items from the new DLC (cash grab). Rock star and Take two NEED to grow up and stop this t. All you do is take the money and you don't care for the customers any more.
0;I redownloaded this game I was stupid enough to buy years ago just to mod it and try to make it a little bit more enjoyable and just the day I finish downloading it and decide to get to modding it Open IV disappears. Well I'll just have to disinstall it once more wasted my time
0;Playing mostly online mode. That being said every single time you play online there is a hacker. Bullet proof rocketproof making ur character fly across the sky to a point you have to restart your game. I don't know if they stopped cracking down on hacking but to experience it 5 times a day when playing is just annoying.
0;Ruined with tons of microtransactions and way too expensive vehicles and stuff and shark cards are ay too expensive too and the game is littered with cheaters and single player mods were ruined by take2 and they should rename the game to Grind Theft Auto V
0;Overrated game.I recommend it but only on sale.+Big map+Good shooting mechanics+Good optimization Story sucks Car physics arcade af Online Matchmaking sucks (long waiting times) Servers have way too few people for such a big map Customization is very limited Full price even though it's 3 years old
0;Singleplayer Yes.Multiplayer No.And multiplayer is the bigger more important aspect of this game according to Rockstar.Reason https //www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/5aqtql/falsely_banned_in_gta_online_my_experience_with/TL DR False bans and Rockstar.
0;This shameless Take2 moneygrabbing needs to end. I am now boycotting ALL GAMES Take2 is involved in untill they decide to reinstate mods for atleast single player modes.For me mods are about freedom and creativity. They took that so they could pile on the 3 billion dollars they already made off this game which is enough to run a small country. How much is enough?!
0;Too afraid to play because everyone is getting banned for using simple fix mods or for no reason. You really ed up now Rockstar you really ed up.**Update***How about instead of being greedy money grabbing bastards you fix the hackers running about and causing absolute havoc on the innocent players.
0;I absolutely do not recommend this piece of trash game The PC Version of GTA V lived from mods and now you take them away? Well done you just shot yourself in the head with that one RockStar. Have fun with all the negative reviews and bad press your gonna get ing idiots.
0;One of my favorite games ever created but until Rockstar starts giving a about it's players I can't reccomend it unless you want to play singleplayer which is great. Been playing since 2013 Xbox 360 got ed while taking a in a public lobby and I got a 30 day ban and my 4 year old online character reset. Rockstar.
0;Single Player is the best at least no rockstar junkies and noobs are at you i was currently enjoying multiplayer and buying money cash cards from the store and then all of a sudden they say you have been banned for exploiting money like wtf you cant do anything right so i think rockstar should sort there stuff out a bit overall the single player is the funnest
0;Take two I know! Lets remove OpenIV all our fans will love it!*Charges OpenIV Developers*OpenIV Developers Guys were sorry but we cant do the Mod anymore.Everyone TAKE TWOAnd i agree with everyone else.Game The game is amazing i really do love it.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;Stupid developers can't prevent the hackers from ruining the gaming experience for normal gamers . I love GTAO but this game is full of hackers I'd not recommend anyone to buy GTAO rather suggest the people who wishes to buy this game not to waste money for it.
0;"Bluehole? More like . this piece of game that the developers have neglected to the point of retardation. Get skins more maps throw goddamn tomatoes but heaven forbid we actually fix the rampant amount of cheating. you. In all seriousness. Dont bother buying this game if you already haven't. Wait for ""Isle of Nyne"" to come out and this game will disappear quicker than a hyped up Ubisoft game."
0;The Multi Player is basically the main game and is one big pay to win scene. That reason alone is enough reason for me to downvote the game. The Single Player (story mode) is however a nice play although it feels limited. Get the game on a discount if you can.
0;When you do the Fleeca Job in the final act the helicopter does not pick you up. We've tried like 6 times and nothing. We gave up and then rock star send me a message saying like 'leaving heist early will give you bad points' and i am like. 'hey leaving buggs will result in negative steam review points!'
0;ready for more is less GTA style? pay to win? AI NPC's popping in out of thin air when you are out of their aimbotting range? can't get basic features(?) of the game to work right but you can take a selfie with the in game phone camera? cool. cars stuck in 2nd or 3rd gear awesome. get ready to be disappointed like never before. its 2017 trump is the potus and gta v online is the best game out. get used to the future suckas. (
0;This is one of my favorite games and i can not stop playing it however. The amount of people getting banned for just playing the game and having fun is ing ridiculous. why they cant just let people play the game and if something actually seems wrong then ban them. An example of what is considered cheating is KILLING the same player over and over not just honking a horn. so get your together devs and ill change the vote.
0;This has the could have been a great game but the problem I have is Rockstar is a frankly terrible company that has no intrest in the quality of their products meaning that this game will have the worst community who will ever find that is full of modders with no greater goal than to make your life a living hell and Rockstar has thus far shown no intrest in addressing this problem nor any other they have come across after the game's initial release.
0;"""This review is for Online ModeGTA Online sessions has a lot of hackers constantly disconnects that set you instantly to singleplayer without ask for try reconnect again bugs long loading loading for everything more loading cars teleporting and laggy.i.e stupid thing Try join in a Heist lobby ok joined now try leave done without loading.Try join in a Heist lobby """"This lobby is full want join in queue?"""" no get a stupid loading for nothing."""
0;Only if you're willing to bear the terrible online missions and the cancerous community and rockstars slimy buisness greed it's immensly fun PvPing in freeroam and it's fun to play with friends but otherwise. A dissapointment for the 200m budget and the devs continuously working on online
0;The PC version just sucks. I will always hop in a lobby and theres a modder.The online mode just sucks and they do nothing to inprove it but just tell us if we wanna buy there shark cards. Rockstar why do you not use VAC you would have more cheaters banned.Story 10/10online 3/10Please rockstar improve you're game with VAC it would stop more cheaters and modders.EDIT I was banned for no reason please dont buy this
0;As is I can't recommend this for multiplayer. Cheating has run rampant and there are little to no lobbies without someone exploiting the game. Took all of the fun right out of multiplayer. Single player is still a lot of fun but it just isn't the same when only half of the game is usable without the MP content.
0;TakeTwo just sent a cease and desist to OpenIV.OpenIV is effectively the SKSE of GTA V (SKSE is needed for a lot of Skyrim mods).OpenIV isn't involved with GTA Online hacking or modding at all and only effects the singleplayer experience.This effectively shuts down GTA V modding.This is how you lose customers.EDIT No I don't care that TakeTwo's taken it back. I'm not taking this review down.
0;I never used to encounter a hacker in GTA Online until the last few months. Ever since the start of December I've been matched with hackers in every lobby. Now it's impossible to fly around peacefully without flying into stacked UFOs or even relax in my apartment without enemy tanks being spawned. Ban waves are given to the wrong people and hackers don't seem to be going anywhere. At this state I do not recommend GTA V for then Online Experience. Single player is ok however.
0;"""""""Hold on guys this'll be funny. Why don't we charge full retail price for a game but then make the online part of it near impossible to progress in without paying even more real life money?""""Can't wait for Red Dead 2 online to come out so I get to buy shark bonds"""
0;This game is like real life. Those who are trying to earn some money to buy themselves a decent apartment/car will be constantly killed camped and abused by those who swim in a pool full of money.Not to mention how horrible developers are by taking money from people that earned it legit because of modder issues.I wouldn't recommend You this game unless You have a crew to play with because it's impossible to play alone.
0;Suffering from High Inflation and low income u need to work for multi hours with ur company to just collect 1Million and u find you can t have any good stuff to buy !!!Also you just keep the game running for few minutes just to read a guide about the game you will find yourself kicked for being idle !!!
0;Take Two the company responsible for managing this game sued Open IV which is a small group that made software to allow you to customize your rides and a whole bunch of other stuff you couldn't do in game. Hence why I cannot recommend this game anymore...
0;I enjoyed the singleplayer to the max especially using HelixScripts and other hilarious mods. Multiplayer sucks your real life money up just so you can pay for their purposely overpriced items simply so you'll buy their cards instead of doing all the work. Why so many hours logged for myself? Because I do all the work instead.
0;Great single player game with a multiplayer aspect that is severely hampered by the ineptitude of the online team who would rather pump out lackluster events and shark cards rather than dealing with the toxic population of hackers. It seems every decently populated server has a hacker who would effectively sh*t on everyone else with their fun being at the expense of other players. Im fine with modding on an isolated server with your friends but how consistent this is pisses me off.
0;I really thought Rockstar would've come prepared for the PC community after their problems on release in 2013 for console. Online Servers are TERRIBLE. So many problems with framerate. It randomly goes down then up causing the game play to not be enjoyable.. I really hope they fix this. As of now I am deeply disappointed in this game!!
0;Banning people for no reason for using SINGLE PLAYER's mods... What is the point of playing it on a PC? Where is the freedom that sandbox games are supposed to give? Well... Mods are supposed to expand the life time of a game and also improve game's experience and that's just not possible on GTA V. I must say that I'm completely AGAINST ANY CHEATING/GLITCHING on ONLINE MODE since it is unfare with other players. Boo Rockstar!
0;PROS the story and overall gameplay ( in SP)CONS online is full of hackers that spawn you on hills or other things like that or give you lots of money presumably to get you or other players banned because they are bored or whatever. dont waste your time trying to report hackers because its not gonna work. You have to make like a 10 page spreadsheet of evidence for rockstar to even consider its worthy of a ban.
0;its a game for online play. You grind and grind and grind for nothing to show for it and they wonder why all these people mod the online infastructure. Because you do a 45 min job for 200k to help pay for 20k tshirt 35k pants and a 6m dollar car. don't waste your money.
0;"""Don't let the low hours fool you 300+ hrs on other portsGTA SingleplayerThe only reason I still play GTAGTA Online*Enters GTA Online gets a month ban next hour due to no reason* Laptop ver.

0;WARNING Do not buy if you are expecting to transfer your character from Xbox 360 PS3 Xbox One or PS4 because you can't! Rockstar stopped that feature and they also stopped the ability to use mods. Bring back the Character Transfer feature and bring back the ability to use mods.

0;Do not buy from Rockstar anymore Besides the obvious lack in support the games they provide is filled with hackers which makes the games unplayable.1/10 The 1 I give because of the story mode GTA Online is a pure waste of time.I literally spend 60 to buy a story mode I could've downloaded from The trust in Rockstar is gone I will not make the same mistake twice.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!Say NO to Rockstar.
0;Well once again R* dishing out bans for no reason with a very vague generic email Further tickets get you the same email in the form of a support reply all calls get you the same generic response. This company is literally run by ing idiots. This game is the virtual form of Trumps America Do anything suspicious BANNED Do anything legitimate we don't like... BANNEDDo anything other than let modders kill you... BANNED
0;The game outsie of single player is unplayable. Pay to win is out of control. Griefers are everywhere hacking and ruining the gaming experience. The only ones that get banne are the players doing nothing wrong. I keep uninstalling and reinstalling wanting it to be different but it hasn't gotten any better.
0;The game at its roots had potential but then Rockstar and Take Two figured out that they could make more money by adding pretty skins and a hard grind to the game than giving the players a fair progression. Now the game has fallen into chaos with high levels with miniguns and armored vehicles killing people who only have m9s. Its a crying shame that the came had to come to this but thats what happens when a game becomes a cash grab.
0;The single player game is great but the online is absolutely awful. The game is so reliant on the microtransaction system that the grind to get the valuable items is ridiculous. As a single player game it is nowhere near worth the full $60 price tag that it has from launch. If it was on sale for $20 it might be worth it.
0;I got banned permanently instantly for no reason! I hadent played for a couple of mounths now when i return to play online? I have never cheated in a video game not even call of juty. I don't even know how to anyways to start with.I love this game to much to even want too. I guess I don't even need to worry because I will never be able to come back! Rockstar spend more time banning the worng people rather than the real cheaters out there.
0;I adore this game. I truly TRULY do. This game was almost made for me. Keyword ALMOST. As I would have LOVED to try out the Carmegeddon mod I cant do that anymore. Not with R* being unjust as with their almighty banhammer! Banning some people for hacking and ruining the Online experience? Fine I could see that! Banning people for using a simple FOV Community fix? What the actual . Quit acting like a bunch of children R* and get your together before you lose a LOT of people.
0;"""Take Two is hammering nails on modding's coffin. This cannot stand. When all the updates were adding content to ONLY multiplayer no one was complaining. Why? Because single player mods would be able to put those items in single player. I'm SOOOO sorry if it isn't everyone that wishes to grind 1 billion hours to afford a jet that used to be spawnable by simply typingg """"jumpjet"""" 12 years ago. Take Two if you want this game to survive do NOT kill off modding."""
0;It was fun while it lasted. Now you got motorcycles flying around shooting at you in the sky goinh mach 1 and everyone is just a giant bullet sponge. You still haven't implemented stock trading in multiplayer you idiots. See you in a couple years for GTA 6.
0;I gotta say this one thing that is rockstar put zero effort to control modders they just ban accounts but do nothing about the game bug itself online is completly trash just like the pubg now used to have a lot of fun but now i just want to refund this game.I will no longer play this game until rockstar do something about it.
0;online is boring from grinding to get stuff you want they needed to do is put level caps on items in game a level 1 shouldent have a lock on launcher and a level 2 who glitched for money or got a shark card shouldent owna ing hydra i hope red dead 2 online dose things differently and makes jobs that make you money are also fun dont buy for online they are about to abandon it soon once red dead 2 comes out with its online mode. and for the love of god dont buy shark cards
0;full of bugs hackers griefers kids and mostly annoying peopleexcrutiating loading times freezes and disconnectsgrindfest with no decent ways of earning moneyfreemium fook ya oversingleplayer breaking bugsmediocre FPS gameplay and controlsno joystick supportlots of disappointment and time and money wastedcan't believe this game got mostly positive reviewsthe setting is nice thought really a shame that most peopledon't get to enjoy it.
0;This game is overall fun ovce you spend over $1000 on shark cards just to get a couple vehicles other than that its just not fun to grind for hundreds of hours for and then they took away modding thats used mainly for singleplayer and managed to ruin their reputaion in less than a week. all im gona say even trump didnt fuvk up this bad. GG rockstar GG.
0;GTA Online is absolutely not recommended. Puplic mode is FULL of hackers and Rockstar do nothing again all these suckers. Sorry but not possible to play on puplic hence thumps up!!! However is GTA Online in Crew Mode very good! It makes fun and have few nice Coop missions well done. ) Singleplayer Story Mode is great. Typical GTA TOP!
0;Update the damn servers so i can spend more time playing and less time staring at an endless loop of loading screens its been how many years and i still get stuck in never ending loading screens between lobbies. seriously Rockstar!? Continually unimmpressed. maybe ill try again in another 3 months. still cant recomend this game
0;Rockstar does not care about its players. The online game is full of people cheating and modding forcing other people into cages and dumping money on them. Rockstar does nothing to prevent the real modders and cheaters they want you to buy shark cards and that is all. The anti cheat code they wrote is garbage banning normal every day users who spend money on their product. How could this be good for business? A real clusterfk you found yourself in Rockstar. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
0;Great single player but you expect that.Cess pit multiplayer. If you dont use private lobbies youre gonna have a bad time. Its a real shame the cheats/hacks/mods are so relentless online and interfere with EVERYONE in a session. Otherwise this game would be fantastic all over.Dont be a jerk. Use your mods in private with your own buddies.
0;You will find yourself disconnecting from every lobby you join and waste a whole lotta time trying to join back but the 5 minute long load screens make it a challenge to play this game where is has the same connection bugs it had since 2014. WP Rockstar instead of releasing your next content patch how about you fix your game
0;Heres how you fix gta onlinemake stuff way way way cheaper.sports cars 100k maxsuper cars 500k maxtransforming cars 800k maxfacilities and bases 1 mil maxThats half the problem of the game right there.Fix the servers and ban the modders than you have a great game here that will last a long time. But as it stands its the laziest cash cow i have ever seen in my life.
0;I loved it when it came out but the absence of ANY dlc for the SP and the overt focus on a MP has shown the greed of Take2. This has set the tone of how they wil treat FUTURE INSTALLMENTS. NOw this ban on OpenIV is jsut anti consumer. IF you cant give us story DLCs you got no job banning modder tools you greedy s.
0;Come on Take 2 do you really have to be greedy enough to milk a game that you've already made millions or even billions of dollars out of. All you are doing is get people to hate you and eventually stop playing the game cuz the only fun thing about singleplayer gta is mod now.
0;Sure the story is excellently done and the online aspect of the game can be fun even though it's extremely grindy if you don't have the disposable income to pay for shark cards. Rockstar may continue to add more vehicles to the online to keep the 10 year olds happy but they still need to acknowledge what the majority of players have been asking for. We want steam trading cards rockstar.
0;"""I ing hack rockstare are you afraid you kuks! a yuu rocker star no more candy for you! Al l my friend hate yu kuks no honor get A lyf ples! Rocker how can yu do tis no ok i vill never forgivem never forget today is sad day!"""" Rockerstar I am disapoint. I don like you anymore!"""
0;I loved Grand theft auto 5 until they turned around and killed the modding scene. I will lift this negative review when they come to their senses and revert this attack on their very own community.You've just cut holes in your pockets take two. I think i just heard a coin fall.
0;Rockstar is the stupidest game company dare I say even more stupid than EA for discontinuing OpenIV a modding platform. So sad the only reason I waited for GTA 5 on PC was to play it with mods now it's just plain old GTA 5 that we've all seen and played 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times. (
0;This series is importsnt to me. I've played it since 6 years old in 2002 starting with GTA III. I grew up on this game it it truely breaks my heart to give it a negative review.I can no longer in good conscience reccomend Grand Theft Auto V. Clyde Speed Tommy Vercetti Carl Johnson forgive me.Rockstar please lose these image ruiners Take Two Interactive. Because as long as they have ANYTHING to do with you I refuse to buy GTA VI.
0;you R* GTA modding is the only thing keeping your game alive and you royaly ed that up now. Lmao don't buy this trash if you're planning to mod the single player. Oh but god forbid all of the dll injector mods for online still work but you dont patch that. off!
0;"""Today I realised what """"Take Two"""" actually stands for. You get ed in the whilst a massive is shoved down your throat.Edit Rockstar and Take Two allowed mods again which is great but my review still stands. Online is filled to the brim with modders that make the game unplayable unless you get an empty session. Rockstar should have sorted this out by now. I guess they are just perfectly content with just releasing new content and selling more Shark Cards. I'm done playing this game."""
0;The only reason why I bought this game for the third time is for modding. GTA has a long running modding community with some great additions to the single player mode that has been abandoned by Rockstar and Take Two for ages. You won't be able to push us all to the online version filled with micro transactions.
0;No modding in singleplayer allowed while online nothing is done against the lobbys full of hackers. Play legit earn some money and get it taken away if youre unlucky to be with a hacker in the lobby. But hey you could always buy sharkcards to satisfy Take Twos hunger for more money. Bye felicia
0;All of my hours are online play. This game is 10/10 I love getting perm banned for no reason and then when you go to try and ask why you got banned they just tell you that there are many way that a person could be banned which I did none of them. The online support sucks if you can call them which may take a while they are pretty chill sometime and are helpful. But the Online support sucks.Thanks R*10/10 Uninstall Button works10/10 Support
0;Taking away the ability to mod this game makes it virtual sh!t its no longer fun or realistic and the developers and take2 need to fix themselves. Seriously the base game isnt fun after only a couple hours unless you mod some cool effects and weapons in.
0;I REALLY ING HATE THIS GAME. I just got banned for 30 days and I didnt even do I'm not a hacker trying to get sympathy I dont even know how to ing install mods. I logged in it said i was banned and that all my would be reset. GTA VI is not gonna be in my library at all nor will i ever spend money to buy fake money on this game
0;Don't buy this game unless you just want to play and mod on singleplayer only. Online theres to many modders that ruin the fun for others and i got permantly banned because of a random modder framed me by killing everyone under my name i reported it to rockstar to unbann me but they won't do anything.
0;i'm just going to drop some complaints here memory leak lack of single player DLC you can at least get some activities you can do and vehicles in online to SP speaking of Online online full of unbanned modders loading time combined with memory leak makes the time window you have to enjoy the time even narrower the shameless promotion of shark cardsif you want to get this game get it in a massive discount or a free event(if thats possible)
0;trying to make money on gta online is really hard. the jobs you do dont make you enough money. everything is pricey. you could be playing for 8 hours and make about $100.000. but you buy one thing and all of that money its gone. If you have lots of money. rockstar will think you modded and they will take all that money away and leave you with nothing. This game was good . but not anymore.
0;Very fresh and exciting!!! This will take some getting used to though!UPDATE Go die taketwo and rockstar I play singleplayer with mods and you take away my fun I had without that stpuid multiplayer drama. Forget you and the riches you made from your bland game that was only fun for a week without mods.
0;The singleplayer is excellent don't get me wrong but the multiplayer (while fun if you have a decent amount of in game money) is blatantly based off of a free 2 play business model. Seems like Take Two really loves their whales. Not only that but modders run rampant online and they have since the game first launched. Keep that in mind before you decide to purchase this game.
0;Why did so many people buy this game? To mod. What did Rockstar do? Remove the biggest modding program the game has trying to make people pay more for micro transactions after being the 4th best selling game of all time all they want is more money and removed the ONLY reason people bought GTA V multiple times. Nerd3 sent me here and I urge everyone else who has loved to mod to give this game a negitive review because thats the only way they'll listen.
0;"""Take two just essentially banned modding for this game because they said (Paraphrasing) """"They are under monetizing their users"""" Basically not using enough micro transaction to milk their player base. And the only way they can increase the monetization is by getting more players into the online segment where you can buy in game cash."""
0;With the modding scene shutting down because of the take down of open4 there is no reason to buy this game the online section is a micro transaction hellhole and the parent company taketwo are trying yo ruin the singleplayer so you have to pay for things in online due to this i am no longer planning to get borderlands presequel and squad when they go on sale because taketwo owns those games aswell. . Take. Two.
0;i bought this game to mod and because take two is too greedy to care about their players. ive wasted my money. Dont buy this game and boycott take two until they let open IV back. Also sign this petition https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;I have only one thing to say pray the demons away from GTA V!!! Exorcizamus te omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica potestas omnis incursio infernalis adversarii omnis legio omnis congregatio et secta diabolica.Ergo draco maledicte ecclesiam tuam.Secura tibi facias libertate servire te rogamus audi nos.
0;the single player is cool but not updated. gta online is in a critical state right now OpenIV the actual ban wave of legit players the mechanic they added in car handling files recently... there are way too many reasons to not buy this game now extremly long loadings getting stuck in loadings lobby system P2P... a lot of wasted potential this is way too much now i can't recommend this game anymore.
0;The game was fun and ran fine until the newest patch 1.28 came out. Now it's hard to get even a stable 30 fps on the lowest settings possible. I have a gtx 960 from evga which runs most games beautifully. It runs the witcher 3 with ultra settings smoothly without any hitches. But in GTA V this latest patch completely destroyed performance with my fps dropping into the single digits so low that the game is unplayable. Until this is fixed I do not recommend buying this.
0;"""#RIPMODS UPDATE The issue is resolved as far as I know.""""Why's yer review still negative?""""Because why are we only slinging our because of THIS bad thing they've done? Why not throw for the greedy money grubbing used in Online play? Why did we draw the line at mods? How bout we get the mutiplayer we and the game deserve? micro transactions. the grind. Give us the best game get the best reviews."""
0;terrible not the game but i have a good computer that can run everything on high but this just happend online and story takes about 40 minutes to load and i have great wifi and when i get in the game crashes or lags really bad sometimes when i tab out it brings me to a black screen causing me to restart my pc wish game actually worked
0;"""Even though I spent quite some time playing this game and thought it was """"good"""" no I just think it is complete trash I mean making modding illegal? Are you ing serious? It was the main selling point of this game and you decide to remove it? Take two just can't admit that their game is trash without modsOpenIV will always have my support."""
0;The game is not even about skill or hours put into the game anymore. It's about who put most money into the game. You can do a heist prep only to get killed by somebody with an op armored vehicle that shoots rockets. When they're on foot you're most likely able to kill them as they got no skill but as soon as they enter their tank (which requires 10 rockets to be destroyed) you're ed.
0;2k games are trying to crush the singleplayer users by sending a cease and desist order to the mod OpenIV in order to force more people to use multiplayer for new content and therefore milk them for more Micro transactional income. Disgraceful tactics. Do not buy this if you intend to mod it.
0;"""Fun at first the single player is about what I expected from GTA. But after wrongly having most of my funds removed online for """"manipulating other player levels and money"""" and then being treated like a piece of meat from their support I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone unless you get it for free."""
0;You need to have high amounts of money in online which has encouraged way too many hackers in public lobbys Online missions are forced to public lobbys only so that content is gone unless you're luck enough to not have a hacker in your server. unless you find getting blown up over and over again by a script kiddy don't bother with this game.
0;Since launch they have steadily gone in a single direction.And that direction is straight towards the bottom of a garbage bin called GTA 5.I can't think of a single good thing they have managed since I started playing that can even try to counteract the pathetic excuse of game management they have attempted at.
0;Take two is ing over the community by being greedy scum lords. They are biting the hand that has fed them. If you own a product you should be allowed to use in your own way as long as you arent hurting others. ie. hacking online. If you just want a ing grappling hook or to be able to play as jesus then why the shouldn't you be able to. take two. their greed. just for the love of god don't blame rockstar
0;As a person who does not and has not used OpenIV in the past even I can say what an absolutely horrific and abhorrent decision it was on Take Two/Rockstar/etc's part to target OpenIV. What a complete cop out and lazy action. If this is how they handle their user base then the message is loud and clear they do not want my business. I'll make sure I don't give them any business ever again.
0;Story Mode Boring No one plays itGTA Online People only play the game for Online So frightening that it has so much less than story mode You need money for absolutely everything Its impossible to get money Public servers are full of s Too many other flaws to point out
0;"""you take 2. we pay 80 dollars for the mods and you just ing shaft us by killing like 2 thirds of the modding communityso if you want to """"support the modding community"""" off with the cease and decists with open iv because they arent the ones using it for malicious reasons its the people that hack open iv to allow mods on multiplayer not open iv just make a pre game check to see if theres any mods and just disable online entirely for thoes people ez pz kill me pleasy"""
0;The open world nature of the game is great driving around shooting running people down all the stuff you would want in gta is fine for me though that's where the greatness stops. The failures to connect to the gta online servers through 2 seperate internet connections constant grinding for money with most items ingame overpriced and bugs ingame that still to this day have not been fixed have me seriously questioning my decision to purchase this game in the beginning.
0;Decent GTA overall but Online is a grindfest for the smallest items. R* wants you to buy some virtual cash. You don't. You mod instead because thug life. Then you get banned because thug life. Then you come back after your 2 week ban and enjoy the stuff you cheated to get because thug life. This isn't what I did I swear. Thug life.
0;I will never buy a rockstar game again. Moved my computer to the front room to play on my big screen and it won't let me play the game in offline mod. It said it has to have the Internet to authenticate. Wow I've already authenticae and played for a few week but soon as it don't have Internet it don't work. If it was a subscription service i would understand but when you buy something it should be your.
0;Never playing again and unistalled it to. Tried playing last night and the same person joing my lobby and keeps killing me i switch to a diffrent on and he follows and does the same crap he allways knows when i get on to never playnig this crap again. Thanks jessie go ing kill your self
0;Yesterday in GTA Online i felt hungry so i drove up to the burger shot take out to order two number 9's a number 9 large a number 6 with extra dip a number 7 two number 45's on with cheese and a large soda.Game decided that i was being a fatty and banned me for a month10/10 Would get banned again
0;Played around 1200+ hours of this game never modding or using exploits bar some of the clothing exploits. Just received a notification that I've been banned and had my account wiped for something I've never done. tar and their greedy parent company Take Two would do well to stop banning people for no reason and fix their tier customer support.
0;Gameplay aside... Optimization is terrible. Online services and reliability are terrible. The game can be fun when it works. I would recommend the single player for a run through but play the multiplayer at your own risk of ruining a halfway decent experience.
0;It would be nice to do CEO and Biker gang stuff in a private lobby with friends instead of being ed over by some flying around in a jet because he has nothing else to do. And yeah the hacking scene in this game is beyond ed every lobby I join there is some Russian or Mexican guy hacking
0;Product received for free. Why are lobbies always full of a million players making it IMPOSSIBLE to do ceo and bunker stuff along with lobbies with modders and hackers. Loading also takes A F*CKING WHILE.There should at least be a way to fix thisBut no its RockStar so they dont give any about us but our money.
0;This game is amazing and after 300 hours in this game I would usually recommend it. Although for some reason my entire account including my game somehow dissapeared and I do not event have a social club account anymore. Rockstar support was no help at all saying that I didnt have the game purchased. I am forced to create a new steam account and rebuy the game if I ever want to be able to play it again.
0;Guarenteed modders/script kiddies in every lobby.This was an amazing time a while ago but stay away from GTAO. While there are opportunioties to grind out all your cash that's all it is. GTAO is a mile wide and an inch deep. T2 doesn't care anymore and neither should you.
0;Use to be good but then they just gave up on the community to change the game into a money machine with no regard for the players.Not to mention the C&amp A order on OpenIV which basically stopped modding in the game (online or Solo)I understand the reason for not wanting modders in Online as they ruin the game but all that people who mod in single player are trying to do is to get some more gameplay out of this dry game.
0;There's very little that can be said. The hacking is so insanely rampant in this game that it is borderline unplayable. I have just switched sessions 4 times only to find hackers disrupting the gameplay in all of them. It is horrific. Absolutely do not buy if you are hoping to play online. Despite a pretty good platform there is no fun to be had.
0;Pros Great storyCons Online is just a money business. I really regret buying this game and spending time online..If you expect crazy stuff like the trailers...sry but it will not happen... however if you have a lot of money (real money) buy some shark cards and enjoy the out of it
0;HEY TAKE 2 GO YOURSELF THE ONLY REASON PPL BUY THIS ING GAME IS TO ING MODPUTTING DOWN THAT CEASE AND DECIST LETTER TO GARNISH MORE MICRO TRANSACTIONS THE ARE U THINKINGMORE INFO ON THAThttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_okWE ONLY MOD TO MOD THE SINGLE PLAYER THATS ITNO ONE ING CARES ABOUT THE MULTIPLAYER NO ONERETRACT THAT LETTER U ING COWARDS
0;You'd think they would deliver the story DLC they promised.You'd think they would care about their most sold game.You'd think they would support mods.No they focus on microtransactions and dumb vehicles for the multiplayer.Will this happen to RDR2? Most likely.Will R* continue down this line of garbage? Oh yes they will.
0;Take Two have attempted to take down the modding community that keeps this game from being solely a money grabbing pile of ****. With that in mind and since they clearly couldn't give a toss about what the community wants do not buy until they change their approach. Single player is ok but the multiplayer is just awful and the biggest grind you will ever face unless of course you spend hundreds of real pounds/dollars on in game money.
0;Take Two have recently decided to basicly gut the modding scene of GTA offline OFFLINE. They arent focussing on hackers in Online no they basically decided that you can chnage your version of GTA 5. This they are doing to push people to GTA Online because there are micro transactions in GTA Online. Do not spend any more money on this t company Take Two ownes Rockstar and 2K)
0;It's more and more of an obvious money drain for players. Now that modding and hacking have been totally destroyed the singleplayer will never get any better and the multiplayer's just one big stupid grind for stuff that doesn't serve any in game purpose anyway. And the house always wins now. Everythings too expensive.It sucks because this game WAS good. But now I'm uninstalling.
0;The campaign is fun to play once. The online mode has some funny missions but also many issues. Bugs cause inconsistency so you never know if the game is going to work or not. This is particularly an issue when you are doing heists which are time consuming and must be restarted if anything goes wrong.There is also a problem with hackers that ruin the online experience.
0;This game is literally unplayable for me. Every 15 20 minutes it crashes randomly. Tried every fix I could but none of them work.Not to mention how horrible the gta5 community is also filled with modders that will spam random bombs or npcs on you.I can't recommend this garbage game. I don't care about modding in sp or anything this game is utter garbage.
0;Cool game until you get banned for no reason. You can call email Rockstar all day but they just wont respond. And if they finally repsond after many days of emailing you get an automated message back saying that you got banned for modding (something I will and never have done) SO Frustrating please rockstar fix your banning system everybody is complaining
0;Do not support Take Two and the greedy actions they have recently taken the developers have chased away the modding community all in the name of profit. If you already have this game don't play it or buy any ingame microtransactions like Shark Cards. Do not feed the greed of Rockstar and their publisher Take Two interactive.
0;For a 4 year old game that is still full price it is riddled with mirco transactions and its only getting worse with the new restrictions on the single player modding community. I feel bad for Rockstar(developer) since Take 2(publisher) seems to be determined to ruin this game.
0;"""i got banned permanently for no reason. i did not use cheats or something on multiplayer i sent a request to rockstar support to get a reason but they said """"Your account has been permanently banned from GTA Online. All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed. Best regards."""" i spent much money and time for this game all these to get banned.. Thanks Rockstar games..."""
0;Well... This was a fantastic and very fun game... WAS. Now one of the only reasons I would play singleplayer anymore has been taken away. Thanks Take Two you guys are fantastic for shutting down a very popular and harmless modding service... Honestly what the actual **** were you thinking?? Really?
0;Greedy publisher and developer could not leave well enough alone. In a futile attempt to stop rampant cheating in their boring and grindy online mode (with fee to play cash packs) they have take legal action against the single player modding community and effectivly shut them down. This has done NOTHING to affect the state of online play as it was completly separate and different system.*slow clap*
0;Take Two compleltly removed modding from the game so they can squeeze more microtransaction money out and it's not something i support at all. Players bought the PC version for modding and now the ultimate playground is in multiplayer cause non of the new content ever made it to single player.Removing modding is not ok...
0;Welcome to a game where cheaters and modders rule the world. Rockstar did ban money hack/ glitches but never did anything about people ruining the game because it doesn't affect their bottom line like hacked money did.With all the new content it still is the same redundant stuff you have to do. The new missions are cool tho.
0;No mods currently do not buy this game. This game will not do anything to Take Two but we need to stick it to them when it comes to RD2. Let them waste a bunch of money making that game and when nobody buys it that will be when they see the true power of the gaming commuity.
0;I have played this game for 5.4 hrs today after I bought it. Saw guy who was destroying cars with one kick. Unwourable like he have god mod shoting rockets from his pistol... I don't want to play game that is full of cheaters and hackers. In that way game lost sense. Requested refound.

Children gets beaten by their parents launch GTA getting money and stuff from modder and start to ing interfere with making other's money. And then chat is like """"LOL"""" """"L2P NOOB"""" etc. You see there's no way for fair people to earn money.Make a ing PVE servers for people who want to cooperate in peaceful ways FFS."""
0;The online is terrible it's hard as hell to make money unless you grind for hours to buy one thing nobody joins the missions because they're terrible and the minigames just keep getting more and more ridiculous. This game is terrible for new players. Despite how the game is I still haven't been able to stop playing.
0;The blatent hostility displayed against the modding community here cannot be ignored.Take Two already got my money for GTAV but let this moment be a reminder of the number of customers in the PC community many of which purchased GTAV more than once BECAUSE they wanted to mod the game that will not be buying any subsequent games that you release.
0;The publisher engages in highly anti consumer behavior damaging single player experiences in order to try and squeeze every bit of money from the consumer they possibly can by restricting content to multiplayer making it cost ludicrous amounts of money and then shoving microtransactions in your face and actively trying to destroy single player mods.
0;Takeing out the modding while not effecting me was still a kinda thing to do I love this game and had some gud times back when I played games but you should not go back on your word and get rid of mods that were not harmful the modding was fun and I saw no evil in it for those who only mod single player with that in mind I cant give the review I want a postive one (
0;Take Two took something completely legitimate(modding) and ripped it out behind a BS lie all in the name of selling more shark cards as if selling hundreds of millions of dollars of them a year isn't enough. Thanks take two I'll never buy another game from you again.
0;"""GET A GRIP OF YOUR GREED ROCKSTAR AND TAKE TWO!!!! MODDING HAD BEEN THE HEART OF YOUR GAMES FOR SO LONG AND THAT'S WHAT MADE YOUR GAMES SO GOOD!!!! IF YOU'RE GONNA BE LIKE """"FK IT LET'S BAN THE MOD."""" THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR POPULARITY YOUR INCOME AND EVERYONE THAT USED TO LOVE YOUR GAMES!!!! YOU GUYS ARE SO NOT COOL WITH THAT DECISION!!!!"""
0;R* and Take Two Interactive have rly ed up the game. R* just removing my (not modded) money and when i contact the support i get a lazy answer that doesn't help at all. then we have Take Two ing up the modding community. now i'm sick and tire of these stupid people who up my experience with the game. i'm ot gonna play this game for a while.
0;There is no matter if GTA V is good or bad but it is about the relation of Take Two to it's customers and fans. Modifications has always been a part of GTA fan community and I feel a lot of solidarity to the ones who have always loved GTA IV mods. Take Two.
0;"""Okay so after a LOT of backlash OpenIV is back. This makes me happy. It's great that we as a community were able to make a difference.This however won't make me change my review. We may have OpenIV back but only because Rockstar convinced Take Two to allow it. Take Two is still against modding. Remember that. We saw """"the true side"""" of Take Two a company that gives 0 s about their customers."""
0;The devs don't care about the players. After I put in hours of playing this game to get about 5 million dollars I was AFK while a modder gave everyone in the lobby millions. And I didnt complain juist ment I could enjoy the new gunrunner DLC more. But these took ALL off the cash I had obtained...even the millions I put in hours of gameplay to get before the modder. I'm DONE with this company and will be less likely buy another game in the future from them.
0;Desperately needs proper anti cheat measures introduced. It takes half an hour to an hour to find a decent server without a modder or hacker in it even then the peace doesn't last for long before one arrives and starts spamming UFO's explosions that kill passive mode players and attaching NPC's to you until you crash.
0;"""At just under 500 hours I got temp banned because I was """"modding"""". I deleted and reinstalled the game after the 30 days even deleted my files and everything just to come back and find out I was now perma banned for no apparent reason. you Rockstar."""
0;Game is fun. Hackers ruin all of online play unless you ONLY play with friends. Rockstar gives 0 s about hackers. They have your money for the game already. That seems to be all they care about. If you want a good single player game go ahead. If you want to purchase for just the online play then you will have a great time watching a bunch of hackers wreck the game. Single PLayer 8/10Online 1/10
0;COMPLETE money grab super hard to make millions of dollars without buying shark cards.Servers constantly down even though Rockstar says they are up.Super buggy in lots of places.Overall would not recommend I would rather play SAMP(San Andreas Multiplayer)
0;Couple hundred hours on record. My wife and I log in to shoot the for an hour then log out. She gets an email saying her account has been banned for 30 days and her character has been deleted. We have only ever played this game legitamately. Unfortunately due to Rockstar's business practice towards its consumers and this recent calamity I will no longer be purchasing any product of Rockstar's or its parent Take 2 Interactive.
0;Don't hang open sanctions without saying a game player game player to feel the green on fire R star dog you know? Said the messy seal on the TM messy seal? Think well that players do not use TM to make money in this way please give the wrongly sealed player an explanation
0;modding has been the backbone of the GTA PC community For almost two decades. And is the reason many people bought GTA V on pc after already owning it on an other console. Despite this Take 2 have recently taken steps to dismantle modd in for GTA V. This is despite Rockstar themselves using mods as a selling point featuring mods prominently on there blog and website. Even using some in promotional material. As a result the future of GTA seems uncertain. Avoid for now
0;What. The. . This was a total mind .There were 5 hiests in single player. That honest to God sucks. I wanted to play more single player after I finsihed the story which is great by the way. And there are 6 hiests in online. That is ridiculous. I thought this game was great but this is a total dissapointment. There better be like 20 hiests in gta 6. Online and single player. And those better be included in the game and maybe some in the dlcs. Honest to God what an overrated game.
0;Take Two Interactive has targeted the innocent modding community. I encourage people to stop supporting the GTA franchise and all other T2 interactive games. The GTA V online expierience has just become a cash grabbing game. I have been playing T2's games for years and I have never seen such an idiotic move by them. This is not OK.On behalf of the modding community FIX THIS!Never playing or purchasing a T2 game again.
0;I like singleplayer mode very much and enjoyed it on the other side multiplayer is really poor and now they're blocking modding for SP expierence. Recent actions against alternative MP shows how they care about players and modders don't let them do that again. Not gonna buy another GTA if this doesn't stop.
0;Rockstar as a trend is slowly becoming the most scummy money hungry group of s on the planet. They charge out the for shark cards made several promises of money making opportunities yet you can only do them in public lobbies where hackers and s run rampant. Then to top it off they kill community mods which deliver actual meaningful content to this shallow game. This game exists going forward as nothing more than a means to sell shark cards. Pathetic.
0;Banning mods is not acceptable we pay good money for these games and limiting the creativity and fun from the game for more money is criminal developers please look at yourselves you USED to be a respectable game developer but obviously your just another EA not buying any more of your games or crappie in game micro transaction currency. GOODBYE!
0;I was suspended for 30 days after being a very clean player. Recent updates have been absolutely boring despite me having high hopes of this game. Started out strong but the update is just poor at this point. In addition joining online sessions is super slow buggy when switching game modes and random crashes in the game.Now with this buggy false positive ban I'm quite upset at this publisher.
0;The creators of this game have just recently shut down the most essential modding tool just a few days after the CEO said that they are under monetizing the players. GTA Online sucks now every new update only adds vehicles that are the exact same as all the others and cost 1 or 2 million. All they want now is for players to buy shark cards so no single player dlc coming any time soon. Take Two Rockstar this game.
0;Suddenly I cannot login even try 1.5hours. still not able to. there is no prior noitce and instructions. this is my first evaluation comment from all steam items but this is really terrible and horrible. Get back my money trashes. rockstar all idiots you all dead xuckers!!!
0;This game ing sucks. Rockstar did a terrible job at keeping Hackers offline. Every single ing server there is a hacker that slows down your FPS to 2! 2 FPS! Are you kidding me?Then the game goes back to 30 or 40 fps on my high end machine and then in 2 minutes back to 2 FPS! Then some hackers make everyone in the game die blow you up 10 times create large meteors... and rockstar isn't doign I want a refund worst $60 I ever spent in my life.
0;Open IV has been around since gta 4 hence the IV and now your just doing something because your not getting as much players on as you can even though your making more money then ever. People like me has bought the game multiple times. So you can go take your micro transactions and shove it up your
0;so instead of spending any money on anti cheat software to protect the online something in their job description! they decide to simply blame modders and ban all of it.............and the devs have lied saying open IV enables malicious mods that allow harrasment of players when open IV DISABLES ONLINE WITH ITS OWN MODS!!!!.shady greedy piece of publishers .devs that supported modding that now blame modding?!?!yeh its a show
0;Everythings over expensive just to push out more content for us to buy. Every update is the same just reskinned. It's ing boring as hell. There's nothing casual to do besides some broken minigames. And single player hasn't had updates in years. And of course the obvious modding problems.
0;Would I recomend this game well the answer is very simple. The reason I play on PC as the main plattform for gaming at all is cosumization. It is what made Need for Speed Most Wanted good it is what made GTA V not just a good game but a great game. So to conglude GTA with mods YES GTA like how it is turning (No mods) NO!
0;MP is repetetive and grindy as all hell. SP is neglected. Modding (OpenIV) has now been shut down meaning that the little fun you could create for yourself in SP and SP only (since O4 doesnt allow the game to launch online with modified RPFs) is now completely gone. So now you're stuck with the boring grinding and constant spawnkilling in Online or the boring repetetive experience of an unmodified SP with literally none of the MP cars weapons or features.
0;I only bought this game so I could download mods. GTA online sucks. Take two needs to step back and realize that slightly modifying the products THAT WE OWN is not illegal. There's no sinister intent to moding I'm just enhancing my own play. Take two &amp Rockstar are money hungry and want everyone to buy into the GTA online microtransaction scam. OpenIV is the only reason this game is worth buying/playing in my eyes. Asking for a refund.
0;I am definitely not going to recommend buying this game to anyone especially after the greed move of the pricing set for Israel a 99$ price for a 4 year old game (2013 Cancer release aka Consoles 2015 PC release). When the rest of the world gets it for 60$.
0;I've been playing for a month now and was just banned today absolutely no reason.No appeal no warning a month ban character reset to 0 and my account entirely wiped by rockstar because they felt like it.The only thing worse than the toxic online community are bans that seem to affect a tremendous amount of honest players.I will never buy another rockstar game for the rest of my life.I want my money back.
0;"""This is a great single player experience if you ever played a GTA game before you know what you're getting. But it's hard to recommend this when the developers put so much focus on the crappy multiplayer portion of the game and then shut down modding.It seems they expect you to just finish the story then jump on the loading screen fest they call """"multiplayer"""" and buy shark cards. Honestly just pass on this one."""
0;As someone who doesn't even use mods let alone touch the game anymore I can say that this is grade A t. You are out of your mind Take Two Interactive treating PC consumers like this whyo waited a whole year for the game with modding support and all the features a pc game should have.
0;just got into it for the modding only tasted a couple weeks of that sweet community nectar then I was torn from the teat. Hours spent suffering withdrawls cold sweats stress vomiting constant chills. Now in Christian reform help group and wearing cable knit sweatervest. 4.5/10 not even once.
0;All friends are having random disconnects server lag and hackers are running rampant. If you come here to play online and have no patience. KEEP LOOKING. If your usual way to find fixes is to check forums good luck youll have to open a support ticket. I've also heard of accounts being randomly deleted locked and servers are slow. DO NOT BUY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE PATIENCE AND WANT TO JUST PLAY ONLINE. BUT IF YOU LIKE THE SINGLE PLAYER GET IT.
0;Storymode is great but the problem is the ing devs abandon it for the online mode. Everything about online sucks. Heres just a few things wrong with it Everything costs WAY too much money (including the heists). You get a wanted level everytime you ing breath. Incredibly toxic. Takes 20 years to load one ing session.The only remotely fun thing about online is the RP servers but since it's Rockstar people get banned for playing in them. Last time I ever buy a product from this company.
0;"""Get usually suspended for no reason just because a cheater was on your server. And """"for safety reasons"""" Rockstar resets your account and deletes your character after 3 month suspension. Happens so often that i just don't bother contacting a support As if they would recover a deleted character that is deleted from the system lul. Fun until you get punished for nothing ). Good potential but they wont bother getting better any cheats. (Top selling game btw)."""
0;A massive waste of potential purely because of the greed from the publisher.extremely volotile attitude towards modding. Shutting down people who attempt to create dedicated servers endless multiplayer loading.I only kept playing at all because of friends even that wasn't very enjoyable or rewarding.Single player is alright.
0;The game was fun for the few hours it worked. Out of no where it randomly started getting huge lag spikes which continued even when i reduced ALL the settings to their lowest point. I didn't even get to finish story mode or play online.**** The game became completely unplayable. ****Would not recommend to a friend.Would even go so far as to say I probably won't be buying any more Rock Star games in the future. Good work with a broken game.Also found a lot of similar stories online.
0;The multiplayer of Grand Theft Auto V is worse than a mobile game. The single player campaign is incredible but now that you can't mod it is there even a point to owning it on PC?I've put over a thousand dollars into PC upgrades specifically for this game and Take 2 limiting it unnecessarily by attacking OpenIV is ridiculous.
0;Basically to sum all these negative reviews up Take Two the parent company of Rockstar sent a cease and desist letter to the developers of OpenIV an important mod to GTA5 and other rockstar games and told the developers that the need to stop what they're doing because it is in violation of their rights. Take Two is basically saying that to them modding is illegal.
0;I personally love the Story Mode and the game play experience (when solo)As for the online version users who scroll through here might see all the negetive comments.Full of hackers and most importantly something which happened to me. I bought shark cards but i did not receive the money in game.Dont think rockstar will be helping much since there are so many hackers out there which they themself are unable to resolve this problem. Play for fun will be ok dont get too serious..
0;The game is bloody dead years allready the only thing that saved it was modding but noooo they did not get enough money from a 4 year old game so make modding forbidden by law they guys are only in it for the money last game i ever bought from 2k. (even though i bloody love most of the games)
0;I waited to buy this on PC so I could mod it like previous GTA games.The short sighted decision by Take Two and Rockstar to ban mods has made me decide that this will be the last time this company will get any money from me.A company that doesn't care about their customers is a company I will not patronize.
0;Rockstar games has recently made a DMCA to modding tools for the single player in a cynical attempt to stop online hacking or to force more people to play multiplayer so people will pay for more shark cards.It is not a good idea to support a company that holds thier honest users and supporters in such cynical regard.
0;Unfortunately for as great a game GTAV is I can't support it now that Take two interactive have ordered a cease and desist on OpenIVEssentially this shuts down the single player modding scene. Keep in mind that OpenIV only affects single player so it has nothing to do with the abundance of cheaters in the MP sessions.
0;I cant reccomend this game after 140 hours the story mode is good but can get boring. In online mode there is way to many hackers and i dont think the devs do anything about it the only thing the've done is take away 7 million of my hard earned dollars for no reason which is stupid.
0;The way that Rockstar has treated the gaming community with what they've done to a company that has been one of their biggest supporters/enthusiasts (OpenIV) is extremely hostile to not just them but me personally.Ridiculous. We can't accept this what a way to treat the people who have helped your game sell much better on PC...hell it's why I even bought it on PC.Crap.
0;The more i play this game the more im convinced that R crew must be mentally challenged.Perfect world missions ai etc.And the words support system RDR2? HAhaha what a joke that will be.How big is the retard level at R?Bugges sell missions no fix glitches that makes people get money is fixed asap.Noever again an R game them.
0;This game is an amazing game but I can't support a company that would knowingly infuriate supossedly valued customers by destroying singleplayer modding in their game. Singleplayer modding is what kept this game alive for so long and why so many people still play it. Was the money worth it Take Two and Rockstar?
0;SPECSCPU i7 6700KGPU GTX 1080RAM 16GBThis game was ok before the start of february and installing update at the time the optimization was never great city was would jump from 80fps to all the way to 30fps and lock at 30fps and jump right back to 60fps and above randomly in was worst on the upper part of the map of the game the moment I move my camera to the direction of the mountains or anything with grass the fps would stay below 50 I lowered the graphics still made no diffrence Rockstar fix.
0;I remember when this game was good. I could fly around as Iron Man freezing time at will while I watched the Incredible Hulk jump around causing devastation before getting bored and flooding the entire city.That was back when this game was good.Now that modding has been essentially disabled this game is unsupported years old single player and grindy multiplayer. I wish I could refund.Take Two? Go f yourselves.
0;A once fun game utterly ruined by hackers and exploiters thats coupled with one of the most toxic player bases outside of the Call Of Duty franchise.Unless you're looking for a dedicated frustration simulator where every mission heist and even open play is just dealing with people using hacks to ruin your gamign experience stay away
0;Unfortunately single player mods have been ruined byt the game developers which greatly reduces the appeal of this title. MODS in GTA have always been the backbone of these titles especially since the online HEAVILY pushes real world payments to make any progress. Look elsewhere GTA V has been put out to pasture. Lets hope RDR does not get the same treatment. Not recomended at all.
0;Used to be a great game. I bought a second copy on the PC specifically because I could mod it as Rockstar and Take Two openly supported the mod community even if they never released a modkit for it. Now years after release they decide modding is illegal removing every reason I have for owning this game. Take Two's mentality is going to be the death of PC gaming.
0;"""RIP 2 and a half years / 1800 hours of game time. Nice to know even thought you play in solo public sessions most of the time and never had a modder drop a single dollar on me you can still get your character deleted """"Just because"""". Looks like it's time to check out all those single player mods i see so much about till i get bored and remove this massive HDD space hog."""
0;"""I have played this game for more than 100 hours and had a lot of fun playing while i could. Rockstar decided to permenantly ban me for no reason and wont let me appeal it. They also wont tell me why I was banned because it is """"classified"""" info. Thanks rockstar you"""
0;Seeing as I just I got randomly tempbanned from the Online mode *for the second time* and *again* without getting any explanation for the reasoning behind it...This would be a bloody awesome game especially the online mode if it was run by people who actually give a damn about their customers.Potential for 9/10 if it were from a better company. Downgraded to 2/10 since it's by Rockstar. Please do not give these people a single cent of your money.
0;community braindead idiots who just killing you who cant help in missions they can only shoot and shoot. game company rockstar fckin idiots banning for no reason and they servers are broken when i can't play gta online for 3 day's. BAN OPRESSOR MK2 BCS PLAYERS ONLY KILLING ANOTHER PLAYERS WITH THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Neverhave I installed a mod in GTA V. However that's in large part because I played very little of GTA online after finishing the single player story and the total lack of single player DLC content. The fact that the devs and/or publishers of the game would go after fans trying to add value to their game free of charge is despicable
0;you rockstar give us our mods back. stop being about people modding having to re buy the game because you felt like having fun with the game and downloaded some mods is a complete scam. more than half your fan base hates you now and the other half are happily craddling your in their hand and abusing the reoport option. take 2.
0;OpenIV was a tool that breathed new life into the singleplayer of this game and kept me playing far longer than I would have without it. Its operated for over 10 years and now all of a sudden its a bad thing according to Take Two. Get the sticks out of your asses Take Two and stop shooting yourself in the foot and spitting in the face of this once great game's (formerly) thriving modding community.
0;Great story well made game play for the single player. Online forced pvp cluster is absolute t that stops you from enjoying the game as every 2 steps some tries to kill you for no ing reason. NEEDS SINGLE PLAYER SANDBOX not the wristflicking wanksock pvp t.
0;Great game. for the story mode that is. but i dont suggest you play online. if you are dirt poor and dont spend your real life money on shark cards to become rich then i promise you that anybody and everybody will try their hardest to make sure you stay poor and have the worst play possible. 10/10 singleplayer. 100 multyplayer
0;I was on the fence before. I'm not much of an online player and I thought the story was a bit short and non online content was lacking.With the persecution of the modding community by Take Two Interactive GTAV has been rendered into a decent campaign with 0 replay ability.
0;I only bought this game with the prospect of installing singleplayer mods made by the amazing GTA modding community. The majority of my enjoyment from this game has been from playing free singleplayer mods. I guess Take Two can't stand it when their customers find additional enjoyment from their game for free. Take away modding and there's not much incentive to purchase their games in the future.
0;As a user who purchased Grand Theft Auto V almost exclusively because of it's modded content I'm deeply saddened and disappointed by the lack of support provided to the modding community. I don't usually write reviews but in this instance I'm inclined to voice my anger against the recent actions taken against the OpenIV team. Their contributions to Grand Thef Auto V will be surely missed.
0;I own all GTA games on PC and I've been playing them since I was akid (I know I'm not supposed to &gt ) but it hurts to see TakeTwo go after modding. One of the most fun thigs about the game now being taken away? I can't reccomend GTA V at the moment especially with GTA Online being such a cash grab.
0;EDIT Ayyy! OpenIV is back! Leaving this as a negative review as Take Two still have done nothing but harrass modders and that is not okay.Great game. Amazing SP. Multiplayer is w/ microtransactions. Negative review because Take Two are money hungry s that would rather ban a community of modders than build one.THAT IS NOT OKAY. Take some notes from Bethesda guys
0;This was a great game now Rockstar has abandoned the community for modders/exploiters while they continue to milk the game for money. Also all recent DLC has been nothing buy Pay To Win greifing tools that take hundred of hours to grind out...Unless you have your mom's credit card.It's extremely tempting but don't buy this game unless you want to play single player which rockstar has also abandoned or Rockstar fixes their game.
0;The best thing about this game is the modding community which the devs keep blocking its one thing to ban players who use mods from the default game its quite another to force modders to use the default platform (by shutting down modding communities) then ban them for using mods
0;I really can't recommend this game at all.It's too grindy for some buys even more than Free2Play GamesThe Servers are horrible.The Loading screens are endless.EDIT In 3 Sessions I had 5 hackersThe community is the biggest pile i have ever seen in a game.EDIT 2018 Still grindy the most grindiest game i have ever seen.
0;The story is the greatest ever in a video game. The gameplay is really really fun and if you install mods it's definitly the best game I have ever played. The online mode however is broken and ruined by the greed of take two and rockstar the chat is censored beyond belief everything is too expensive its basically pay to win. I like the game for the mods online is a ing grinding mess which is why I don't reccomend the game
0;Begging for money isn't cool alone but wiping out an entire community in the process is just ****** up. Modding helps a game but in this case its going to destroy reputation because of all the B.S. the companies have done just to get people to buy more of their crap rather than allowing some of it along with a load of new stuff get modded in.
0;I have played a lot on this game but I can say that I have lost all my faith in it and I will be leaving it. This game has become nothing but a grindfest for ridiculously overpriced features that Rockstar has decided to double down on through the sale of Shark Cards now that they've taken steps to eliminate modding altogether including the Single Player they no longer support. It is clear Rockstar is only interested in Rockstar. Not their community.
0;Devs have killed modding there has not been a content update for the singleplayer since release and all of the GTA online events are re skinned versions of the same thing (steal supplies then sell a product). Good example of a game starting out great and ending worse than when it started. I don't recomment buying it at this point.
0;SHARK CARDS SHARK CARDS SHARK CARDS SHARK CARDS SHARK CARDS If you don't want to grind for countless hours or pay ridiculous sums of cash for re skinned cars don't support this game. R* and Take 2 continue to show just how greedy they are by trying to shut down offline modding community. Take 2 can pound sand they will never get another dollar from me.
0;Why would you take the fun out of GTA Singleplayer by killing of the modding scene! I've stuck around with this game for so long now buying into the micro transactions for online but THIS! What are you playing at Take Two and Rockstar! If you're into modding and GTA well modding is now OVER!
0;This was good until the online part came with Peer to peer banning innocent player and Take2 banning mods for a singleplayer game that has never recived a DLC for 5 years to make them go to online and force MTA down their throat.On behaf of the foundation of PC games. this is unacceptable
0;Take Two you have really screwed yourself and your community over. I love this game well and truely but your recent actions especially against OpenIV have destroyed our opinion of you. Fix this. I encourage all users whether active or not to leave a bad review we cannot let Take Two do this.
0;DO NOT support Take Two's greedy malicious and ignorant choice to go after mods that are a huge selling point for PC versions of games. Much love for Rockstar but GTA Online made hundreds of millions of dollars last year and Take Two is going after individuals who have supported this and undoubtedly contributed to the game's sales numbers. And shark cards
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this! you
0;I love Rockstar and I love this game. I've had hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun across the Steam and Social club versions of this game and I still enjoy playing. But I can't support Take Two after they essentially banned modding in GTA singleplayer.
0;see ya Invincible Franklin (Update modding is back but the dmg is done. online toon that I transfered over from my old xbox when I made the switch to the master race has been.. how do i say this... re set? not sure why... modded the game once for single player. fun times.(franklin was basically the hulk) guess not anymore. Plus this game aint worth $59.99. In fact it honestly was never worth that. cant belive i own two copies of this. dayum
0;More than 150 hr and I can say this game is NOT about having fun this game is about paying more actual money To be honest It's enjoyable at first if you have freinds to play withBut when you want to buy something It feels like working more than playing you do some stuff over and over just to buy something is't that usefull and crazy expensive
0;The major reason why i played the game was because of single player and mods now that thats gone theres no reason for me to play anymore! Im not gonna start playing online and pay sharkcards for a game that i already payed 40 pounds for! you Take 2 you greedy s!
0;Take Two Interactive has taken away modding which adds so much much replayability to single player. Don't buy this game or Shark Cards Until they learn there lesson. Modding keeps games alive look at skyrim and how much life that game has and it came out in 2011.
0;The recent change by Take Two that kills modding essentially kills some of the best parts of this game. Custom vehicles police cars updated textures all of this is killed by their decision.This is the primary reason to buy GTAV today and what makes it such a great platform for content creators to do some amazing things. They have killed an entire community and should not be supported for doing so.
0;"""You need to seriously reconsider where you are heading as a company before I will ever purchase from you again. What people do with their own game should be up to them and the idea of banning people permanently from the most up to date part of the game is laughable when they have bought the game. If you don't want people to modify game files or to """"cheat"""" then don't make it such a grind to get certain items when the point of the game is supposed to be fun not work."""
0;OpenIV vs T2. Thats the only reason I'm leaving a negative review. GTA is an amazing game but Take Two has completely f*cked over the playerbase by not allowing SP mods and by being greedy money hungry developers. I seriously doubt R* or T2 will ever have another game as successful as GTA V because at this point ALOT of people have given up on these developers.Sign the petition to bring back OpenIV and unf*ck this situation https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;"""Players who are hacking in online to troll others roam free. They don't care about players the term """"Player experienc in online"""" is equivalent to """"if you hack money we lose money so don't care about other things"""". You took a huge mistake in gaming industry Rockstar maybe changing your team may help you."""
0;Game feels so much like a grind and all the fun stuff is so overpriced. the shark cards are also overpriced. i mean 100 dollars for 8 million? almost everything good costs at least 1 2 million so thats what 4 8 things only and then you are back to grinding. what makes this worse is that i am grinding hard for money and see some modder randomly trolling around and he got all the money without any grind. thats another thing hackers HACKERS EVERYWHERE
0;I really enjoyed the single player experience of GTA V and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone who enjoys massive open world masterpieces. However the multiplayer is a repetitive microtransaction laden hellhole comparable to free to play mobile games (while still costing $60) and Take Two declared war on mods so I'm going to go ahead and give a negative though I might change it if the company bends over backward to make up for it.
0;single player is fun but the multiplayer has too many hackers on it and rockstar is too lazy to do anything about it id recommend to buy it for the single player but not the multiplayer you spend 40 dollars for money and in game but you can buy cash drops from people for like 5 or 10 dollars for 10 million or more for example it just ruins the game. but besides all the hackers and cheaters its a great game cant go wrong with gta.
0;When Rockstar and Take Two learn to let go of their endless greed I will adjust my review.Don't buy the game now simply running it will void their EULA which earns you a permanent ban. There is such talent in the studio but it's constantly being bottlenecked by endless bad desicions. I kind of like the game but utterly despise what the studio has become please Rockstar be awesome again like you used to be...
0;I only play this for single player and mods have extended that. Given Rockstar are putting no effort into the single player game we need mods.This is another example of the 1% tryingt to fleece the 99%Rockstar you could do no wrong but now you've turned your fans against you.
0;Destroying the modding scene on a game that so many people bought this game for the second or even third time Just to mod.. Brilliant idea Take Two clearly you and EA are having some sort of p***ing contest over who can be the most idiotic concerning their fanbases and franchises. Congrats you're now in the lead.
0;Take two (owns rockstar) RUINED the online experience by ruining the game economy. I shouldnt have to spend an extra $100 on top of a $60 game to enjoy only very little of the online content. This isnt CSGO where youre only paying for skins. For gta its pay to play then you just pay and pay moreTLDR unless you're bill gates dont buy this
0;Take Two will gut you for microtransactions online and will essentially lockout over half of the online content unless you shell out a ridiculous sum of money. Singleplayer was okay but now you can't even customize your own experience because Take Two again have no clue how to deal with the modding community.
0;I don't even make mods and have never installed a mod but with the recent happenings i think take 2 are actually ing . But not Rockstar though. After having played this game for several hundred hours on pc i think it's a great game. Both online and the offline storymode. Rockstar make great games and have always given spotlight to good mods. But take 2 can go themselves.
0;There's nothing much to be said except that yet another great game/series is being destroyed through monetizing every possible aspect of the game. It started with launch day DLC early access its moved to microtransactions and now the guys over at Take Two jerking each other off came up with the brilliant idea just as they climax onto each other they need to push more people to GTA Online by removing ANY modding on the game.No wonder why piracy has become so popular.
0;no mods for single player no good reviewssingle player dosent affect anyone other than myself and other people who chose tho mod their game removing them makes no senseyou dont make content for people who cant play online all the time so other people started making it for you but you cant make money off that now can you?i hope you change your disision before people decide to boycot your next game.
0;upping the price to 80 usd right before sales.... what a move R*other than that a good game but just wtf .. ../ /) .. ( / .// .. . ../ .// . . ../ / ./ ../ . .././ / ./ ./. _ _ . . . . ..(.( .( .( ./.)..)..(..(. .) .) .).). . / / . . .. / ./.. .. / .. .. / . ..( . ..) ./
0;TT's banning of GTAV mods makes me think I should refund this game. It's not like I'm going to play it anymore I don't like the multiplayer. Theres nothing wrong with it I just don't like it. And so I only played the singleplayer. Since TT isn't going to release and DLC they actually scrapped what was planned for SP why would I want to keep playing? Shocking Conduct. OpenIV's well within fair use I'd I had enough cash I'd pay for the laywers to fight TT.
0;Product received for free. I find it very unfortunate that I have to wright a negative review for such a wionderful game. After what has gone on with T2 OPENIV and R* I willl never support this game again until OPENIV returns or some other reasonable solution is reached. Thanks to you guys you have ruined my GTA5 experience.
0;The game is great 10/10 it is fun and competitive all in one but gta 5 has the worst servers and anti cheat system on the entire internet i for one have been banned from this game months of grinding wiped out in one hit 500 headshot for a skull tatto is no easy task and i didnt even cheat i dont know how to.Buy this game knowing that some day you will lose all your achievments and have your character reset and you will also not have a voice to content that decision buyer beware.
0;Hackers are not nearly as bad as made out to be but it would be nice if you didn't get banned for having hackers in the same lobby as you when the lobby is scanned. Rockstar used to be a cool hip comany now all they are are a bunch of corporate cu. nts. All they want is kids with their mom's credit card to buy $1000s worth of shark cards.
0;it's fine. i didn't really have an active role in offline society anyway.edit best ban appeal simulator. 10/10 on this aspect.PS single player was still worth it until you ran out of missions.and i really hate that multiplayer features and some vehicles are not available in single player.on a side note once you get banned (and you Will get banned) you can then mod the game to your heart's content!
0;Do you have real life money for sharkcards? do you have modded money? great good for you because then youre able to have fun and buy things in this game.But if you dont then this game wont be fun at all because its simply pay to win it take way too long to grind money in this game.
0;its ok but its a massivly pay to do anything on multi player unless you allready have certian thingsthere support team is a load of crap and there ban system is broken and baned my becuse my game glyched then i think it baned me becuse a background program crashed and tryed to take the screen from the game but thay wont tell me why
0;The only reason most people bought the game is for modding and now they have destroyed that community that added so much creativity and are forcing people towards their microtransaction shark cards to get anything good even though GTAV is one of the top most selling games ever. OpenIV didnt even work in online mode ffs it was singleplayer! but no some rich want a bit more cash so they over an entire creative platform. This needs to be taken out of the game right now
0;Microtransactions should never of been part of AAA game. The Online of this game was completely ruined and now they have decided to destroy the single player modding community which is you know the main reason any PC user bought this game to start with.
0;Its a good game but unfortunately there are so many modders that rockstar didnt handle. also today i got banned for being a legit player. I never use any hacks or cheats i spent 1.019 hours playing gta online working all the heists to buy any vehicles i want and this is what i get from being a legit player. I got banned for 1 month and my lv 310 character will be reset. How terrible you are rockstar!!
0;If you're waiting to buy this game for modding all i can say its too late now Take two Rockstar's parent company has pretty much made it impossible to mod the game by issuing a cease &amp desist to the team behind OpenIV causing them to shut down the modding tool.
0;F*CK ROCKSTAR F*CK TAKE TWO!!! YOU F*CKED UP BIG TIME!!!i bought this game on pc for mainly mods because its amazing and fun and extends my interest in the game! i even have this on ps4goodluck getting customers on pc. might aswell be a console game now *middle finger*
0;If you're looking to mod the game instead of spending tons of real cash on online items all I can say is good luck. The Publisher take 2 sent a cease and desist to open IV RIPEdit Open IV is back. This review is still negative because I still think that what they did wasn't right to do in the first place.
0;I originally bought GTA V for XBOX 360. When it came out for PS4 I bought it for that too. Finally when it came out for PC I purchased it again. The campaign is great but can only be replayed so many times. The only reason I continue to play GTA V is for the awesome mods built by the community. Take Two trying to shutdown these mods has made me regret my purchases. On behalf of OpenIV screw you Take Two.
0;Its a fun game untill i got in a lobby where there was a modder who killed us all ed up our gameplay and what do u know after a week im getting suspended for no ing reason yeah i spent money i tried to play as honestly as i could and what rockstar just all over my work well thats one awsome game
0;"""Worked fine since release for me. Try to play the last few days and """"gta V has unexpectedly exited"""" over and over. Tried every fix in the book and nothing. Guess thats it for me. Never even bothered with online because it's such a mess. Just want to play some single player but nope."""
0;GTA Online is essentially a laundry list of you cant do unless you buy ingame money with real life money unless you want to devote your time to loading screens and making small chunks of money at a time to then buy stuff which will allow you to make slightly less small sums of money and so on.
0;TakeTwo/Rockstar are actively trying to stop SinglePlayer modding because they want YOU to play GTA Online and buy sharkcards.This wasn't always the case but sadly this game became a grindfest. Unless you want to spend evening after evening grinding mission to be able to buy a single (new) car then this game is not for you!
0;Single player is amazing. Multiplayer once was. Instead of repairing the broken GTA Online they are taking further actions to constrain freedom of players destroying the modding community. I guess the reason they want it gone is because modders can provide what Rockstar themselves cannot (like good customer support interesting missions money the list goes on)... I am joining the negative review flush as although I sincerely enjoy GTA V and do respect Rockstar Games what they are doing is wrong.
0;game is no mods multiplayer very bad full of loading screens less gameplay than waiting game crashes cause of the loading screens cant play multiplayer if you dont have a crew cause everybody is constantly leaving lobys...GAME IS NOT WORTHY OF PLAYING!!!!!
0;Since OpenIV is the primary reason many people still play this game you just shot yourself in the foot. I hope TakeTwo rethinks this decision on their biggest money maker.I hope I can continue playing this game the way the community wants to but if TT decides that people having fun and still buying their game is not as important as their microtransactions let alone they are probably not even affected AT ALL by this I can positively say that I will move on to a different game.
0;Great game for modding! I do enjoy LSPDFR. It made my depression and self hate go away. But now thanks to Take Two crapping on OpenIV and crapping on my life I now have to see my therapist again. I never liked my therapist... My medical doesn't cover it so I have to pay out of pocket. Now that I am in financial hardship again my children and pets won't be able to eat. I'm sorry God I tried.
0;you rockstar ing get a real anti cheat ffs everytime i join a ing lobby it's just modders every ingwhere and the game is so ing laggy i can't even play with my friends in a public lobby because everyone is just ing flying and teleporting around because you are not capable of making a ing multiplayer game with more than 4 players this game is gayy ing homos s noobs 1v1 me csgo ing noobs go back to tetris u noobs fckn s!!!!
0;Modding is a key reason I play on a computer it enhances the experience and is a great way for the community to contribute to an amazing game.GTA V is a game that is great on it's own and becomes infinitely better with mods similar to Skyrim. Instead of praising the mod authors for creating revenue for the game they sued them. Boo.
0;Singleplayer modding was the main reason I bought this. The multiplayer was a decent bonus until I realized just how money grubbing it is. Now that Take Two are taking down the main mod that other mods use it isnt fun and furthur shows Take Two's intention for no single player content and to squeeze more money from players of the online.
0;Instead of focusing on fixing multiplayer breaking hacking Rockstar (being forced by parent publisher Take Two) decided to ban single player game modifications.. I don't recommend purchasing this game. If you look at the longevity of any single player game that is getting up in the years the modding community is what keeps it alive. This game is dead. GTAV is dead. Hopefully Rockstar isn't dead but I won't be picking up any of their games on launch anymore.
0;A great game at launch in 2013... today it s f*ckin money machine! Firstly you pay for a single playing but if you wanna play GTA online(normally) you should( MUST) donate everytime or download cheat! P.S.I was blocked for using cheats(not to ruin the game for other players but for in game things cars clothes weapons etc) and I don t regret.
0;They are trying to kill the modding in single player like a bunch of asses. The multiplayer is utter crap and its just a way for Rockstar and 2K to rake it cash hand over foot with microtransactions because you can not make enough money to buy the newest stuff without buying shark cards
0;"""Take 2 have killed modding. It's a computer game. Modding is 90% of why people bought it. They are pushing people to their online where they have """"microtransactions"""". This is the 3rd best selling game of all time they don't need the money from microtransactions. They are ruining single player to force people to pay them even more money. Will not be playing another Take 2 game unless this is resolved."""
0;Take Two is such a money they would propably sell you their mom. Everything in this game is overpriced so you basically have to buy sharkcards for gta online. And if you want to play a mod even in singleplayer they dont let you do that because the mod makers get instantly sued because they take their sales down. Take Two
0;THis games enemies are so unbalanced if the enemies are not even a level above you they can get you down to no health with one bullet and you cant actually pause the game it keeps going no mater what and the cover system is complete and udder trash you cant get out of cover in time and a melee guy rushes you out of no where and bam you are dead
0;Never even buy this. Rockstar. No more mods. You have to buy shark cards to have some fun in online. every time a new update comes the cheapest thing is worth a few million which is 2 full days worth of grinding heists. This game turned to Utter ing cancer
0;I can not beleive that Take Two Interactive/Rockstar Games has issued a cease and desist for the user created modding API that allowes so many people to create new and creative material to be added to the game. This is insane. Modding is a part of gaming. We bought the game lets us mod it. Ban us from your servers if you want let us mod copy of the game we BOUGHT from you.
0;online is more broken then world of warcraft right nowan absolute show every game a modder turns you in a guitar and you have to restart the game so they actually manage to mess up your system files............. if they dont do that they will blow you up or anoy you otherwise.sometimes the modders drop money but rockstar will take that from you in a instant but yet you meet a hacker next game.game of the year my
0;I really enjoyed the game when it first came out. Enjoyed it more when mods began to get released. But after the decision of banning mods I have lost all interest in this game and any future 2k and rockstar gamesRIP OpeneIV you did a great job making mods while it lasted.
0;"""Started GTA Online with friends. Played for 7 days non stop to buy a $800 000 car and a $15 000 motorcycle. Both magically disappeared from my garage. Rockstar acknowledged there was an issue but refused to bring back the vhicles. As GTA would say """"Wasted""""."""
0;Since I already gave these greedy bastards my money this is about all I can do to let them know how much I disagree with their decisions regarding the fantastic modding communities surrounding this game.**** you Take Two. Don't expect my support for future games you publish
0;Was a good game until they started basically forcing you to buy microtransactions(shark cards). Everything costs so much money and takes forever to get a decent amount of money in game. Also the recent OpenIV mod shutdown by Take Two is just rediculous. Will make you think a little more on buying the next GTA game.
0;yupthats good.Edit they removed my character in order to fix a bug from rank 200 they gave me 157 removing my character lead to removing everything that i owned before now i dont even own a home and have 35millions on hand where before i had 120millions in vehicles and properties. Rockstar support trash.
0;Maybe if Rockstar would Take Two seconds to think before doing something stupid like C&amp D'ing one of the community's most popular (and completely legal!) tools they wouldn't deal with all the backlash that will no doubt increase in the next few days.
0;No new single player content since release.Pay to win online Take Two Interactive (the cancerous punlishers) filed a cease and desist against OpenIV the major modding tool for this game and other GTA games.Sank so many hours into this game despite the modders and no real way to make money in free roam and then was perma banned for using a mod menu in private/solo lobbies (because the anti cheat doesn't know the difference between private and open lobbies).
0;GTA Online is by far the worst it has ever been constant lag hackers loading for 5 or 10 min. If only Rockstar would allow us to host our own online sessions like in GTA IV then most of these problems would be gone. But seeing this game has been out for quite awhile it seems that there is little hope to fix these issues.
0;"""This is the Review for GTA online only 70% of gaming times are loading screen After loading 95% are timeout section / unknown network error Other games' network works fine except this """"good"""" gameAlthough the gameplay is decent but you spend me 70% of time just for finding a game section?HELL NO!"""
0;Take 2 is a dirty C(U)NT that needs more money. Stop feeding the smelly C(U)NT Do not buy this game or you'll grow hair on your palms! #Take2Sux Take2 is the sucker of diseased C(O)CKS. They smell like Swiss cheese and want you to purchase microtransactions so they can bleach their dirty A(SS)HOLES and make you sniff it afterwards.
0;If you like to mod this is the game for you online you can take money of people kill them in god mode appear in lobbys with you s*** over rated stats hastle people better than you and show off your modding skill by getting people banned by giving them money drops they don't want kick them out lobbys blow them up in some p****y way and pat your self on the back for being the modder every gamer hates and join the great hall of c**ts you know you all are
0;To be honest I still play this game... alot. But if you're completely new never had it on xbox or ps I would not recommend buying this game the community is cancer but I can deal with that but in the online mode everything is so expensive it's easier to get money via microtransactions that it is in game missions. I still had all my money from my playstation account so It wasn't that bad on here. but it is not worth it to buy if you did not have it on ps or xbox..
0;Ban Unban BanLegit player caught in the crosshairs of Rockstar much like thousands of other players. It would be nice to get some kind of an update from Rockstar. The recent DLC mess has caused a massive wipe of tons of players accounts. If your thinking of playing GTA Online you do so at your own risk until they sort out this mess it's just not safe.
0;I was going to be positive but take two has royallly f*cked it over doing this on behalf of people like me who bought this version to have fun in singleplayer with mods this is my second version of the game i got it on last gen and here now i cant play lspdfr or use a ferrari or new jets. Thanks you little f*ckers you screwed it up
0;"""got new PCfreshly Re download the game.wanted to try online.""""cant go online with altered game""""wtf.jpg.find solution.go online. solo session. pretty fun.managed to get up rank 6. will play tomorrow.got message. banned a month and everything resetted.whattheactualfk.jpgonly want to play the single player lad?just crack it. online full of hacker and BS world record.this game only fun at the day it was launched."""
0;Not only has the single player for this game been completely abandoned with many of the online vehicles and weapons not even appearing in single player Take Two have now decided to try and put an end to single player modding. You wanted force payers to move over to multiplayer so they have to spend even more money to afford in game content that is ludicrously overpriced. This game is dead to me as long as Take Two continues to be greedy and unethical.
0;I gave up on multiplayer long ago that was a lost cause as they jacked up the prices on everything and made it more difficult to make money. I used single player for a laugh just to have a bit of a sandbox mode with mods. Thats now going. Cheers take two! This is your own doing.
0;Enjoyed the game for a little bit when i installed a vehicle handling mod since rockstars default settings are a pathetic joke. Rockstar however has started pushing around everyone with their influence and are trying to micromanage how i handle the game i bought for personal use on my computer. This game and all other products from this stupid company will not be bought by me anymore if they continue behaving like animalistic
0;Too grindy garbage you spend 30 minutes playing a mission only to get minimal rewards which doesn't get you much. You'd have to grind hours just to buy a simple vehicle or whatever. This by doing the same boring missions over and over because they're the most efficient.
0;I have played more than a month's worth of this game and in that time the creators have done nothing but show absolute contempt for all of their customers. Treat us with respect and we might consider giving you our patronage again but you will never have our trust.
0;The developer profited lot of money and keep a poor technology infrastructure. Many bugs and connections problems in different game actions.Of course thousands of cheaters and disonest kids.I only bought the game with skins profits a free game I can consider.
0;this game is honestly a ing pile of complete dog and cow this game deserves 100000000000 out 5 stars this game does not deserve to be on PC shark cards are over priced by a mile (just as far as the ceo of rockstar virginety) just reminder that this game and its makers are complete cow and studpid af dont respect them. because they dont respect anyone else.
0;Blame TAKE TWO for this. The lawyers needed to itch their C&amp D fingers after taking out free alternatives to GTA O they needed their FIX once again. SHAME on you T2. Remember how you supported mods? Boy how T2 changed when the SHARK CARD AIDS arrived.
0;I bought the PC version after already owning the Xbox version of this game specifically to mod singleplayer. Take Two removing this ability is a huge slap in the face to PC gamers. Listen if Take Two just wants to focus on multiplayer and ignore singleplayer... that sucks but fine whatever. But then at least let us create our own singleplayer content since you won't.
0;This game is good but RockStar and Take Two wants your money and don t give a about community. We are for them after big sales with GTA V on pc they still don t want release RD on pc and now this ers ban modding. Yeah for real now is modding illegal in GTA V. Why? Because R* and Take Two says you. But now community says go off R* and Take Two they making good games but thats all good in this society EA and Ubisoft are such better than these .
0;So basically mods are allowed again through the openIV framework. Doesn't change what they tried to do regardless. Their actions are so shortsighted and all the actions before have hinted at pure greed.I'm sorry but I won't be changing my review to a positive one. This isn't the first incident this publisher/developer behaviour should be punished.
0;"""sorry i thought this was Grand Theft Auto. remove this bull**** system """"Bad Sport"""" ROCKSTAR. i cant even play with my friends. this is GTA not a FLUFFY BUNNY ADVENTURE we want to kill each other blowing up cars and sh*t not to """"heyy kids we are going to adventure let's go to Mount Chiliad yeayyyyyyy"""". fuc king piece of system"""
0;"""OpenIV a pleasant little thing thats helped breathe new life into the GTA fanchise for quite a few years shot down by a C&amp D order essentially wounding if not killing the modding community and the massive amount of enjoyable content thats been created and shared over the years.Good job Take Two keep up the """"good"""" work I'm sure your customers appreciate your desire to stifle creativity."""
0;Take a game series that had it's best moments from the singleplayer expierence now put an online mode that offers in game currency and screw over people who just want to play singleplayer with mods.Screw Take Two and shame on Rockstar for not putting their foot down.
0;Glad I wasted my money on this now. Thanks Take 2. Sorry not everyone has the heaps of money to pay all of your microtransactions in online but punishing the singlplayer modding community who is against tampering with the online functions is not the answer. Only reason I bought a third copy of the game a couple years ago is to mod the singlplayer. Guess now I've lost that $60.
0;Online has been pay to win since day oneSingleplayer just got shot in the knee by Take Two by killing the only thing giving the singleplayer post game contentEven if the people who sell the games take 50% thats still over 2 BILLION dollars that take two have made on GTA Vbut apparently thats not enough
0;Terrible online story medicre. Only good thing was mods now thats gone. RIP GTA. Never giving a single penny of my money to Take Two and I will be uninstalling the game if they fail to fix this. Well done for ing over the PC player base mods were the only good thing about this game on PC. Dont waste your money. Dont waste your time. Dont give money to these bastards.
0;I once would have given this game 4 stars but only because I bought it for the modding. Now it seems Take Two Interactive is worried that singleplayer mods pose a threat to their revenue in GTA Online. Without the modding community this game will fade into the background and die. To me without the modding this game would only receive 2 stars from me. I will be boycotting TTI games in the future. If TTI doesn't support 100% of the GTA community then we shouldn't support their business.
0;Rockstar is incredibly greedy and refuses to actually let players get money for a resonable amount of time spent playing. All they want you to do is buy their stupid shark cards. They say it is to help get dlc for people but the game is still being bought for 60 dollars a piece. They also refuse to work against the hacking situation. Absolutly devs with no respect for the community or for that community's money.
0;Product received for free. Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;GTA O is the biggest cash grab I've seen in a AAA title like this ever. A freaking vehicle costs the eqivalent of $49.99 worth of ingame currency. The biggest hope you had to have any real fun in GTA O would be if a modder gave you billions of dollars for free but Take Two Interactive now bans people even if they didnt do any modding themselves. Spend your money elsewhere.
0;I used to LOVE GTAV id play it every night for hours.That was until they made it pay to win. you can lose money in the blink of an eye. Its all the ing time that I get chased but a 13 year old kid with a flying motorcycle with a jet and ing rockets. whos idea was it to put OP vehicles that can destroy you in a second.What the are you doing Rockstar?
0;Absolutely loved GTAV when it came out one of the first PC games I ever bought! However due to recent events against modding I can no longer play the game. Shame that such a massive part of gaming is coming to an end. Take Two get your act together. Sincerely a disgruntled OpenIV user.
0;Reasons why I don't recommend this game 1) Hackers teleporting the entire server and instakilling you.2) Hackers dropping cash on you and then you get permabanned because it continuously happens.3) Copy/Pasted content is the new norm for DLC.4) Public lobbies suck because there are so many s constantly on a rampage.5) Can't do anything in a private lobby because that would mean you can actually do open world content and R* doesn't want that.
0;sad that take two is against single player modding. i've buyed gta first for the xbox 360 (the too expansife special edition)then when the next gen version came i bought it for ps4 now i have it on pc for single player modding just to have fun but apparentely they dont want me too have fun. and that after buying gta ing 3 times. if there will come a new gta ever. i wont buy it anymore.
0;Well the game itself is great fun the BIG problem is the multiplayer. Minutes to connect (having fast internet+SSD doesn't help that much) and apparently getting your account suspended for no reason erasing over 200 hours of progress and leaving you with a lot of questions but not a single answer from the support. Quality Experience.EDIT 18/03/2018 My suspension got lifted (confirming the faulty anti cheat) and got my character back but the way i got treated was absolutely
0;Banned because of hackers gave money check. Broken grinding fest check. Auto machine answer instead of a real person who can understand what unfair treatment means check. But good game and story nonetheless the online is kinda messy at it state right now withou shark card you would have a hard time grinding to the point where you can enjoy which gives or take will take more than 1 month.
0;Don't get me wrong this game is fun but like other games you get bored of it at some time. With this we had mods mods that let us have fun in single player but now those mods are gone so no more extra fun. For the OpenIV team I love you guys and hopefully they undo this action.
0;They've killed off the modding scene after 10 years of it being around online is so expensive that it pretty much forces you to buy shark cards. Great campaign thoNot to mention the amount of hackers in the game that will teleport you all to one location and kill you all repeatedly thereby making your expensive vehicles etc worthless.
0;"""I love this game...but anything you love will be destroyed eventually...even tho I never used OpenIV I wanted to start to mod my SP after finishing it recently...""""OpenIV is makin it easier to hack n quot sure its not their fault...try to get the cheaters...they just toke the easy way out and still hackermen all around I"""
0;I've played hundreds of hours of this game but I can't recommend it with the direction it's going right now with gtao. Take two had effectively halted gta5 modding and not even the hacking that people abuse online just normal people who want to mess around in single player.
0;Take Two on behalf of the OpenIV team and all those people who spent their own personal time making single player content F you. If you focused on single player a bit instead of porting everything to Online for a micro transaction paradise maybe you'd have less issues.
0;We need to stop greedy publishers and developers from dictating our rights as consumers. We purchased the game. It is our property to do with as we please. Open IV never messed with GTA Online and Take 2 has no basis for doing this except out of a pursuit for absolute power and greed. Long lost are the times of valuing the consumer. We need to put and end to this type of asshattery.
0;Modding is a big part of the SINGLE PLAYER ELEMENT of this game. It causes no damage to their profit what so ever. i have got mods occationally on my singleplayer but it doesn't stop me from getting Shark Cards (which I now regret). Getting rid of modding is both unnecessary and stupid.
0;I paid for this game on pc to mod it now it's no different than crappy consols... why stop the modding?.. wait I know its because you want to push people into multiplayer so you can shove microtransactions down our throats... sorry we only gave you billions instead of trillions boo ing hoo Take 2 and Rockstar
0;Take two wants to kill modding so they can make more money on top of their already ludicrous profit off this game. I mean Jesus Christ this game is still $60 after 4 years that should be enough on its own to make you not want to buy it. take two for trying to eliminate single player modding
0;The OpenIV team has been the backbone of GTA modding for the last 10 years. We the GTA community and Modding community combined shouldn't let one cease and desist from Take Two Interactive ruin the efforts of enthusistic modders working purely from the passion that they have for the game. Let's take a stand against this greedy company 1. Refuse to purchase Shark Cards for GTA Online.2. Write your own review and leave a negative recommendation.3. Spread the message.#MakeGTAGreatAgain
0;In the support of Creative modding. Not cool Take Two and Rockstar. We do not aprove. Attacking the modders is not the right way to grow a stable and healthy comunity who will bring more people in to the fold. ''Modders mod because they love the game.'' Nerd Cubed
0;Why the would they add hacks directly into the game as a feature behind a paywall. You think we all enjoyed being 1 shot by modders with exploding bullets? Literal cancer. Flying motorcycles? Is this ing saints row? Modders used to be able to fly around in cars too it was ing obnoxious. Literal cancer. This game went from a solid 9.9/10 to 0/10 overnight. GG
0;I love the GTA franchise with all my heart. But Take Two is attacking the game's modding community and I will not stand for it. I play strictly vanilla GTA O but it is unacceptable for Take Two to attempt to shut down the modding community that brought us hilarious single player mods and RP servers. GTA V is a good game but don't buy it Take Two does not deserve your money.
0;On behalf of OpenIV.Screw off Rockstar and TakeTwo!You are literally the bane of fun.You fix glitches bugs CORE FEATURES (like the Titan's door opening) and remove mods that all have ZERO game breaking value to them but keep in the connectability strange errors and game breaking bugs and glitches. Go yourselves.
0;"""Banning modding in single player because you felt it could potentially impact the sales of your shark cards. After making billions of dollars selling the game itself and then billions more with microtransations you still hadn't had enough money from this three year old game. So what do you do? You ban all gta modding because it's """"illegal.""""Screw you Take Two."""
0;I've had every gta game since gta 3. This is the first time that I've seen a company publicly say screw you to the consumers. Everyone here bought the game for the same reason mods. If I wanted to play the boring story mode I would play this on my Xbox. Time to find a new game.
0;This game used to be quite entertaining but now it's just money grabbing by TakeTwo/R*. Honestly the only reason this game hasn't completely crashed and burned is because there's nothing really like it.It's possible to have fun messing around with your mates in a private lobby but otherwise it's absolute garbage.But hey at least you can go to the hood and chuck gas at everyone to 'cleanse' it 10/10 would gas again.
0;Before Take Two lets Open IV run again I will NOT be buying another Rockstar game. I was I very big supporter of the Gta franchise on primarily PC. I am no longer recomending any of Take Twos games. Take Two has lost the respect of there PC player base. Bring back Open IV.
0;you are gay banning modding and open iv you sir get a middle finger from every one who owns gta 5 you will see and you cant declare fair use of content illegal you suck modding is the only reason you got sales on this game cause it sucks balls without mods!
0;GTA V is the ultimate playground unfortunately multiplayer requires you to grind countless hours for everything (or pay with real money on top of game price). Modding scene brings a lot of fun back to the game (for example the role playing servers) but Take Two Interactive sees them as a threat and is actively trying to shut down any modding attempts (single and multiplayer).With that in mind I can't really recommend this game to anyone right now.
0;Why would they make modding illegal for a game whose main selling point is modding.Unless of course you're a mindless sheep with more money than sense who is willing to swap actual IRL currency for in game cash which will promptly be spent frivolously in a desperate bid to feel the incredible rush of both real and virtual buyer's remorse simultaneously.
0;"""Really ? Take Two you honestly Why are you ing people over that play single player yes there are modders on online but openIV has nothing to do with it like Fail Race said it's like you typed in to google """"GTA 5 MODS"""" and ed the biggest one you could find Here From NerdCubed ."""
0;Like many other people have said Take Two cant handle real player choice and shut down openiv (mods for single player only). Until they start actually caring about what the community wants to do there is no reason to buy this. Go with something that actually cares about having a good time and not about making yet another dollar.
0;"""You shouldn't buy this game if you want to have a """"good"""" experience online. This is T2's cash cow and they're milking every single drop of the the Shark Cards money and they make the game super unbalanced just for the Shark Cards by adding the Rocket Bike and tons of other Gunrunning crap. Every DLC cost about 30mil and they sell 8mil GTA money Shark Cards for 100$."""
0;Completely unnecessary decision to ban OpenIV shows that you don't care about your players. It allows players freedom and was the only reason I played your game be sure that I won't be buying any other games made by such a selfish developer. You're basically EA.
0;Online is a huge mess and the devs care more about their paid shark cards than the actual gameplay now they are banning mods which was the only thing keeping this game alive for me.Take Two does not respect the GTA V community or their customers. Do not award them your hard earned money for their terrible support and middle finger to the customer.
0;My first review for a game ever. Unfortunate it had to be this way but T2 R* parent company pretty much shut down the modding community. As fun as the game was I really can't recommend it to anyone anymore. The online aspect of the game isn't that fun. It's the single player mods that kept me interested.
0;Loved the game and developers until they decided to shut down modding. Figures as soon as I start doing it it goes away. I never wanted to try it because I was afraid of breaking something but adding mods to SP Is far in the most enjoying thing about this game for me know. I am leaving to negative review so they bring back openIV.
0;During 423hours playing GTA OL I have totally been a single player due to poor computer. Even have never used VPN.I make my own money 1 Dollar affter another 1 in one mission after another.And today I got suddenly banned for 1 month for no reason when I was in a Rob Mission.It got me quite confused what happened to you Rockstar? You have truely hurt my feelings
0;About this game just one. Online mod is very bad. Because new trand is that random banned ppls. And support reaction answer is ? Nothing ... their solution is absurd because they do not solve it or even look at the links and the dots. So this game pulls you money and then bans you. Super system and super game. And the people who make the brothel with the mod menu there can do what they want. They just poison the people around and they are going through them
0;Single player is great fun. Online was great with freinds until we realised you need to throw money into the game to progress and have fun. Having thrown money into the game we were all appauled at the amount of cheating and hacking in the game. Completely ruins it for everyone.
0;I will start by saying I like this games. GTAV is a good game. If you are looking for a good single player game I would pick this game up on sale. But if you are looking for a good modding or multiplayer experience DO NOT buy this game. Rockstar and there parent company are banning modders. As for the multiplayer all of the fun vehicles are behind huge paywalls that you either need to grind for dozens of hours or spend hundreds of dollars to get all of the vehicles you want.
0;Get Killed By People Who Are a Higher Level Than You Simulator 2013Edit Microtransactions up to $100 for $8000000 in game(which gets you NOTHING anymore). Please stop buying this game(which is full price still after 4 years) and supporting such a disgusting preditory marketing strategy.
0;Until Rockstar allows modding to remain active I can no longer support this game. I have hundreds of hours logged and I would love to keep playing and modding so my experience can continue to grow but all Rockstar cares about is more microtransactions from their poorly made GTA O.DO NOT BUY.
0;It used to be great. Then TakeTwo screwed us by taking away the mods and murdering the game with micro transactions. Apperntly me paying 59.99 when this was released wasn't enough money for them. If you haven't already bought this game. Don't. These are the kind of people who are killing gaming.
0;The only thing making GTA 5 fun was mods. Now Take Two banned them. I liked GTA 2 years ago but it got a bit boring a while after heists was released so I just had fun offline with mods and now they banned them. Really good job your sales will go down so much. p
0;Don't support Take Two Interactive's blatant money grubbing with this game. Great potential for modding thrown away to extract the maximum amount of money from the player base. No single player DLC so they can gouge you as much as possible in multiplayer. Thumbs down.
0;"""Coming in 2014 """"GTAV Story Mode Updates. For those ready to jump back into the story of Grand Theft Auto V we have big plans for substantial additions in 2014 continuing Michael Franklin and Trevor's action mayhem and unexpected adventures in Southern San Andreas."""""""
0;Game is fun but it crashes all the time on my laptop. The issue must be a memory leak because the fps counter is way above 60 when I play thus the videocard is not at fault here.Do not purchase this game for the online you will be dissapointed. The griding is not interesting and there are too many cheaters playing this game.&lt i7 4700mq&gt &lt gt 750m sli&gt
0;The online has been ruined by rampant hackers and connection problems. None of these issues have been addressed nor do I believe they will be as they've been problems since day 1. This game is fun when you can actually connect to the online and you can find a lobby without cheaters. Sadly that's a very small portion of the time. If you are looking for a fun game to play with friends GTA 5 is not for you.
0;Rockstars is not a community focused company they'll sap you for your money and thats about it. Plus this whole anti modding policys is rather stupid. They need to stop having their heads up their own arses for five minutes and listen to their playerbase.
0;On behalf of the OpenIV team if you want to buy this game to fly around as hulk have a tsunami rip across thelandscape or even just drive a non vanilla car. Dont expect to be able to do so Take Two are money grabbing bastards who think they can make modding illegal just so they can get a 2% increase in profit from GTA Online. Of course theyre banning everything apart from Online so you have to shell out $1bn to get some yacht.
0;A Soup review Grand Theft Auto V Score 4.5/10 Pros Cons 10/10 Graphics Total grindfest Alot of Content Everything costs atleast $1 000 000 in newer updates Good plot and storyline Multiplayer is repetitive Multiplayer lobbies are fun Multiplayer games can be fun if there were more players online Comments Fun to just mess around and mod. Buy when it's on sale.
0;Best games are ruined by the worst business people.Actual talent programmers artists script writers actors succeeded in making a great game. All it takes is one greedy psycopath with an MBA to ruin it all. And when they sink their blood sucking brittle teeth into something as iconic as GTA they can take the entire industry with it.Don't they teach you that at the community college? Don't alienate your customer base?
0;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME! Please do not support games whos distributors/devs are anti consumer. With the C&amp D of one of the largest modding tools (OpenIV) that is required by most mods to function they have single handedly killed the longevity of both GTA5 and GTA4. I for one purchaced GTA5 for the sole purpose of using mods as the story does not interest me.Until these companies learn that modding is not their enemy this will keep happening.
0;Take Two have shown their true colours like so many other companies. They care nothing about games or gamers only money. And a company that doesn't have an actual interest in the indusry they're in other than making money out of it is not deserving of your money.
0;Take 2 one of my favorite companies just lost all of my support while using RockStar as a meatshield. RockStar im sorry Take 2 is ruinning everything you work so hard to build. They have ALWAYS supported mods and only taken down mods which seriously involve license issues but Take 2 targeting the OpenIV team is beyond appalling SHAME on you Take 2!
0;Gta V ONLINE is probably the grindiest game you'll ever play earning money in this game is damn near impossible and is centered around you spending real dollars to get in game cash via shark cards. Sure it's possible to get cool things without paying but it takes a ridiculous amount of time in doing so.
0;R* Just banned hundreds if not thousands of people for 30 days and deleted their characters because their anti cheat code is garbage and probably farmed out to a third party. There is no ban or reset appeal and they have disconnected their support phone numbers. Do NOT invest time or money into this company until they fix their game fix their players accounts and issue a public apology for their calous actions
0;Gta V single player is great and worth about 40USD in my opinion. It's worth the full price if you are allowed to mod which is no longer the case.GTA Online has arguably more content than single player and would be worth paying the full price of the game for if it hadn't devolved into a huge grind fest. Overall I would not recommend the game for the price. If you love the usual GTA single player experience however this is a good game for you just maybe wait for a discount.
0;hate that i cant play offline dont want the multi player part only single player game. its been such a big issue for me that i wont be buying gta 6. i should be able to play offline if i only play single player game. Heres to restarting the game for the 5th time.
0;Great game but why the bad review?on launch almost 7 years ago this was the pinacle of gaming. everything looked good and played like nothing ever.sadly singleplayer is not really replayable and multiplayer is only fun if you have over 50000 euro's spend on sharkcards.A lot of people are trolls cheaters or just ignoring you. that doesn't really make the online mode very enjoyable.Sadly there is no fix for this.
0;Take Two has to be one of the greediest publishers ever. Even EA wouldn't pull off the stuff that they did. Who in their right mind thought they should ban mods? Thank god they eventually let open IV do what they want again. The game is still good but I wouldn't recommend getting this game right now like I did. Also online is fun with friends but toxic with random people (just a warning).
0;Singelplayer good 7/10Multiplayer rockstar don't care about pc version. 2/10Not possible to search for gamemodes custom games or heist. Not possible ot chose server either. Its really annoying not be able to browse servers its impossible to find games or sessions with people in them.If you have 4+ friends to play with then go ahead with the multiplayer otherwise do not expect much.
0;"""I realize the mod controversy is over...I'm leaving it as a negative review. That was beyond abysmall and it shouldn't have taken the outrage of their entire PC playerbase to change it. You know they wouldn't have done anything had we not reacted this way.So this is still a big old """" you"""" to Rockstar."""
0;Ya lets just stop playing this game. OpenIV was the only reason GTA games for PC lasted as long as they did between releases. Even console versions die out eventuality but there was always a great PC community to keep that game popular and being played now that won't be the case anymore.
0;All they give a damn about is siphoning more and more money out of you via online. Not only do they make it extremely hard to earn money through regular play they keep adding overly expensive content to try and push you to buy more ingame currency.And now they are disallowing mods probably to be seen again in the future under a paid mods scheme like so many other greedy companies are trying now. RIP GTA
0;another example of microtransaction ruining a game. If you spend $99 in cash you get 8 million dollars in game. With that much money you can buy at most 3 of the new vehicles being relased with the updates. At this rate you might as well save the money you'll spend on Shark Cards and buy actual physical vehicles. extremely disappointed in this game
0;what a online servers you can wait almost 10minuts to find a session and than you have lucky wtf boy fix that problem and we play witch more fun al not evry heist 10 ore 20 minuts waiting for the next heist storry is greed no problems witch it. it will be cool if you can dear CEO to only than you fight to npc online is a disepiring me
0;Killing your player base's ability to enjoy the single player game because you've neglected it in favour of pushing your multiplayer mode so you can make more money is disgusting. OpenIV didn't break any of the rules nor did it allow people to use mods in multiplayer. I don't see any reason to keep playing GTA V if Take Two doesn't want me to play it how I want to.
0;Its a great game but the the fact that modders get to run on a rampage and there doesn't seem to be any action taken what so ever against them makes it really hard to enjoy the game.. So if you intend to buy this game for the online part... maybe reconsider..
0;This game USED to be worth the Money however take 2 removed modding just for the money. this game is now trash because one car in the game is now like 3 4 mill which is like $40 so expensive. you cant appreciate this games full potential when things cost that much which is why modding was amazing because you could reach this games full potential. its a shame.
0;This game was fun until the moding comunity was ed. Now if you want to use some content you couldnt in the singlepayer you have to play on micro transaction Online where lagging is rampant and nothing is free. Bacically modders so thanks for the message rockstar or should I say Take 2 rockstars parent company who collects the most money rockstar makes from removing their unregulated fun.
0;After my many hours of gta online game play i can say that i have had fun. I even supported rockstar with some shark card cash. But now with the C&amp D sent to OpenIV and the modding community. i dident play the story on PC and i could have played online on my PS3. I was safe and the mods were the code and until the C&amp D is formly retracted consider your safe code changed.
0;Too many hackers in online lobbies. No client side anti cheat and now they've effectively made modding SINGLE PLAYER illegal.I will continue to play but won't spend any money.R* Take Two listen to this Bring good client side anti cheat. Allow and even support SINGLE PLAYER modding.
0;Today would have to rob the first chapter task then direct second money to buy a skeletal horse is half done directly by wrong letters. If you didn't ability of anti cheating program do not engage in so at least we these normal game players can play. A few days ago also play well but also that the mistake was not so serious as to seal the comments now it seems oh this game is a waste!
0;I do recommend GTA 5 but not its online contents.Super long loading for everything single thing.I tried various online contents over three days and any interesting online content made me to wait for long time.I spent more time for waiting than actual game play.Felt like I was not doing anything but waiting rolling my eyes..
0;Rockstar is too greedy. Every update they add more and more expensive content in hopes to get players to buy shark cards. If you buy this game be prepared to drop hunderds of dollars for shark cards or spend years grinding repetitive missions to earn money.
0;Take Two has just made there 0 reason to purchase this. I only spent the 60$ so I could enjoy the singe player mods that make the game so much more enjoyable. Now that they have illegally started a war against mods I recommend you do not purchase this game. The only reason I bought this game was to play with mods. Thanks a lot Take Two!
0;Well now mods are gone.Fantastic.Also they want to make the microtransactions even more expensive.Apparently making billions with the fourth best selling game of all time isn't enough and screwing over the modding community is the next logical step. Go yourself Take Two.
0;Multiplayer is a focus to make more money from you dispite the fact you've paid full price for the game. Modding has now been targeted as low and behold it doesnt make them more money via microtransactions! Way to beat a dead horse and then make it do some more work.
0;This is the last RS / T2 game I will have bought. These companies are literally only interested in your money and don't give a damn about any fun that you might have with their game. In fact they actively work towards preventing you having fun while playing their game and start threatening you with legal action if you're having too much of it modding . this Stuff your dollars up your arses T2! See if that makes you happy!
0;"""To quote many others...""""On behalf of the OpenIV team you.""""Update While they have allowed OpenIV it still do not change the fact that they are obsessed with DLC's for online only in an attempt to sell more shark cards wich are a gigantic pile of overpriced s.h.i.t..."""
0;Yeah so online gets pretty boring just about as fast as gta IV's the only reason to play it is for the single player and after the campaign the only thing that can actually keep this game playable is the mods. No more mods because take two int. is complete shite so them dont buy.
0;The physics were better in GTA IV. This one seems like some features were drawn back in order to fit the online part. Which at this point is just a shameless grab for your cash. Wanna spend real money for fake money? This is your game. This game makes me worried for the sequel to red dead if this is how its going to shape up.
0;When a game that alot of people bought for single player modding essentially bans it after being out this long after already miking multiple copies out of people in some cases on different platforms you have to wonder who the hell that that would be a sound idea that will go down with the community...
0;I love the single player campaign of this game that the PC port is fantastic. If you are buying this game solely for the single player campaign by all means I reccomend it.However I can not reccomend this game as a whole due to just how terrible the online portion has been treated in the long term. It has turned into a pay to win system where virtually the same content is released every few months with a slightly different theme and a massive paywall is thrown on it.
0;I don't usually write reviews but if you are reading this I ask you immediately and completely boycott any and all products and services related to Take Two InteractiveAddressing the issue of teaching by threatning mod tool makers is backasswards stupid and an outdated out of touch concept.
0;Guess Rockstar really hates it's customers! Micro Transactions are crazy! It's hard to do anything without spending REAL MONEY in the game and mods for the SINGLE PLAYER have just been banned..... Goodjob rockstar! Thats one way to make people that really enjoy your game to hate you!
0;Product received for free. Literally killed off single player mods NONE of the multiplayer content makes it into single player because T2/R* need to milk the cash cow and if people played single player and modded in the from multiplayer then they'd lose money I guess. Don't play this it's bad.
0;Game play is nice and the graphics compelling. Unfortunately the game crashes constantly. This is know and happens to many other players. Rockstar is not supporting or offering a bug fix. I am able to play for 30 min crash. The frequency changes sometimes I cant even load the game. Sucks for 60 USD....
0;I don't know what suddenly caused you to outlaw modding Take Two.This is the only reason I play the game ngl. There's no reason to play now.Don't buy this. There's no reason to buy it anymore. The modding community was the best part of this game and trying to outlaw it is simply asinine and nonsensical as you're decreasing sales and causing outrage in the GTA 5 PC community.So sincerely you Take Two Interactive. you for befouling such a perfect game.
0;do not buy / do not playHackers everywhere online not to mention terribly inflated prices and progression for online so as to promote the sale of t shark cards. Now Take Two goes after single player mod support. Hope this game hits mixed/mostly negative overall status soon.. 
0;I would give this game a positive review if the developers had not abandoned the single player but they have.The only thing worth a damn in this game is the online multiplayer but that is riddled with cheaters and an overall toxic community. In the few games that I have found that dont have these the game is quite enjoyable.The game is also quite unstable and causes my pc to freeze completely requiring a restart (its the only program that does this but it could just be me being stupid so idk).
0;"""Take Two has decided completely arbitrarily and for no apparent reason that """"mods are illegal"""" and have threatened legal action against passionate Grand Theft Auto mod developers. Therefore I have decided their game is garbage and not to be recommended. Play stupid games win stupid prizes eh?"""
0;Unless you hack your way to at least level 100 there is no point to playing online. Can't have a fair shake at anything. Wanna race level 100's have fully modded cars while you drive Want to do missions dont bother hackers warp to all the check points and do everything before you can even get moving. IMO wait till this game is free then and only then will it be worth anything.
0;The single player for this game was decent online is a bit of a mess but also decent in its own way But what really makes this game replayable over and over for me and well worth its price is its modability Something Take Two and Rockstar is trying to put an end to for this future of installing mods is uncertain i at this time cannot recommend the game.
0;I got GTA on a steam sale. I dont have enough money to buy the game at full price. I decided to get mods so i dont have to farm money or buy shark cards (which are expensive). However Take Two got rid of modding in GTA even single player. Because of this i cant enjoy playing this game anymore and it is no longer a fun sandbox game. I guess its time to go back to playing Gmod
0;What they did simply made me mad the only reason that I got into GTA is to play LSPDFR and other thing's like that. They really hurt the modding community with what they did. I simply will not support them anymore. If you are looking to get into the modding community don't buy this game!
0;The game gets old fast. The novelty wears off quickly and the way that content is locked to the multiplayer then locked behind a grind/pay wall means the game benefits from having a vibrant modding scene. Bringing constant new content to the game. The recent decision by take 2 effectively executed the modding scene. If I could refund the game I would.
0;This game is f*cking god awful I literally got banned for no reason and Rockstar doesn't do jack sh*t about it because they no longer appeal bans yet they still have it as an option on their website. Their new update yesterday got me banned permanently for no reason and they won't do anything about it. Absolutely pathetic.
0;"""Mass banning and deleting of countless innocent accounts with only a smug """"You cannot fight your ban and we won't even tell you what you did wrong"""" as a reply.SP is great but given they abandoned it long ago Online should be avoided as should future rockstar titles such as RDR2."""
0;I don't know why it took people so freaking long to realize that both publisher as well as developer are so heavily anti consoumer in pretty much every freaking way.At least they pushed it far enough this time for even the most oblivious person to notice.
0;For the time being don't take a step near this game. Take Two has to understand modding in SINGLEPLAYER is fundemental in PC gaming. Singleplayer mods don't hurt anyone sometimes they're funny kickass or fix a dev's broken game. Step back and take another look before committing down this road Take Two.
0;worst GTA yest so ridiculously boring. Lacks direction and instruction feels like a free for all sandbox game with no point and making money couldn't be harder unless you run around and beat people to death and steal theor money which gives you $10 to $20 per person then after each mugging you have to run around from the pigs to lower your wanted level not worth the money at all!
0;I used to like GTAV. I loved modding the single player game turning it into something more than what it was. But with Take Two and Rockstar's effective ban of modding even in single player I cannot support Take Two or Rockstar anymore. Unless they go back on what they've done they've completely lost me as a customer.
0;Will they spend their money to bully modding teams? Definitely.Will they attempt to gouge every penny they can out of their player base? Definitely.Will they spend their money bringing you meaningful content fix problems and keep promises? Absolutely not.
0;I used to really like this game but now it's just terrible. In online Rockstar have done nothing to combat the hackers in this game doing as little as just wiping many player's hacked money which doesnt really solve the real problem. Do not spend your money on shark cards they are a scam.
0;They perma ban me at the first time for no reason I was playing with some friends then the mision lagged and log all of us out and then ban my other friends for 2 months. I mean 1st ban permaban???? The game have alot of hacker messing the up killing all the server spaming things and I get permaban 1st time. There should be a way to at least try to solve the problem. The game is cool but if you are going to lose your money like that NO THANKS.
0;"""Since the recent """"ban"""" on modding and attack on Open IV I cannot in good faith recomend this game purely because they do not support their community. All Take Two is doing is hurting themselves. You can bet your a** that this is the last game I will be purchasing from them."""
0;Gta V was a great game before devs lost it. Story mode is still great and playable but Online is ruined. Devs made money making grindy that it would encourage people to spend money to buy ingame cash. People who have spent money to buy ingame cash or get it by cheats get ridiculous weapons or vehicles to kill normal players.Good job Rockstar.
0;Great game. Great story. But online sucks. Deal with hacker/modders most of the time or deal with long load times or never ending game queues. Buy this if u want it for the story or have a number of friends to load up a private server to play together.
0;Grand Theft Auto V.After almost 400 hours on this game i have realised something.The story is fun and much to do then the online part comes. On story mode you get much money from that lil Lester boi but in online it gets quite interesting. Yes it have updates often but you need to be Bill Gates to have fun. So basicly the game is quite bad.But Viktor buys it.
0;I loved adding mods to gta v but now I can't enjoy the game. Thank you very much Take Two and go ***k yourselves. I want a refund because I bought this game for the mods but you got rid of the one reason me and TONS of others bought the game. I encourage anyone reading to do the same.
0;Single player great fun good storyline if a little short.Online Micro transactions from hell. Could have been good but instead all they do is make it as hard as possible to earn any cash so you end up buying shark cards for real money.Rockstar ruined this game with their greed.Don't expect any single player expansions while they farm the micro transactions either.
0;Take Two are either idiots or liars as pointed out by NerdCubed as they are actively destroying the modding scene when there are alternative routes to eliminate hackers in GTA Online. This cannot be accepted as it will only lead to other companies to follow suit. On behalf of the OpenIV team from this day foward for an indefinite period I will boycott all Take Two games and I urge others to do the same.
0;After pouring countless hours grinding in the online portion of the game without ever modding I recieved a ban from rockstar telling me that I was banned for a month and all my online character would be completely reset. I wrote a lengthy appeal to them as well only to be responded with automated response saying that I wrote the entire appeal for nothing. Thanks rockstar
0;Only applicable for online mode They ban you for no reason then say their system is flawless and if it makes a mistake it is resolved immediately which obviously doesn't happen.Dont buy this game even if the ban system was perfact as they claim. if you dont wanna spend literally 50 dollars just to start having fun with a single update then expect multiple dozens of hours of grinding plus they often patch good ways to get money so you spend more in microtransactions
0;"""Any hope of single player DLC for this game is lost Sad to see how so much potential is wasted in place for cash grabs and their online. I kept asking myself """"Maybe they'll add some single player dlc after a few online updates"""" Nope just more and more online updates."""
0;Really disappointed only reason me and a lot of people brought this game was to mod and you have stoked that nodding is not illegal and you know that you just want to push people onlinr so they spend more money on you ing micro transactions I hope you get so many negative reviews you are forced to revert back. Modding kept the PC version of this game alive time to watch it burn.
0;"""Rockstar customer support is hands down the worst support I have ever dealt with. Now fortunately I haven't been wrongfully banned yet but a day ago a hacker put me into """"bad sport"""" and made it look like I had killed a ton of people in passive mode. I talked to rockstar support and they basically told me to go myself. Also modders are in almost every session and will use godmode and kill you indiscriminately. 10/10 gr8 game."""
0;"""Rockstar and 2K just killed modding for the GTA community. It's the reason I ing bought the game. The story is The online community is filth. But I spent $60 on this game to """"have fun."""" This game was the ultimate playground and modding is what made that possible. Look at the modded bethesda titles. They're huge and successful in large part because of the modding community. Rockstar and 2K made billions on this title. But to shut down modding is a step too far. off."""
0;A big reason that people buy GTA games is the replayability you get with mods. Take 2 has been launching an assault on all modding done to the game with GTA V and sent a cease and desist to the backbone of all modding in the GTA series Open IV. When you give the middle finger to content creators that give your game 1000's of hours in replayability then you don't deserve the modding community. T2 and the GTA series. You aren't anything special.
0;Take Two deciding to close down the modding scene and ruining the biggest part in the GTA franchise has really ruined their own reputation. Not only this but banning innocent players for getting dropped money in online reseting their accounts and no way to appeal this makes it even worse. Stay as far away from anything that Take Two has their fingers in.
0;I didn't really have a lot of patience for this game I used to really enjoy it and mods for it were what made it lastThe constant loading screens the amount of hackers in just about every lobby how expensive everything is to buyIt's just turned into a load of crap
0;Though I should be happy that almost all modders are gone the problem is single player mods are gone too. I really enjoy the single player mods more than online. Also there are some modders who are nice that game me some money since I've only started to play.
0;If the online part of the game wasn't filled with hackers and trolls the game would probably be fun.The game has become a huge money sink since they introduced yachts.That said GTA5 the single player game is the best one so far.DO NOT BUY for the online content. Not worth it.
0;Getting a little too gready for a healthy future. Killing Mods is self destructive in the long run. There again you may not have a long run seeing as you are ignoring the people that pay for your product. GTA V is ok (albeit overpriced) as a stand alone. Multiplayer is a waste of your game time. Unhappy bunch live there.
0;OK... so heres the thing. GTAV awesome story and good looking game... BUT the online portion... its just farm simulator... seriously to get a decent ing car you need to farm either heists MC missions or now the NEW GUN RUNNING MISSIONS... the online economy sucks tbh... players are cancer... its just bleh
0;A shamw that it comes to this but if you're going to restrict single player in such a cynical cash grab manner don't be surprised that people mod your game. To then send those modders a cease and desist for simply allowing us to play with content we payed for is shameless and ethically bankrupt. Single player was and remains my favorite aspect of gaming and to see it targeted in this way is disheartening.
0;GTA 5 was fun playing with mods on singleplayer and playing with friends on multiplayer. Good time waster.Now all it is is DLC's Sharkcards and just a bunch of useless crap they are adding.If you want to get all the new stuff and you have very little money there is no point. It will take you too long to get the money. They basically want you to pay money to get money.However it still can be a fun time if you play just with friends.
0;Single Player Great storyline/Gameplay.Multiplayer The 'server' is really bad and needs a lot of improvement. You have to put so much time grinding for cash because all the luxury stuffs are expensive as . I've been disconnected so many times due to some router related problems. Some people just want to kill you for no reason. I don't like the Social Club. Shark Cards shows how greedy R* is.Conclusion If you buy this game just to play online avoid it.
0;Modding is one of the things that makes your games great. Embrace your playerbase let it flourish and make money through your current schemes. Find a way to stop the online cheating without killing your image. Punishing single player is not the way to solve your problems.
0;Just wanna let you know that the publisher doesn t care about your online mode experience and just kinda destroys the game a bit more with every update. The possibility of having connection issues or server problems is very high and public lobbies are full griefing and hacking players.For a detailed review continue scrolling.
0;It's no coincidence that now GTA V has shark cards Rockstar has decided that maybe if they can get rid of a 10 year old mod they'll get more gamers to buy shark cards.Rockstar make fantastic games but my word they are ignorant arrogant greedy scumbags.
0;What a wonderful game this is... Undeniably a ground breaking game however T2 Management have decided to go and self destruct their business with the worst derailment since I installed train engineer mod for GTA5. This game and modding go hand in hand and its a shame to see T2 not noticing this. Instead of more DLC for us please can you fix the people within your business who make decisions that will bring them more money instead of happy clientsShame
0;Take Two decided to set fire to the modding community for no reason. This didn not impact the amount of hackers online nor did this improve the game. If you want to get rid of hackers fix your anticheat first before you go around shutting down entire projects in a knee jerk reaction.
0;Rockstar has turned into one of my most hated companies after the crap they pulled with OpenIV. Completely ditching the PC community to the curb. AGAIN. I loved GTA V and I just re installed it two weeks ago to play with mods. Lo and behold they forced an update to kill the mods and ban OpenIV. Screw you Rockstar.
0;Again Rockstar trashes a wonderful game making you TRYING to log through the useless crap that it's Social Club. Hey you pay 40 for the game but then the make you text after test after test to prove that you are not a bot wich is t. I hope the guy who came with the idea of Social Club gets trapped in some dystopic society where he has to fill a form after another until he jumps throught a window.
0;I probably wouldnt even buy this game on sale right now.GTA Online connectivity is absolute I can play Battlefield 1 PUBG Division any other game perfectly fine without any connectivity problems but oh HELLO GTA Online servers must be hosted in ing Zimbabwe. If you get this game expect your friends/you to disconnect roughly every 20 30mins in the middle of supply or sale runs completely wiping out hours of your effort. Until they fix the connectivity issues dont waste your money.
0;Was one of my favorite games to play. Wasted many hours having great fun but ever since they introduced all kinds of rocket bikes and idiotic stuff like that the game is totally ruined because it's out of balance. Also tons of scripters in basically every session making the game almost unplayable.Don't buy this if you don't already have it it is a waste of your doe.
0;Just as anyone else will say modders run the game. Even if you dont the anticheat will get you because someone turned you into a damn christmas tree. I loved this game I've owned it on 3 different platforms PC being most enjoyable until you get banned for nothing.Buy it get banned. They made their money so they wont accept any reasoning why they should overturn a perma.
0;this game. Okay not the Game but the Support. You can write a normal conversation with them they always close it after 1 text. I got 3 times temporary banned for nothing. i didnt hacked or used bugs or anything. I wasnt online at the times after the bans and then i got banned again. Now its a perma ban. DONT BUY THIS GAME.
0;Start game for first time in 6 months after previous ban for being turned into a shark...load into game. money drops everywhere. permanant ban.fark it custom server time. don't bother buying gtav unless you firewall their public amazon servers otherwise you forget that accidently joining a public game will result in a permanat ban.
0;Really enjoyed this game and the modding side of it had a humongous part of gta v now they shutdown modding to maximise profits ??? when take two are already swimming in cash no longer making games fun but maximising cash intake. Dont buy this a game without devs behind it is a game to own.
0;lots of cheating all the time. if you ever get a response from rockstar they just tell you they wont help you with anything. the game has just become a crap hole with bad support. you can get banned from a modder giving you money even though you cant stop it or even if its you reporting the issue.
0;used to be a good game. R* is trying to make a ton of money by practially forcing people to buy SharkCards. But thanks to PCMR modders save the day. Also they make an update about Planes without buffing the only weapon in the game that can counter planes.
0;Mods kept this giant alive in our eyes. Being able to openly change everything about the game IN SINGLEPLAYER so that it kept refreshing its shelf life was the only reason I still enjoyed GTA 5. Without mods I've uninstalled. I bet Take Two is having a double take PUNZ at how quickly they tanked this for the community.
0;Beautiful game and very fun to play under normal cercumstances however it has become a place for modders now and therefore breeds nothing but toxic lobbies. If you like snow planes falling out the sky being invited against your will to wherever the mad scientist with the mod menu decides to take you being killed in unusual ways over and over and over and over again then this is definitely the game for you!
0;Similarily to certain DRM practices and it's effect on the paying user the stance Take Two is taking on modding only hurts the users rather than preventing any malacious activity in the game. Why a company thinks they have the right to prevent a user from meddling with a purchased product specifically if they are not interfering with the play of others baffles me and should be fought.
0;This is a great single player game but it's a garbage multiplayer game with an incredibly toxic community pay to win mechanics awful matchmaking incredibly long load times frequent crashes disconnects and lag. The multiplayer experience is so infuriating so poorly designed and poorly implemented that it makes me want to punch someone at Rockstar in the face repeatedly.
0;This stupid there is no party mode in online. When you play closed missions you need to be on the same private server and you still get placed with other people sometimes. And even if you play in a closed game you get placed on different servers after the mission is done. ing add party mode cant be that hard...
0;Single Player 10/10 Online 6/10Developer 9/10Publisher 1/10It wouldn't be 2018 without pay to win (Sharkcards). I'm surprised they haven't added loot boxes yet. The grind is not worth it and you'd have to have a huge disposable income to be able to buy everything in game. I blame Take Two Interactive. As profits have increased in game earnings have remained small and every item is more expensive than the last. Its just not fun. Bummer is I heard Red Dead Redemption 2 Online is just as bad.
0;I won't recommend buying this game because although its a nice game it has good graphics it has good content etc. You will at somepoint get temporarily banned for no reason and a month or two after you get unbanned you will get permanently banned for no reason. You can buy it at your own risk don't tell me that i did not warn you. 30$ ain't worth it if you get banned for no reason.
0;Modding has been a big part of the GTA series since San Andreas. Removing the biggest mod on the platform which enables other modders easier ways to creat and play is unfounded and appaling. this game just lost 80 90% of the biggest mods out there. So Take Two Have fun losing 80 90% of your modding fanbase. I HATE YOU!
0;ALWAYS do friends invite sessions and DO NOT talk to other players. I joined a random session and went passive to customise my vehicle and bang! Vote kicked for no reason whatsoever. Go mod singleplayer do LSPDFR or something. Online is just pure toxicity and grind.
0;Nothing but a hacker's wet dream now. Singleplayer is fine but if you're buying this to do Multiplayer with friends better get used to having your fun ruined by people who can spawn invincible cages around you teleport you and your friends to random locations and kill everyone in the server with the push of a button.Despite all this they still push for you to buy their Shark cards for ingame money.
0;GTA V single player is 10/10 no point in writing a review about that.GTA Online on the other hand...its toxic cummunity never seen this much griefers and tryhards in any other games. GTA online is just ture hell they also added jet bike which is even worse. I'm finally done....
0;They removed mods from the campaign for people who doesn't know WHY it is because they wanted to push the players play multiplayer more often and pay for his shi11y $$$$$$hark cards in my opinion if they care about hacking or how is actually hard to get a good card or airship or whatever people will play multiplayer to be honest but the game is basically a p2w
0;Story mode is great amazing story and really put together well. Online is terrible. If you play online be prepared to loose everything at anytime. Hackers can simply spawn money on top of you and you will get banned and character reset with ABSOLUTELY no chance at appealing a ban. Rockstar will simply ban you reset your character and couldn't care less about it
0;"""Beware This Online game is """"Remarkable"""".You need to get hacks menu prevents you being banned.You have to cheat to treat as a noncheaterOr if you're new guy to Los Santos You probly will get banned after tutorial racing Larmar.Now the record is 0.6 hour.It's good game but people in there are toxic.so are Rstar support."""
0;okay i understand banning online mods but all mods is stupid how am i going to be iron man in gta story mode that is so stupid to remove one of the features that people buy the pc version i bought it for moding my story mode not to play the story mode because it gets boring after campaign i refuse to purches any other game if this is how you wil treat your fans
0;Thanks to Take Two's action against the singleplay modding scene. there's virtually no reason to play this unless you want to play the utter grindfest that's GTA Online have fun with the hackers and lack of anti cheat.GTAV's sandbox combined with modding made this game so great but without that there's no point having it on PC.
0;An excellent game plagued by a money hungry company. This game and especially its online has huge potential and his a joy to play however the constant push of micro transactions and the recent changes to SINGLE PLAYER MODDING have forced me to leave this negative review.
0;Uninstalled today.Online play is centered around grinding boring missions and accumulating Rock$tarbux.Matchmaking takes an eternity and the server will probably drop you 3 times in the process.Online community is full of offensive children and full grown losers. Fun to play around with on console as a time waster or something while drinking beer with bros. Utterly fails as a PC game.
0;REMOVE ing explosive rounds from heavy sniper mk II it is the most cancerous thing to have been introduced since the hydra. Unbalanced and though it might cost a higher price what s do the people give about a weapon that can 1 shot a maxed player with hvy armour and BST.
0;If you're just buying this for single player it's a pretty good game. If you're thinking of going online forget it. The online part of this game is not a game anymore it's a Shark Card sale generator where game mechanics are designed to make you want to use real money instead of making you have fun.
0;Rockstar has to fix the game!!!!Everyone I know has been banned from this game for no reason.Great! Now I cant play GTA online anymore ( The only reason why I played this game at all )It wasen't even my fault! A modder came in to my session and gave me alot of money and i couldn't even move. I tried to leave the game but the it was to late. I was already banned.Please do something
0;Don't waste your time with GTA Online. I put hundreds of hours into my online character working towards the ridiculous cash amounts necessary to buy any of the cool stuff only to have R* suspend me and wipe my character. I had never cheated modded recieved modded cash or anything and yet they're broken system banned me and they do not let you appeal the ban.
0;to many modders/hackers in this game. if its not a modder killing you its a surprise attack by rockstar on your buisness. if you are not ready to defend it or you die you lose all your hard earned cash. if you decide to buy the game cheet everyone else is.
0;&gt Modder Cages Me From Across Map&gt Blows me up&gt Starts spawning money on me&gt after telling him to stop and 100mil later I begin to leave&gt he maxes my stats&gt i log on the next day&gt banned for a monthwhat a company I get banned because some modder dropped against my will. they could just put down stats and money but nah lets ban him
0;*EDIT 12/1/2018 GTA Online is still full of cheaters and modders and probebly will be forever.Pros Fun to play with friends (in the past) Lots of stuff to do Pretty good 8/10 storylineCons about 60% of the population is cheaters in some form of way and you will run into them 24/7 Community is complete Cheater detection is complete All Rockstar cares about is pumping out DLC for you to pay for with shark cards or cheat money for. Bottom line the online game play is extremly pointless.
0;THANK TOU ROCKSTAR YOU F****D IT UP!!It is impossible to make money in this game because of kids and trolls. IF YOU WANT A GOOD ONLINE GAME DONT WASTE MONEY IN THIS BS. Nice way of earn money by doing gta cash nearly impossible of earn in tha game. Instead of that you buy shark cards or die tryin' to make money.It's even more dissapointing because the game itself it's great
0;It's not R* banning mods and making everything obsurdly expensive it's T2 to blame. Because of this I wouldn't recommend buying the game since the publishers are greedy who already earned $3+ billion and STILL want more. I hope the amount of negativity this game is getting will set them back in the right mood. For the moment being do not purchase this game.
0;Lost access to my Social Club account and now I can't play the game. There is no way to play offline and you cannot link another Social Club account to 1 Steam account... What's that buy this game 1 more time? I'm alright thanks.Where's Red Dead for PC?
0;Was fun with mods significantly less without. If there were any more micro transactions in GTA Online it would become a mobile game. With mods 9/10Without mods 8/10GTA Online Cash Grab/10Wait until they realize that they messed up by banning mods then buy it
0;Havn't really modded GTA 5 But I spent a lot of time with a modded copy of GTA IV and i can understand the frustration theese othher reviewers are having. That is why I stand behind them. Seriously you guys are WAY too harsh on people who just wants to have some fun in your game and it all sounds even worse when you add the fact that the modding is for SINGLEPLAYER
0;Rockstar needs to do a better job with detecting modders and hackers. I see constant props being spawned into Multiplayer lobbies on certain people. This is guaranteed to happen all the time. Things like ghost cars armed NPCs money bags cages to trap other players etc. Singleplayer is the way to go.
0;GTA Online went from a fun time with your friends to a grid fest. Anything you can do costs an absurd amount of money and they do this so you'll buy more shark cards. On top of that there are so many modders that even if you wanted to grind to make money you're constantly getting blown up trapped or your money taken. Even if this game was free you should still avoid this game as it is not worth the time you put into it.
0;"""Who would ever support a company that literally kills its own playerbase? Remove modding was the biggest mistake. An insult to everyone.Update They've just nuked a lot of player's money from online for no good reason why do you keep on making enemies R* and T2? It blows my mind on how stupid you guys can be. Just let your players enjoy the game for once. Isn't that why you called it a game in the first place? I never knew this game was """"extort money simulator 2k17""""."""
0;great game fun to play with friends but is such a grind to actually unlock anything. My previous rating of 8/10 has been taken down to 2/10 for the amount of stuff you have to do just to be able to compete with other players. Having over 500 hours on both Xbox and PC I still find myself struggling to keep up with other players. This is because of shark cards. I no longer recommend this game.2/10
0;if this game isnt loaded with modders who ruin the game its ruind buy rockstar and their development missions bugg on the regular and you get cheated outta your money so many time just in the past 2 days iv had ceo and Mc missions take all my stock and just erase it. this game im uninstalling.
0;Take Two Interactive really showed its consumers the middle finger by taking a hard stance against mods despite the modding community being the lifeblood of the grand theft auto franchiseTake Two has quietly withdrawn their cease and desist against OpenIV their stance against modders is still unclear.The story mode is good but online is trash do not recommend.
0;Destroying modding destroyed your own game. Did you think it was actually fun without the mods!? Haha. You're online is a money scheme. You're story mode was abandoned at launch. The content created is rarely fun. Like come the on. Take your head outta your arrogant asses.
0;Once was a great game nowadays its controlled by cheaters and modders ignored by developers who have only one way to handle cheater issues and that is the ban wave hammer which %90 of the times lands on the heads of the legit players while the cheaters get a way from punishment .#ForAllTheWrongfullyBanned
0;The game is filled with cheaters ursing MOD menus.The game stability isnt anything to talk aboutAlso when selling the business things like crates cars etc when the game bugs out and you cant finish the sale you lose everything and rockstar support wont help you.
0;"""Wow! So having near $2 BILLION in sales isn't enough? It's f**ked up how greedy R* and Take Two are. SMH Screw your loyal fans huh? I've played online on PS4/PC and only came arcoss a few """"modded cheaters"""". The only reason they care is because they don't have a need to buy Shark Cards tbh. Can't believe I purchased the game for 360 then PS4 then PC. I won't be supporting any R* games if R* doesn't support its fans... Take that how you want."""
0;Singleplayer is slow and unless you play a certain way you never make enough dosh to afford everything.Multiplayer is essentially a trollfest and it's just not fun 99% of the time.Overwhelming grind in online and virtual certainty of losing progress as well as possibly your real ($$$) money if you buy shark cards.Mass banning any modding is the last straw.
0;The story mode is an awesome experience.However multiplayer is as toxic trash as one game can be. The horrible grind just so they can get cash cards are insane!While I would have recommended this game for the multiplayer aspect I cannot. Also story mode barely gets any updates so theres that. The devs want you to focus on multi.Compared to Red Dead Redemption or GTA IV's multiplayer this multipalyer is really bad experience.
0;"""you Rockstar and Take Two. You sorry sons of b's. First of all you don't know how to manage GTA V Multiplayer you should hire the players that used to and play GTA SA MP they are the ones that know how to run a MP game. Not sessions... they are impossible to administrate that's why you have lot's of """"modders"""" roaming free on you sessions."""
0;This game was good on 360 was good on ps4. But on PC this game is COMPLETE trash. you cant get into a single lobby without atleast 4 people in there god mode hacking and attacking on sight. So if Rockstar ever actually bans the hackers that completely ruin this game and make it unplayable. I might give it a better review. But as of right now. Dont waste your money on PC GTA. Complete waste of time. Nothing is legit. Hacker/Troll paradise. IF i could i would get a refund.
0;+ Really fun game (when it works)+ Hours played / game price ratio is really great A lot of people having Session disconnect issues R* seems to only care for Shark Cards each patch objective consist in trying to block the money hacks Each patch breaks the game even more Session left... oh wait I think I said that before Hackers Session left.. wait... Loading time Session left... humm P2P lobbies Session leftSo for the moment I wont re... Session left...

0;GIVE ME BACK MY GTAV MODDING!!!!!!!!!!! Take TWO????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????What are you thinking??More money I know hahaahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaSIGN. Don't think for your furture. So ....We won't pay any money for your game anymore! BYEBYE
0;Absolutely pathetic action from TakeTwo interactive. If you think this is going to earn you money think again. No ones going to buy a rehashed GTA5 with no single player mod support. You've just killed imo! one of the top YouTube gaming contents. GTA5 is on Youtube because of the Modding that can be done. Now you've just blown it out of the water. Stay away from the Gaming community. I hope your rating falls below No Mans Sky's.
0;Way too much grinding. gameplay is alright but don't even consider pvp unless you have the latest most op thing that costs millions of in game money (or $20 of irl money). Lot of cheaters and hackers too that provide cheaper services. I generally prefer them. Ironic the game taking the out of cxapitalism ends up becoming capitalist. I guess money means more to them than the message they trying to spread?
0;Infinite loading screens/disconnects.Toxic/noob players.Cheaters.Low amount players in lobbys.No penalty leaving mission or killing others players.Missions too easy with armored cars.Lower than 4 ppl cant finish mission if someone dies or leaves middle of it.Game is broken.
0;Single player was great. The several hundreds of hours I logged on Online were great too until I got a random ban with no appeal allowed and my online character reset completely.Good job Rockstar I dont forsee buying your games ever again in my future.
0;"""Bought this game on 360 for it's Single Player re bought it for Online when it still had hope in it's """"economy."""" Every update was a complete dissapointment added solely to kill solo play and kill the online entirely.Well you succeeded good luck on RDR2 I'll pass."""
0;The multiplayer is almost unplayable due to the amount of hackers. 3/5 games you will experience some using mods that can crash your game spawn in vehicles set everyone on the server on fire you name it. I would enjoy playing Multiplayer and grinding through the rediculously long grind if indeed it were possible but alas due to the hackers it simply isnt. You would expect such a huge company to have proper security for there flagship game!
0;It's a bit borring. Already seen story. Sadly you can't do something else like being a cop or a fed... It's the same old criminal way that gets borring after the first run. Driving is awesomeCity is awesomeMusic and environment nicely donePeople around you and the culture awesome work as always. Lots of vehicles. After finishing the game one time I had no more desire to play. It was just boring.
0;Useless at R* can't even fix the issue of not being able to connect to online services.Newer content requires you to purchase insanely expensive 'pre requisite' stuff in order to purchase said content for a lower price just another way of making people purchase sharkcards.2/10 just wait for GTA 6.
0;Pro and Contras You can have fun with your FRIENDS on races heist or another mods (rpg...)I feel always that I'm in another REAL world.but in online there is modder hacker just everywhereand Opperessor MK II maniacs. I cant drive a car in city when some1 flies Mk II.4/10 I would give.
0;Dont buy this game unless you want to play on a private server....the second you want to play somewhat serious here comes along a modder to ruin your entire game and blow all of you up. So you go find a new game damn now this game server has 5 modders in it with god mode and explosives and spawning crap in. THis game is cool the community is crap.
0;This PC version of GTA5 was manly because of the modding side of all of it but now that RockStar and Take Two have decided to attack the backbone of most of the mods for GTA5 and 4 with a law suit instead of working together to sort out the issue together all becuase they were worried a mod would mess with their multiplayer therefore until RockStar and Take Two get their act together and fix the only reason why people got it on PC i do not recommend this game to anyone.
0;Sadly with Take Two's recent involvment with the enormous modding community I cannot for any reasons recommend this game. Do not buy it do not support Take Two until they have emerged from their ignorance and once again allow modding. If you can sign the petition against Take Two's decision. DO NOT BUY THE GAME.
0;You are so greedy and so shady you make EA look good. GG Rockstar.EDIT I would list why Rockstar is so greedy and and shady. But if you go look at many of the other reviews They have already covered it for me no need in posting the same thing someone has already posted.
0;Another example of a company completely out of touch with it's players. A company focusing their entire business model with their online service selling in game money and with a shockingly bad customer service which in most cases you will receive an automated response so of course they would shut down Open IV a modding program that focuses on SINGLE player mods. This is not the same company that I used to love. YOU I won't be buying another one of your games.
0;I sent an email to rockstar doing everything they told me to do to get unbanned. It took a good 30 minutes out of my day just to get told all bannes are final. WHY DO THEY EVEN TELL YOU TO SEND THEM EMAILS I WAS ONLY USING MODS IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE!? Anyway now the game is pointless to me.
0;Story mode It's certainly weaker than say San Andreas but worth a playthrough. The only reason you'd ever want to buy the game (well maybe also for FiveM).Online Biggest piece of turd toppled only by something like Fallout 76. Don't be fooled by all the recent updates and seemingly huge playerbase updates turn the game into a bad Saints Row 4 wannabe and the playerbase consists of nothing but script kiddies tryhards and rarely people who dared to suffer through it all.
0;You have no chance to play normally if you kill a cheater Dan you will be frozen or the cheater posts your ip in the chat and ddost you massive security holes make this possible and rockstargames and Take Two Interactive are interested in not cheater continue.Here's the video evidencehttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v w_3g2LwtXTA
0;To Take two actually develop anti cheat measures and stop blaming modding programs for hackers. I understand that you want people to purchase shark cards but heres the thing NO ONE WANTS YOUR MICROTRANSACTIONS! NOT YOURS OR ANY OTHER COMPANIES! be thankful that even a few people waste their money on such a stupid idea. Your action of taking down OpenIV instead of actually dealing with the problem is laziness and greed pure and simple.
0;Take2 trying to remove modding from GTAV and future games will follow.Mods for video games make them so much more fun.Plus I hope I don't need to remind anyone but a lot of games today were once mods for other games but were so good that they were made on their own.
0;every new update is the last one with a different theme &amp inflated figures the content is locked behind a paywall and basically is single player grinding missions. this is not fun anymoreand that er tony wont stop calling you to buy his ing properties
0;Product received for free. This game is a s*it! I get banned permanent because I added mods on singleplayer...I saw hackers when don't get banned and I yes for nothing!Singleplayer 10/10Multiplayer 99999/10Full Game 5/10The company of game 0/10 ( because I getted ban for nothing )
0;The multiplayer experience is fun with friends but when you get transferred to a public lobby with modders... THAT however isn't fun. Got perm banned on both of my accounts because rockstar can't fix their anti cheat measures And support was REALLY helpfull by telling me that my account was permanently banned and couldn't do anything about.Spend your $60 on something else )
0;"""Just don't...The game is riddled with modders who are determined to show off how they can burn you alive make your vehicles explode destroy your cargo cage you remove all your money and then kick you from a session like you're a piece of crap.If you bump into any legit players they'll shoot you in the face before you can even type """"friendly"""". The community is toxic and I suppose this has caused players to kill on sight. Just don't...."""
0;WIth the latest update I felt like I was playing Saints Row 4. The game is still fun but I agree with members of the community when they say the game is not headed in its brightest direction. It seems like the developers mostly want to obtain more money in such a manner that it does not put the players first which is something I cannot stand behind.
0;13/02/2018 Cheaters still exist the hacker killed 3 people behind the mountain including my friend and other guy I didn't have opportunity to watch more it was short but he probably killed more he was shooting throught the mountain and wall and obviously had aim hack nothing has changed after the anti cheat patch of 02/02/2018 always these damn cheaters ruining the game.
0;you Take Two.The only reason I kept playing this game was checking out new mods but I guess you don't care much about your player base. I predict GTA Online will still be infested with cheaters and exploiters (cuz they don't even need OpenIV to do so) but without modding tool for good players that had fun in story mode. you once again Take Two and watch me downloading pirated version of your next game instead of buying it.
0;Singleplayer is Ok not brilliant and for me a dissapointment since i had higher expectations but still OK the Multiplayer on the other hand is horrible. At first it seems pretty cool to play Gta on a big map with other players. But without the bloomy googles it is just not good.If you like long loading screens griefers cheaters and not the ability to fight back since so much is locked behind high levels and even higher prices this is your game.
0;The singleplay in this game is really good. The campaign is ingeniously crafted and well polished.If you're buying the game for the single player ONLY i'd really recommend it. ONLINE on the other hand is not easy to get into. Due to the pay2win aspect of online you won't have a chance to get of the ground. Hackers are everywhere I mean everywhere. Unless you have money to spend on sharkcards or actually time to grind I wouldn't recommend the game.
0;Take Two have this huge community and they have clearly shown that they just don't care about them.The only thing they do care about is the money that is in their pockets.They don't understand that alot of people bought grand theft auto V because of the mods.Hopefully this is a wake up call as they have made the game less fun!
0;Poor Online scheme with Microtransactions down the throat online and now they've destroyed the modding community. Devs need to embrace the modders as it is a MASSIVE selling point to consumers so they can play they game how they like some games have been bought for the modding potential alone.Sad times...
0;Online is still cancer and filled of hackers. And Rockstar is adding more things for poor honest players to grind theyre off They might as well just buy a shark card just to get what they want. And i hate rockstar for that U greedy C*nts I pity the poor.
0;Got banned permanently for TOC without reason... GG SIngle player is 10/10Multiplayer is a 2/10 with a toxic community and ban system filled with hackers on a constant grind fest niceBTW screw take two as they are completely trying to get rid of single player mods gg....
0;I've played this game for 2 years on PC. Great game and the mods are ... oh wait ... ING GONE! My single player graphics mods are gone. Mods is one of the major benefits of PC gaming graphics being another. I can no longer mod the graphics. you TakeTwo ing scum bags. You made a great game we waited for the PC version just to screw us over later down the line because you've made your money right? Well you. Change this now before you reputation is tainted forever if it isn't already.

0;Story Yesterday we reported that the lead developer of OpenIV a modding tool that has allowed the GTA games to be modded for nearly a decade had decided to shut down their mod after receiving a cease and desist from Take Two Interactive publisher of the Grand Theft auto series.http //www.pcgamer.com/heres rockstars statement about take two shutting down gtas openiv modding tool/
0;Worst download servers and update servers.Banned for anyone interacting with a hacker/trainer in the same session as you.Nothing really new after almost a decade of its first release.Imagine playing a game where you're doing your own thing trying to make a few bucks to buy a building or cars.Then someone comes along and kills you over and over again.Then get banned...
0;Take Two Interactive has absolultely ruined one of the best games of all time. The multiplayer has become pay to play and they are trying to stop the entire modding community. They are issuing cease and desist's to every major SINGLE PLAYER modding tool like OPENIV.
0;https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_okTake Two and Rockstar ed over the modding comunity. That is not ok.They said they are not actually gonna do the promised singleplayer DLC because you we made our money from the shark cards.The Singleplayer is good the multiplayer is pay to win microtransaction BS.
0;SP is fun MP is nothing but microtransactions. They've inflated the prices to the point that grinding it out by doing jobs to buy things is impossible. They only care about selling shark cards. Also screw over the mod community. Mod prolong the life of the game lead to more sales. Fools.
0;"""Ok so now you take down OpenIV... a mod which allows people to put hard work into an almost brand new GTA experience that has been running for 10 years just in the hopes more people buy shark cards for your hashed together """"dlc"""" ... go back and remember what GTA was about and go make another game GTA V feels like a game that could have been great online but then you learnt about micro transactions and went nah that we can make $$$$$"""
0;"""It's a great game! But if they are going to make modding """"illegal"""" in this game even if it is only in the singleplayer... Well there goes all offline replayability. Yeah there are hundreds of things you can do after completing the main game but doing the funky wunky weirdy stuff that mods give you that's what GTA is all about."""
0;The gameplay is cool but the coders and hacker have made the game just about unplayable. Yet they will not mention this when you buy it and won't refund you because of it. It's out of control big time. There are in every room on most missions too. Passive mode is ineffective aginst them. I wish I knew before hand.
0;rockstar are a bunch of thieves ban waves going out to make more money i was a day 1 player and never did anything to comprimse my account was my favorite game of all time till i got banned for idk what. then finding out its a bot running around banning people and you cant find out why . . delete ur proggesion of your first offense.... and no chances of disputing it... ty for screwing your valididity over rockstar so saddining... in my opinion find another game to invest in!!
0;Rockstar congrats on letting your publisher take control of your game and ruin the amazing relationship you had with your player base. Cause newsflash closing OpenIV does not stop your terrible Shark Card business plan lack of single player DLC or stop the myriad of multiplayer modders. Also wtf no business stuff in private sessions? What if i dont want my 500 000 dollar shipment blown up by a 14 year old in a jet?
0;11 3 18 and they still can't control the modders. Game has been out for years arbitrary bans still happening everything costs so much shark cards arent even worth it including the $100 one. Good single player ok with friends starts to feel like grinding your against a sodering iron.
0;Single player is a ton of fun. However lack of updates and unfufilled promise of a single player expansion makes for the limited replayablility.Multiplayer/online is an utter toxic pool of acid with the hackers cheaters and griefers. This make Chernobyl seem like a kiddie playground. Grinding is hard enough without those cheats messing with you. After clocking 1200+ hours I've had enough.
0;"""Rockstar originally made the perfect game with mods a great multiplayer system and hundreds of hours fun. But recently they shut down the GTA V singleplayer modding community because (in 'T2' own words) that """"Shark cards microtransactions that give you GTA$ online are not making enough money"""".They shut down the reason most people bought the game to make more money. I'm sorry is the 4TH BEST SELLING GAME OF ALL TIME NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?Also their support team are gibbons."""
0;Online is a grindfest. Forcing you to buy currency. The only good thing about this was Singleplayer and moding it to oblivion. Well they made modding illegal so the only thing that gave replayability to this 3 year old game for still 60 was taken away. GTA V has shown a lot of anti consumer practices buit this was over the line.
0;This game is super fun once you've gotten through all of the grinding and other purposely too expensive t and then once you've finally worked your way up to the very top....you'll get banned for absolutely no reason and you'll lose absolutely all of your progress. If I were you I'd save myself the headache and not get this somewhat ok game from this super super company
0;Got banned for no reason like around 20k+ others apperently. They keep ing up whilst their game is becoming more by the minute. Thank you rockstar for making me waste 710h on this game just to get reset to zero and nice of you to delete the thread about this issue on your forums aswell. Showing how good of a company you are.I used to have huge respect for your company but now your looking like the next EA with a even worse banning system.
0;so far the game is fun. the prices for anything are moronic high sothey want you to buy shark cards. then as it just happens they had an offer for 30% bonus cash for great white and above. but they wont pay out the bonus nor will they give the money drops for live streams like they say they will. so far rock star you are proving to be anti customer greedy bunch of scum
0;Hi everyone. I love this game so much. I completed story mode 3 times so far.But I bought GTA on steam because of GTA Online.I don't know why after 50+hours of gameplay loading times of Mission to Freeroam Freeroam to Mission (Or races heists etc.) screens are SO ****ING MUCH. I MEAN A LOT. This game has so many network bugs. Very unoptimised network. I MEAN VERY VERY VERY ****ING VERY MUCH UNOPTIMISED.Anyway the game you're about to play is Loading Simulator Online.
0;A great Game with awesome story that was abandoned for pure greed.GTA Online Is Pure Garbage filled with tedious Farming and Griefing. All to frustrate you long enough to buy a Fupin Shark Card.I wasted to many houers of my life an this und recomend you to not do the same.If the Story mode interests you than buy it but not for the online mode.
0;after the recent update I'm experiencing high ping than usual. I live in russia but its not connecting me to the russian server where I usually get about 25ms or less. And also there is some problem with inventory dragging stuff( sometimes when i drag from the items on ground the mouse pointer directly goes somewhere weird or like that. FIX IT.
0;"""*This is no more GTA Online This is """"GTA GAMBLING"""" A worldwide casino that are illegal and supposed to be sued.They are no more GAME DEV for me they are just thieves that think they are a """"big SHARK bussines gangstars"""". Developers may consider you as a milking cow! I hope hackers would not stop hack this peace of electronic poker."""
0;Okay story mode. Good open world. Excellent gameplay and graphics. Still a five year old game though. Shouldn't have the full release price tag even if it goes on sale often.Monetization out the in Online. Either grind for hundreds of hours or pay up .Hackers galore and innocent players being banned after having modded money forced upon them.
0;"""Offline is actually okay. But it's absolute toxic in online. It's grinding simulator that mixes with """"get rekt by op flying motorcycles while trying to make some money"""" and you cant even report them there's no point modders all over the place it's a POS of a game the online version."""
0;I do not recommend this game. because you will get suspended for no reason so you can t play for 30 days. and the next time it s permanent. Me and my friends were playing and then I got suspended. And when you get suspended and you will you lose all of your money stuff and your level You have to start all over again. The only reason I would recommend this game is if I get my Rockstar get your ing together. just don't buy this game.
0;Banned for no reason given. Beware. I've spent hundreds of hard earned dollars on the game itself twice and on shark cards to do things the right way and leveled two characters for three years with my friends never bothering anyone to just lose everything and get a random ban without any reason given. I feel robbed by Rockstar. Game is fun especially with friends but not worth it. They're crooks. Spend your money elsewhere. Thanks.
0;pretty good gamejust kidding fu t2 + rg ur liars. im sure that you said that you are totally supporting mods while gta v development stage and now u r making mod completely illegal. gj. hope Everywhere by lenslie benzies will come soon. and ur rdr2 will sell in 2 copies.

0;Infinite time consumer loading screens... After a while it gets so boring and hated... It can make you wait just only to enter the game up to 5 minutes. Just to be able to get into the game 5 minutes! Maybe less or more but it is approximate time. And also not only while entering the game you wait on all loading screens including the finish screens of the mission! Yes all of them! Consider it before buying!
0;So many ...rude people no real teamwork full of hacker/modder and Rockstar just don't give a .infinite loading screen loading time is just insane ..this game doesn't deserve to be sold until rockstar just don't give a about customer.Just a pay to win when you want to do quietly your mission and people harass you with heavy armored plane bombing your face...there is no balance..you have a chance if you're a hacker or a modder or have a credit card dedicated to this game(when it s not crashing)
0;The story mode is great as you would expect from the series. However the online version rarely connects when it does you'll find there are cheaters brazenly roaming free (e.g. in super vehicles that fly through walls and fire explostive rounds). Obligatory bundled cash is worthless it just hikes the price so congratulations Rockstar on tanking your review score.
0;Brief review much like the amount of time GTA online lets me spend in it...Campaign/Singleplayer GoodOnline TrashConnectivity issues? ing of course!First Person DissapointingGraphics(like it matters) Pretty damn goodControls mehSummer sale scandal gfy rockstarVehicles FunPhysics Much better than GTA IVDetailed? Sure let's go with that...Don't really know if I should recommend it or not For the sake of variety I ain't gonna.
0;It's a good game overall with nice single player content (but the SP is basically abandoned now the devs only focus on the MP content to milk it for all it's worth via microtransactions)If you buy this to play multiplayer (heists etc.) make sure to buy 3 additional copies for your friends because if you get together a random group in 30 minutes one of the members will be guaranteed to leave in like 5 minutes.
0;Don't waste your money. Good SP terrible MP.The online community consists out of two types of players. Hackers and Tryhards. The balancing in online is a joke everything is WAAAAY overprized and the general direction in which this game is going is just stupid. Simply don't buy.
0;Never gonna buy Rockstar game again.They keep banning innocent players who grind and grind and grind but dont ban modders and hackers and griefers who interfere in other player's missions and sales.thank you for the fun memories but this 30 day suspension and character reset without giving a legitimate reason is extremely frustrating.useless supoort staff no wonder the rating is on a downfall
0;So i used to love this game. I spent a few hundred at least to try all the dlc etc..Returned to play today after a few month break then get a message saying i am being banned my account is being reset and the decision is final. I dont even know why??? So no i wouldnt recommend this game. I was looking forward to red dead but i think i will save my cash for someone other than rockstar..
0;Great single player however in my opinion the multi player is t that really wants forces you to spend real money on it unless you don't mind hourless grinding to get all the cool items. Still waiting for single player DLC as promised. Turned their back on the mod community on numerous occasions only being saved by the vocal and angry community. Very poor anti cheat. Fun game worth a buy for single player alone but I can't personally recommend this game based off these rationales.
0;The company makes stupid moves in regards to the game. The support is total garbage they recently gutted single player modding which they previously supported the free DLCs (though yes they could charge for them) are just repetitive grind fests that reeks of free to play mobile games that just push micro transactions. This game could be so much more if Take Two and Rockstar weren't so greedy and ham fisted.
0;A wonderful game don't get me wrong. but removing single player mods and hiding behind that decision by claiming it's to help prevent modders in Multiplayer (which for the most part only has mods to combat the shark card fueled pricing structure they've implemented) is outrageous.
0;I like this game it's funny to play lots of things to to and own in multiplayer but in it's current state it's unplayable. It has been overtaken by hackers and the devolopers seem unuble or unwilling to solve the problem. Beware if you are planning to buy this in order to play online. Until something is done your game experience will be ruined!
0;"""GTA V Multiplayer Review + good graphics + good performance + nice missions and """"quests"""" + makes a lot of fun with friends + easy to reach 100+ hours 'cause it's fun + DLC's cars and clothings are too expencive got perma banned because I played with NO mods and hacks #rofl too much hacker and modder game nearly unplayable (they teleport you or even kill you)"""
0;the lamest online system i ever played...for nevv players becareful vvhen you play online ! there is bunch of modders out there they can get you ban from randomly dropping money on you or even simply play vvith them in same lobby and guess vvhat ?R* dont give a 5h!+ to your innocent...i even not bother to gives this game (online) a second chance.
0;These Modders are really annoying for some reason everytime I want to play the game a modder gets on the server and takes me out and when I come back I have a dunce hat and I cant play with my friends. I know you guys are trying to fix red dead redemption but place set some of your team to fix these types of problems it suck that I shed money into this game when it doesn't even allow me to do the thing I bought it for so please so something.
0;GTA is a scam. They make everything stupid expensive and make it practically impossible to make money (with the morons playing the game killing you constantly or the nonsense ways you can lose all your stock or fail a mission) so the only way you can afford anything (even staying alive) is by buying their over priced shark cards.
0;GTA 5 Single player is amazing. Online is okay you meet raging players and modders etc. then you grind mission all day to get money then next day they Update the Game and you don't even have a single mod/cheat you get banned! Fantastic!!!! Sends Request for ban appeal and what do you get? A Automated Reply Nice Game Support.Please buy this game D
0;Usually I would say it is a good game. BUT the developers are doing bad in the last updates... No more MODS everything is getting SUPER expensive and you have to do things in public rooms (so pot heads don't let you do nothing)...You either grind for weeks non stop use hacks (never done myself) or just accepts that you wont be able to buy anything in the game...
0;Sadly although I really want to reccomend this game.. I can't. They have failed time and again to add jelly fish hunting in recent updates. When I learned it hadn't been released in the most recent low riders dlc I was so angry and it was the last straw. Unfortunately i'm going to have to hang up my jelly fishing net yet again.
0;imho milking the cash cow and kicking the fair community in the nuts (first Bethesda now Rockstar it's truly a dark (gamer) world)It's probably time to move on and find other video game publishers who go a reasonable way against cheaters...http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 950724962Translate the comments https //translate.google.com/translate?hl de&amp sl auto&amp tl en&amp u http%3A%2F%2Fsteamcommunity.com%2Fid%2FHolar%2Frecommended%2F271590
0;Wow. So people are getting banned for modding now? Well done rockstar one of the reasons I got this on PC considering I had it on PS4 was for mods and to have fun in singleplayer. To be honest I want my money back and anyone else who has wasted 40 on this should demand a refund as like me you've most likely spent money on the console versions. This is despicable I can understand banning mods in online.. But singleplayer? Wtf..
0;Such a broken online experience. Why they bothered I don't know. They create a bad sport system which means that you get charged 1 17k for blowing up someones car. Yet they create armored cars and tanks that can only be stopped by being blown up. Such a stupid idea spoils what could have been a great game.
0;Game was fun at launch now it's just a money grab to get people to buy in game currency at absurd prices. Economy of the game is inflated beyond playability. Get your together. The development of this game has been pathetic and anyone who has been in a position to make decisions that has led the game to it's current state should be ashamed of themselves for letting it get this bad. Your game is bad and you should feel bad.
0;Riddled with Microtransactions to the point they stopped developing single player content because they had the microtransactions for multiplayer and they can't put them on single player. Also said that they weren't pushing microtransactions enough when they already have a load. Also pretty much banned modding on their games.
0;the story is good the multiplayer is only fun to screw around with freinds in and the devs are complete trash and only care about money. rockstar is a company and have made gta online 100% pay to win with each new dlc a better version of the last so you never have enough weapons to defend yourself unless you want to spend 4hrs a day grinding missions untill rockstar cuts the ammount of money you get from them. i wouldnt reccomend
0;If you want a fun pvp experience don't ing buy this game.If you want to get killed by some that has god mode then sure go ahead and be ed right in the by Rockstar and Take Two Interactive's greed and carelessness for the well being of the game. They won't give a until modding hurts their ing 'shark cards'.Indie devs can handle modders better than this multi billion dollar company.
0;DONT ING BUY THIS PILE OF WANK IF YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY IT TAKES 100 ING HOURS TO GET ANYWHERE OR FOR YOU TO LITERALLY BUY IN GAME CURRENCY AND IF YOU EVEN ATTEMPT TO TRANSPORT CRATES I CAN GUARANTEE THAT 50 ING WILL TRY TO BLOW YOU UP BECAUSE THEY WILL GAIN $20 (in game) FROM IT. IT IS ING INFURIATING HOW YOU CANT EVEN BUY THE CRATES AND DO CEO IN A CLOSED ONLINE SERVER... 3/10 has some redeeming qualities NICE CARS.
0;The game is amazing but hackers have taken over the online mode. Sadly i haven't seen any thing being done about it.The hackers can teleport make cars fly kill all players instantly destroy all cars summon any objects become immortal make money bags rain down on you remove all your weapons mess up your profile so you have to restart the game and more.I am guessing the online mode will die off soon because of this so i do not recommend it if you are interested in that part of the game.
0;"""Beautiful graphics. Amusing story in single player. Online is a cluster of """"don't"""". just don't. Hackers everywhere. Rockstar only cares to sell in game money and connectivity problems will curse you from the moment you try to play. you will wait 10 minutes fo the game to load. 10 minutes for the game to fail to load and then likely another 5 minutes when it shoves you back to single player only to then crash. Buy for the first player game. Do not touch online"""
0;Im leaving a bad review because take two ruin the only game I played. This was the only game that I played and enjoyed modding. I can't believe Take two is doing this and shooting their own partners in the back as well as the Customers that have purchase this game for modding only. it's sad and hopefully this problem can be fixed and the face within take two that came up with the idea of banning mods to get fired. if you read this person that created the idea of banning mods. . you.
0;Take Two has online items overpriced and grinding ridiculous causing you to buy money or hack. And now they're shutting down modding support for single player. This is ridiculous. Don't support this backwards company. We don't have to put up with this!
0;For PC users this game is far from expected . Although graphics are not bad controls versus movement give the player the idea that the character is constantly drunk . I didn t like and I regret to have spent money on this ... I wish I could get refund .
0;The gameplay itself was great but rockstar probably don't care about the online gameplay experience.rockstar probably screw up with the entire masterpiece with this.(*btw adding some new online sh**/overrated cars rather than update the server is really helping)
0;Base game was fun but the online community is garbage. Every lobby is full of cheaters griefers and the whole gamut of jerks. Rockstar constantly milks the player base for money with outrageously priced in game items that you can conveniently purchase with real money if you want to compete and have nice things. Avoid this like heroin you don't need it in your life.
0;Story mode is good but the Online is terrible. Mainly the cops in here being Terminators and since i last played awhile back if you don't hide in a tunnel you get 50 cops dropped right on you and killed. And this happens when you sneeze the wrong way. When i first played it was bad. Since i played again recently its terrible. There is challenge then there is just a middle finger to the players.
0;I paid $120 dollars for this game a copy for my Playstation 3 and a copy here on Steam. I love this game. I love being able to play this game.However I can't play this game. Why? BECAUSE IT IS CODED BY NEWBORN BABIES WITH SEVERE MENTAL RETARDATION. If it's not the servers being unavailable for me it's random crashing. If it isn't a hacker killing me over and over again it's random crashing. If it isn't random crashing it's random crashing.I'd love to be able to play this game. Thanks.
0;Grand Theft Auto V is a fantastic single player experience that Rockstar has opted to mostly neglect in post release support and content. Rather all and any updates are in service of Grand Theft Auto Online one of the worst multiplayer components I ve ever seen.
0;Since they have taken an anti modding stance I would no longer reccomend this title nor it's affiliated companies and publishers. The war on modding only hurts the community and pushes people away from the game and kills replayability. SHARK CARDS SHARK CARDS THATS ALL THAT MATTERS. Is the message I am getting from this.
0;"I don't think developers have earned the right to ban you for stumbling into glitches when YOU'RE TESTING their early access game. As for the ""stream sniping/honking"" bans that doesn't even deserve a thorough explanation it's just blatantly despicable.Even though I continue to play the game doesn't mean I support developer practices and the only way to have a meaningful opinion to a titanic sales success is to leave a negative review in hopes of a financial impact."
0;I spens $30CAD of real money on in game cash bought a buissnes spent time getting it supplies and manufacturing product. Come back on the next day it is gone and rockstar ignores me. The games multi player is also just loading screens so many loading screens. Then one person rages because they didnt like the settings hoast launched with and back to loading. games cool but in design it is a wast of time.
0;Was a great game Screwed over by Take Two and there anti modding policy trying to shove the Microtrnsactions down the throat of the player who doesnt care about multiplayer and just wants to cruise around in a cool car causing havok offline.If this stands I will not buy a game done by Take Two again.
0;"""Holy ing grind. Annoying missions which take far too long to completeonly way to get money quick is to spend atleast 2000 on """"micro""""transactions(Or hack which seems more ethical)Slow in releasing insanely expensive vehiclesEverybody hacks. they don't do about it."""
0;This game only changes for the worse.Online has very big prices for everything in attempt to make us buy shark cards.Single player had openIV witch was great modding tool but take two took it down.Single player still has great story and is fun to play.
0;"""Play for hoursDecide to invest in stock marketBuys a ton of sharesGo to my portfolio""""No shares avaleable""""Money gone10/10Apprently its been a bug forever but rockstar is not doing about it. You'd think after making PC users wait so long they'd at least fix a bug THIS BIG.Horrible."""
0;Love the game but I waited so long for this to come out on PC to experience it and as well the awesome mods that would follow only to hear that Rockstar changed their EULA to forbid mods in singleplayer and multiplayer regardless of what the mod does. I still enjoy the game but a huge fun factor of having it on PC has been taken away.
0;Just along for the ride. To be completely honest however they probably could've stopped online hacking some other way. I get what they're trying to do but at the same time they also inhibited modding in the single player campaign too which was a HUGE draw for many players who had already played the game but bought for PC regardless.
0;You know this used to be a good game. If you're looking for a good story line to play the would be good. But if you're looking for the online experience save yourself $60 and don't buy this. Hackers are running rampant through every server out there and no one is immune (except the hackers themself).If you buy it it's your own online funeral.
0;Just like the other reviews I was banned for nothing and was reset back to lvl 1 with nothing. I also can't play online with friends for 30 days which is idiotic. It frustrates me to see that a company can do this to people who are wrongfully accused of modding.

0;so when this game came out i absolutley loved it... but then the lowrider dlc happened.......... and everything after that just kept getting more and more EXPENSIVE........ yet all the payouts were the same... now you either have to commit your soul to the game or your wallet... in order for it to be enjoyable.. not to mention the atrocious prices for in game currency... all i gotta say isROCKSTAR i thought you were better than this.....Sincerly a fan that has been loyal since day 1.......
0;super glitchy social club interface it's cool i can deal with it. rediculous pay to win eh I can just not buy it. Get's banned from gta 5 with no explaination well I guess the developers don't want people to play the game they bought. Oh and Take Two hate mods.
0;They had almost 2 years of extra time to make the pc version but did they manage to make a working game? NO!It's riddled with bugs and it will only work in periods of time. Tried to contact Rockstar support but no help from them.You can't mod it either without getting banned...
0;The game installs fine. I have an Asus P8Z77 I7 Nvida GTX780 16GB SSD and play's fine. After some progress i got stuck on all player characters with crossings where cars float and then the program freezes. The ticket at R* is open for 10 days without any reply. Online i also received an ban with others and R* is not allowed to tell me why. They can reply to that. The game is unplayable and problems get not acknowledged or solved. I regred my purchase.
0;Before i rant i want to say that the singleplayer element of this game is amazing but this review is mainly on the mp.In my experiences in mp everytime it has be unfun and annoying. the playerbase is unfriendly the system unfriendly to people that arent good or noobs and it discourages me and other people from playing it. Everytime I open it I expect fun and instead I get pain. So goodbye and fairwell.
0;Alright Rockstar did you think banning everyone all of a sudden was a good idea? The is wrong with you absolute bantermen?I was having a gentleman like sniper shootout with one fine random fellow and the next thing I know is that I am getting banned for a month and getting my character reset.Absolutely ridiculous Rockstar. Shame on you.
0;"""GTAO get one whiny little twit reporting you for """"exploiting"""" because they can't snipe with a shotgun from a block away (LOGIC!). Get banned 3 months. Come back tons of scripters mass killing people getting tons of reports against them and they don't get anything. Try to dispute a ban with R*? they don't respond at ALL. I got an unfair ban nearly a YEAR AGO. STILL waiting for a """"reply""""."""
0;If you dont own this game yet your profile is lolI know your games STAR ( your adversery mode and 2xrp 2xmoney)The game is deadIf youre waitin for GTA 6 youre a dumbass foolget this damn game and play it you dont have any chance btw bring a bad comment after you own this
0;I really liked this game at first the online was fun to play with friends. Then the ingame prices for new content started skyrocketing while the ability to make money didn't go up very much. What was already a grind required even more grinding. Doing the same missions over and over again for a pittance while each new DLC cost more and more. It's fun for a bit but gets old fast.
0;Everytime I play I'm match with incompitent rice s from across the globe or 12 year olds. Not to mention the thousands of players that constantly quit halfway through missions or heists or are simply on this game to troll and be f****** idiots. I'f you want a game with a good gaming community this is not what you are looking for anyone agree?
0;Please please please do not buy this game to play online. I just installed the game after a year long hiatus and got banned 2 hours after logging in. I have never used any mods or altered any of the files and was on a 100% fresh install. The banning process takes around 2 hours to ban you so you will not be able to get a refund. Rockstar completely stonewalls people who try to appeal their bans as well. Story mode is fine but do not buy this to play GTA Online.
0;This is a pretty cool game dont get me wrong.. but rockstar really has to do something about the cheaters. they are everywhere and i mean it...Besides that the new update kinda suck it adds really stupid stuff in my own opion they dont belong in gta but it. i dont care that much about that. Just burn and throw the cheaters to the river.
0;The loading screens are long and they happen way too much its always P2P connection so you'll get disconnected a lot and the cummunity is horrible.Thats why you need to play with friends and then you can put a lot of hours into the game.EDIT Take Two are pushing GTA down the drain mods made the game more fun. Now you'll get sued for it or something.
0;Buy this game if you are looking for a nice offline story mode.However if you are looking for a game to play online with your friends DO NOT buy this game.People get banned for no reason and there is no possibility to appeal on the decision.Rockstar people don't care about you once they get your hard earned money.Corporate mindset at its best. I hope to have helped anyone deciding whether to buy this game or not.Have an awesome day! D
0;I was suspended form GTA V ONLINE 1 month for no reason and staff never check it i try to contact Rock Star support but they didn't help me maybe just Rock Star just random suspended and let cheater play i found many cheater still can play game but i can't play it now...
0;Micro transaction ridden hellhole of a multiplayer story is the only good part about this game and that got abandoned quickly. Then they decide to file a lawsuit against a group of modders who aim to make the singleplayer more fun with mods. If this is what we can expect from Rockstar with Red Dead 2 then I am worried and deeply ashamed at them for this type of behaviour.
0;"""Between the online just being a complete grindfest with no real fun behind it other than """"grind 100 missions for a single item"""" and the singleplayer's modding scene just being killed by a C&amp D in a single night..There's no reason to buy this game anymore. At all."""
0;This game had put me into countless hours of wait and grinding. that half the time wasn't enjoyable and the other half was me waiting for a session to load. The game is cool until you get blown up over and over again by some boy in his insurgent having a nerdgasim on the mic half the time the fights that you encounter are just straight rpgs miniguns or spawn kills with snipers. not recommended
0;This game if the most fun pile of Sh!t I have ever played. Multiplayer is so addictivly frustrating to play with its volatile hacker communtity.(all my hours are from multiplayer) And yet I still find my self playing this game every friday night with my buddys.
0;I personally don't give a about the mod removal since I only play online anyway and never modded offline but I can understand that it's a pain in the to some. So if doing as little as giving a negative recommendation helps out those who are struck by T2's plans then sure have a negative review.When it comes to the actual game 8/10 preddy gud.
0;this is a pretty nice game with a story that has tons of replayabilty to it and mods to add to it to longer your time on it for many many hours the multiplayer can be a blast when you're not in a lobby with hackers JUST IN im getting a report that HUH? they made it so you cant mod?? are they on crack?? dont buy this game until they bring back mods if you already haven't got it.
0;Decently fun game. However it has a few optimization issues with stuttering texture/world loading and it's obviously a console port.Cons Rockstar is apparently a pretty evil company when it comes to how they treat their customers. Support is few and far between and personally the game isn't THAT good as to where I'd recommend it to anyone.
0;Singleplayer was great but since recently the game's publisher showed us that modding is at risk so if you want to mod the game then don't buy also TAKE TWOMultiplayer is still ok but is steadily getting worse and worse when the new updates require more and more ingame money eventually making you buy shark cards with real money also TAKE TWO
0;rockstar is greedy af. they try to make you pay 100$ for 8 mil of fake money. i definitely didnt cheat to get 10 times that for free. on the other hand this game has made my chest hurt for days because of how hard i was laughing playing this with friends. almost worth the 60$.
0;I would suggest this game except for the fact that the parent company of Rockstar TakeTwo has decided to take a greedy route in hopes of making more money! These negative reviews are NOT trolls I highly discourage buying this game until TakeTwo fixes their crap!
0;I loved this game and bought it when it first came out for xbox and when i got my pc i bought it again. A lot of this hours were spent playing with friends and having hilarious times. Now due to the modding tool being removed it killed me since i had goals to begin modding. 0/10
0;No just no. You do not pull Single Player modding support just because the greedy corporation need to shift people into the Online experience and have them buy DLC MONEY FOR OVERPRICED CONTENT! I am done with Rockstart. Keep your Red Read Redemption Max Payne and GTA.
0;The singleplayer has quite a few minor issues that get annoying but ignoring those its one of the best open world games out there.The online mode is terrible. Cheaters everywhere you get banned for using mods in singleplayer 50% of the time your loading. Dont get this game for the online mode get it for the single player.Also Rockstar social club sucks.
0;you Take Two. you for complaining that you're not making enough money from us despite selling the game three times and totally unbalancing the GTA Online economy. you for attacking singleplayer just to push people onto the worse part of the game just so you can rinse us of cash. you and your business practices to Hell.
0;Got temporally banned and Rockstar didnt even state what for. I didnt even do anything wrong and the worst part is you cant appeal your ban and when I can play again all of my property and inventory will be gone as some t punishment for getting banned.
0;Got Perma banned because of modders griefing us. Rockstar support do nothing and treat inoccent players as trash. looks like im going to have to experement with mods to make the dull singleplayer story fun again.Edit Take 2 just essentially removed modding from GTA 5 so yeah. you Rockstar and Take 2. Never buying your games again.
0;"""the story mode is great i loved it. The online version is worst full of modder bug glitch everywhere hacker. Not a good experience. Server issue everytime got kicked to sp out of nowhere cant even join in a lobby and of course the loading screen. """"cloud simulator"""". It take ages to load me into a single game."""
0;"""Play the game since it came out in 2013 Have 400+ hrs on pc and 600+ on console Never hack cheat or mod Have a high level character with heaps of cars pegasus vehicles properties businesses etc Dont log on for about 3 weeks Log on """"your account has been suspended for 30 days also your character will be reset"""" How to lose your whole fanbase 101Lick my nuts rockstar sincerely everyone who got banned for no reason. ./ /) .. / ../ ./ ./ ./ / / ./ / / ./ ./ ..( ( . / ) .. ../ . . _. ..( .. ."""
0;I played this game for over 800 hours and was happy to play more in the future even though rockstar ed all the PC players with the release of the game. Of the 800 hours I have in the game maybe 50 is spent playing online with my friend where I had no mods installed. The 750 other hours were spent on the campain and modding the game and I am prittey sure that this is the case for many other PC players and now rockstar just killed the modding comunity.
0;Instead of fixing their anti cheat system for online play they decided to ban all modding for single play.I bought TWO copies of this game. One on playstation and one on PC so I can enjoy the benefits on PC and you decide to give me this https //zerolives.com/article/vIpXOHnx/grand theft auto v steam listing flooded with negative reviews following modding tool cease and desist
0;ur ban happy anticheat bot ffs. i used infitity to cheat in singleplayer and accidentaly left it running while going to online and got banned for it and they deleted my characters that i understand i left it running and got banned bechause of it but when i got unbanned i went back to online and made a new character. the next in day i was permanently banned on the same account and i didnt cheat or do anything else than making a character and going to sleep. dafuq rockstar fix ur bot ffs
0;Honestly it is a good game but I won't recommend this game because of the awful banned system and the service . They will ban your account even though you are a rule abiding gamer and you can never anticipate to get any useful reply coz all mails you received are sent by robot!!
0;would not recommend buying any gta rockstar or take two interactive games or stock in the future they say 99% of players do not cheat so they must hire a whole lotta racists to be admins in there games. along with just about every fps game nowthey could spend some of the hundreds of millions they rip people off to get on admins but theyd rather tell you to go do something to yourself literally if the support people think you insult them after they lie to you...
0;GTA V is fairly good as long as you're playing the singleplayer story but after you're done with that Take Two's recent actions against OpenIV and the rampant cheating online has made this game lose quite a lot of its value and fun over the last few years.
0;"""just one thing that the game had to have and they seem to have forgotten Option to disable Auto Center Cam.The game makes driving one of the most challegings things in the game just because every time you put the cammera in a good position after the games resets it to position """"half car half sky viem"""" its one of the most common asked feature to be able to disable.Avoid anger not buying the game till """"auto center on/off"""" get implemented."""
0;PC gamers gave Rockstar the fame and the name out there as good developer back in the 90s. As time went on they only care about the console players. I bought this game 1 year after xbox one release. ( full price to) They promised alot more heists but that didnt happend. And mulitplayer are kidna fukked now to. I will never buy a game from Rockstar again! Greedy bastards!
0;Worst match making system ever made. It can take up to half an hour or over just to get enough players to be able to even start one of the main online missions. If you work for on a mission for an hour and a player leaves right before it finishes Rockstar forces you to start the mission all over and this happens all the time so I gave up. DONT BUY THIS GAME
0;Spent the past 2 weeks trying to login. first socialclub rejected my CD key even though it was already registered since the beginning of this year then it said I have no internet connection... after logging my account in!60 000 players online? People are passing up buying other good and stable online games for this? for a perpetual loading screen simulator?
0;"""Getting suspended for a month and they're wiping my character that I spent FIVE YEARS working on. I was falsley reported and suspended by a group of s. So just remember that you can get banned for """"modding"""" when you've never even had a client on your game ever."""
0;The things that I liked about GTA 4 were not present in GTA 5 a serious and meaningful story. GTA 5 had shallow characters and boring single player that forced a (unexciting) co op aspect. And the controls are an absolute mess trying to to shoot or even move in this game is horrendous.And GTA Online is just a mess.In short GTA 5 is just a worse Saints Row.
0;Seriously Rockstar it's been a long time it's a problem and you don't fix it. Why in hell is there so many modders?! Can't even play the game in the arena mod because you guys still let them abuse the game when it doesn't go their way. I was about done with GTA I came back and the update is amazing but this issue ruins everything.
0;I love this game but it gets boring over time.You spend too much time playing for few dollars.From the beginning there was a lot of hackers and that got fixed over time.I was banned once for a month for literally nothing if hacker spawns on you and gives you money they ban you also and you can't stop it.I'd like to recommend this game because its fun but I can't sorry Rockstar games.
0;60$ for a game this old? Don't waste your money. The single player campaign is great plenty to do but this loses it's luster in multiplayer.Not recommending because of the multiplayer being full of hackers/modders.After so long I decided to re install and give it a shot multiplayer is still plagued by hackers running around in god mode you might be able to find a session without a hacker but it doesn't last long.
0;I loved this game the multiplayer was good the mods were amazing.More than half of my playtime is actually just messing around in singleplayer with mods.I don't want to give a negative review but if Take Two feels like this is the road to go down then be my guest.
0;DO NOT buy this game. This game is a scam. The game barely functions and Rockstar will never fix it. The entire game is designed to squeeze every bit of money out of you by trying to get you to pay real money for in game money. You would be better off paying someone $60 to kick you in the nuts.
0;online is still glitchy. after some hiests and games all my ammo will be gone requiring for me to spend nearly $200 000 for it all to be back. and it tried charging me twice for hiest setup costs. been over 3 years and they still dont have their sh!t together.
0;Play with hackers the MMO experience. Multiplayer anticheat is completely broken probably design to keep people buying copies of the game. Completely t experience I tried again and again to get into it but I cannot remember the last time I played a multiplayer game without having at least one person running mods.Solo is the only playable option and an overall enjoyable gaming experience.
0;It was fun at launch but the online now s itself out on Shark cards that it wants you to buy. That alone makes it not fun and worthy of a downvote but all these reports of unexplained bans with no word from Rockstar support is just plain unacceptable.
0;After some hundred hours of playing even the online mode gets boring. I mainly play in a private session with my friends but after time it gets old.Everything is expensive I've already bought the most expensive assets through grinding mind you and the payoff is... even more expensive stuff. If you've never played the game then sure play the single player portion other than that NO.
0;Good and funn game just expect Loss of ingame money due to not working purchases for supplys in your bunker (you pay them but they do not arrive) If you get Kicked or loos connection just in the time after a Mission completion (when the Mission Info is still visible) you loose your goods and do not get any money. Ah and you get a message that it is bad sports to leave during the mission even when you not leave by your own will. Continously get killd by other players
0;One of the best single player action games out there overshadowed by one of the worst ( if not THE worst ) pay to win online compents in modern gaming history. Not to mention accounts being banned for being in the same lobby as a mod user or cheater. Yes this game old news now but it is something to think about considering future Rockstar games.
0;Do the developers of this game have some kind of a cuckold fetish as it sometimes feels like getting massivelly cuckolded playing this game.Why the heck do you need to open so many different menus just to set up a race? And why are there these ridiculous time limits on your own playlists that you've created for you and your friends to play? For example a et invite time limit and choosing your car time limit .
0;The game was great and the online part is still great but T2 got greedy and tottaly ruined the modding comunity of this game. F*U Take2....................../ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...')......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...
0;I am a big fan of GTA V but after launch rockstar has blatantly begun shunning all aspects of maintaining their game for playablity. Online sessions contain hackers 95% of the time.You will be aimbotted teleported cars thrown inside of you you'll be able to do everything except play the game you paid for! Thanks Rockstar!When you release GTA 6 please take another route and fire whoever was on quality for ingame security and best practices you think at this level you hired an art major LOL
0;So I got banned the first time for actually cheating but i got perm banned for no reason the second time wtf like thats 1097 hours wasted on a game that i put so much time into lmaomy previous review was i recomended it but i didnt even do anything to get banned this time
0;Really cool game shame my computer blue screens a lot on itScrap that (old review)Game ruined now no more mods in SINGLEPLAYER??!?!?!!?Really rockstar? Bannung OpenIV?Not worth the money now just turned into PS4/Xbox one version as no more Singleplayer mods the reason probably half the people bought the PC version for.
0;This game sucks cos of the amount of glitches there is in the game. i played 5 cargo mission that requires to be delivered by plane and i completed them but it say on the screen that i did not complete it i then proceed to spend the rest 30 mins to try and clear the mission but after the 30 min it just say mission fail. i even try contacting rockstar for this but they did not even want to reply. In conclusion THIS GAME AND ITS HELPDESK.
0;Money grab. want enything nice. either grind a s*** ton like who knows 220 hours.Modder joins server.Rockstart just like yeer this guy need to be pull back to square one just by a modder joining the server.buy money or reset. never play online without friends only or invite only.
0;Just let us mod in online play... think of how great the game would be if you didnt have to spend 40+ game time hours to buy a car. 90% of my time played was when you could mod boy were those the days. Now I log on for maybe 30 minutes and get bored because it's just too grindy and the loading screens are minutes long. has that potential to be a great game but falls short now.
0;Did you guys really have to go out and ruin a great game? If you want people to care about your game you need to properly allow modding and that includes modding over multiplayer. Just add a system that restricts you from modding on public servers but allows it for private games. Boom problem solved
0;Amazing single player.... just a shame that Online is a former shell of what it used to be....If you buy this game buy it for the single player and the mods. DO NOT buy the Shark Cards. I gave up on them years ago. This is a pay to win economy at its worst.This is what you get for treating your customers like Take Two....
0;I liked the multiplayer of this game in the beginning but after the microtransactions that has mostly turned into logging and then running from tanks. So i turned to modding which worked great for the game and i have had hours of fun in that and it seems like that's going away too. So not much left for this game...
0;810 hours of playing GTA V Modded in singleplayer over 30 add on packs Mario player models custom cars fun maps... All of that is now NULL because TakeTwo is a horrible company and is now saying modding is illegal not online hacking singleplayer modding. They just want more and more people to buy their shark cards taketwo.
0;The Single player is a 3/5. Maybe if there was any amount of replay value it would be a 4/5. GTA Online is a complete waste of time. Rockstar has created a worthless in game economy. They deflate the value of their currency by effectively injecting money into the game via Shark Cards. It's the end of an era where Rockstar has demolished the potential of their future products. I personally will never spend another dollar on a Rockstar game.
0;Today I was place in the bad sport lobby. the game said that I was cheating. What the ? In the ten mintues that I was in the lobby there was a large percentage of people who were saying that they didn't belong there. I have never cheated ever in this game. Unlike the ton of players that mod this stupid ing game. Its a complete show. Rockstar can't prevent anyone from cheating but places innocent people in the bad sport lobby for no ing reason. Complete waste of time and money.
0;WTF with this game... after prologue mission now im stuck at franklin 1st mision.. game keep crash when driving a car.. i try some from other guide to fix still not work and some guide i not understand.. from what i see this is common error from 2year ago but still not fix.. 9hr playtime is a joke most is from gta5 online loading too long and verify the game...
0;You know you can literally go yourself Take Two interactive. you and all that you ing stand for you worthless piece of ing you.By banning modding from GTA V you're not only ing yourself over in the future thing is you dont ing realise that this will take ALL your PC Consumers out of your ing playerbase over 200 000 of them. You ing !Also i do not care if my comment is offensive to either Steam Valve nor T2I ing no care.
0;Do not buy this game.Rockstar has changed how they ban hackers. Hackers can teleport next to you drop money on you and teleport away. the ban algorithm will count it as your player hacked and BAN for you. It was good before but now the online is just the stomping ground for griefiers becuase of this new ban system.
0;Don't buy unless you want to beta test broken product.update looking at the patch notes on test server version 1.0 wont bring substantial bug fixes on the table only adding more bugs rather than fixing old bugs. new feature climbing objects! Oh Whoopie Doo.
0;disgusting game online is despicible modders updates are just ways for you to extra for a 3 year old game for 80 dollars to buy overpriced imaginary virtual money. just because cancerous youtubers scream at it when they play so do not buy it even if you have to
0;Good singleplayer gameplay but multiplayer coz ing slow loading time and A LOT OF CHEATERS AND GRIEFERSI WAS FLAGGED AS BAD SPORT BCOZ I WAS DESTROYING GRIEFER'S OPPRESOR ?WHAT THE ROCKSTAR ITS NOT FAIR !HE DESTROYED MY KURUMA AND I WAS FLAGGED BAD SPORT BCOZ I DESTROYED HIS OPPRESOR AND HE DIDNT GET FLAGGED ?
0;"""I can only say that this game is a sh*t in online mode. There are so many stup*d people who loves to ruin other peoples game by constantly kill them. Other problem is the modders who can get really annoying sometimes.Also the story mode is boring as sh*t. The only thing that I like in the game is the fact that you can create your character and do whatever you want in online mode.""""I don t know why this game costs so much""""."""
0;there's so many ing hackers this game is literally unplayable. the single player sucks because you use three characters. getting money in online is too hard. if you earn too much through legitamite means it just rejects it. you are forced to buy there shark cards just to get enough money for daily expenses.
0;WE WANT TO MOD GRAND THEFT AUTO TAKE TWO. PULL YOUR HEADS OUT OF OUR GAPING HOLE AND REALIZE THAT. +1ing the Take Two boycott. Damn I really wanted to play the new Red Dead as well as the new Borderlands but I won t support these type of decisions made by any company no matter what.
0;This game used to be fun. I even preordered it and got to about lvl 100 had an apartement cars etc. But now it just resettet my whole money apartement and generally all I've achieved during 1 year of GTA. The support sucks and I see no other way to reclaim my lvls money etc...
0;I spent the better part of several weeks helping my friend deliver cargo boxes. At the end of it we sold them all and he got $2 500 000 I got $8 000. He wanted to give me a cut but the game wouldnt let him suffice it to say I have lost interest in the game and going on to play better things.
0;A previously acceptable game ruined by pushing a lower quality experience. Gameplay has become worse since release and continues to death spiral. As long as in game transactions greedily drain content quality the integrity of the brand is comprimised.
0;great game but dont put money in the online part casue you can get banned for just play the game or just being in a lobby with a modder really good game design you got their rockstar you ing s. i have put over 300 hours in this game never had mod or cheated once and just two day ago i got banned for no reason
0;Servers are hardly ever working for me and I've had a lot of problems with optimizing this game. I can only recommend this game to people that are willing to spend lots of time and possibly money to try and figure out how to fix the game. Which could be worth it considering the circumstances but in my opinion it isn't.
0;pos game they need to think of people that are not hackers and want to play the game online right fyi there is no way to start an game and make money so your either going to wait till someone gives you the money (hacks) or you have to make friends that have (hacked to give you money from group missions. are go there is no point to play this game if 1 your alone and want to make an group of friends or if your starting in an group and have no hackers in z group.
0;Money farm money farm new update rip money. Repeat. Totally useless updates without any individual idea. Every new stuff is incredibly expensive. When you want to sell your products it's often buggy after that you farmed supplies for hours or if you are just unlucky an idiot destroys your product by fun for 5k in game dollars.. Connection issues everyday. This GTA is not that GTA we want to play.
0;Do NOT buy if you plan on modding singleplayer Take Two forced the creators of the biggest modding tool OpenIV to quit their work and stop all distribution of their tool which is practically essential to mod this game. Read more http //gtaforums.com/topic/889348 openiv/If you buy it enjoy your vanilla singleplayer.

0;People preferred it when the hackers ran rampant handing out ridiculous amounts of in game currency. An ironic spin on a heist game inundated with real world microtransactions at every corner. Great concept at launch that's been milked to oblivion. Buy your way to the top with real money! Due to it's success expect more of this in the next GTA title. Solid campaign. Multiplayer could have been way more than it ended up being.
0;Just played the game a few weeks before they banned me. According to rockstar i did something wrong and they cant tell me what. I have not modded cheated or given players grief... They will altso reset my progress so the past few weeks of gaming will be for nothing... I would not Buy this game again. Rockstar does NOT care about the costumers...ive sadly seen many posts like this one...Banning of new clean players without appeal....
0;Free roam gunplay used to be quite well balanced with the exception of Hydras being overpowered. Now with gunrunning Hydras are useless due to explosive sniping and combat in general is extremely unbalanced. I'm out.Also hackers run rampant. People get banned for no reason.New DLC is just money grubbing. off R*
0;Single player was alright but has basically been abandoned. Multiplayer is a hack fest with an economy purposely broken to promote micro transactions. Its hard to believe the same people that made Vice City are responsible for this mess of a game. I completed Vice City and all I got was a lousy t shirt. Now they want to take the shirt off my back.
0;UPDATE Rockstar has announced that they will not release Singleplayer DLC anymoreBuy this game ONLY if you want to enjoy the Story Mode. Don't buy if you want to enjoy Online Mode it sucks and lot of hackers playing around. Want to play Online? Go grab your console.And most importantly DON'T BUY SHARK CARDS! Yea it's good and fastest way to earn money but it'll become useless if you banned (innocently)
0;Product received for free. Rockstar are fraudsters because they want money money and money for Shark Cards. The Shark Cards are too expensive for 100 USD you get 8.000.000 that is nothing in the game. For 8.000.000 you can buy apartment 2 3 better cars and maybe facility or something like that. That does not worth 100 USD. They are hungry for money. You can give 5 USD to a modder he will probably give you like 1.000.000.000 GTA Dollars. Never give money to Rockstar Games! Shame!
0;Great game ruined by the massive amount of 13 year old cheaters. I would not reccomend buying the game at this time because it is very hard to find a good session without cheaters blowing you up constantly and messing up your game character etc. This review will be changed if Rockstar gets off their bums and actually does something about it.
0;I Don't Support Rockstar's Customer Support and how they handle things. They need to get their heads out of their gloryholes and get to work on doing things right again. This is my only purchase from Rockstar and I barely even play it anymore and mostly use it for some Fun Senarios with friends and that's it. Singleplayer Great. Online Friends only if you have em.
0;Product received for free. The game itself is not optimized. It is PAY TO WIN. And this game got so many modders going around trolling others. And the DLC? boring af and we should pay a lot of money to be ing rich in GTA V. you rockstar!!! Do I recommend this I recommend you to watch instead of playing this Once again this GAME don't waste your time playing GTA V.
0;I was wrongfully banned. Before picking up this game I read reviews like this one thinking I'd be safe from a wrongful ban. I was wrong. I never once used the chat or harassed or bullied anyone. I never griefed exploited or hacked the game or players in anyway. I afked one night to get some cash and bam. My account and all its progress gone. Don't get GTAV. Please.
0;Publishers really need to get with the times. It seems like they want to get as much money as they can without showing their fan base love. Let this be a warning to devs and publishers alike keep in touch with our fans. T2 actions should not go unnoticed.
0;I've played every GTA game since the first one. GTA online sucks. The modders and cheats are impossible to escape. Reload the game and join another GTA online session and there will be different modders god moding spawning jets killing everyone on the map simultaneously. I paid good money for this product and I feel that Rockstar isn't holding up their end. Fix it
0;Eror code 202 no fix available. DMZ port forwarding updating files verifying cache disabling firewall disabling Anti virus DNS settings flush DNS net sh fix etc. Tried it all. To no avail. After almost 500 hours I get screwed like this. Please DM me for a fix. Cant even ing login to your website it won't even ing load.
0;"""Online Good if you have buddies to play with. Terrible if you don't.Offline story mode Quite good and with modding this game is quite replayable due to the amount of mods online. I would rate it """"not recommended"""" though as the online aspect is really quite bad. Also this game has long loading times especially for online play.Update After the mod fiasco there's no guarantee that mods will be very much supported by the developer so do take note."""
0;Enjoyable but such a game rock star does everything they possibly can to try and get you to pay money in game characters constantly calling to get you to buy things that are way to expensive to get all of them they somehow er up so bad to make free mode pay to win its just ridiculous plus rock star doesn't give a about hackers unless they are making money
0;I have only recently just chosen to install this game once more give it another chance basically. And what happened? After standing outside of a store in game for about 5 minutes a black screen shows up saying I am BANNED for a month no reason at all! Completely out of the blue I contact Rockstar games and they just give me a non answer saying they will not undo the ban! Screw rockstar games and this pathetic cash grab of a game Im done with rockstar games and any of their future games.
0;Add me to the list of countless others that recieved a 30 day suspension on GTA online for no reason. Barely had the game for 24 hours and filing a ban appeal LITERALLY does nothing.I'm sure the single player is fun and all but I only bought this to play with friends online. I thought Rockstar cared about thier customers but I now view them as just a bad as EA except I've never been falsely banned from an EA title.
0;"""After spending almost all of my time in Single Player messing around with mods (which after story is the only interesting thing to do) Take Two after selling 80 million+ copies says they're """"undermonetizing"""" and then destroys all mods. Was a fun game and the story was enjoyable online can be cancer"""
0;can't believe that using a trainer in single player offline could effect your online stats to the point of unplayable. devs said they can't fix it. really? it's your server and you cant do anything about it? the first time i bought an original copy of GTA and i wont buy another just because of the crap support and coding.
0;Steaming pile of They flushed 9 months down the drain delaying the release of the PC version. They had AMPLE time to make the game playable on a keyboard and mouse... But it's... Unplayable. Swimming is a disaster. Submersibles helicopters? Is this a joke? I want a refund and a written apology from the in bred deformed FAS baby who allowed this game to be released in this form. Absolute mockery.
0;It's a great game better with mods and an amazing modding community!Modding communityModding communitModding communiModding communModding commuModding commModding comModding coModding cModdingModding inModding in GTAModding in GTA OnlinePlease ing fix your rockstar. You aren't even trying.
0;"""I'm going to be straight up honest this game is complete t. I got banned for having a mod menu so I could have fun on Single player/ Story mode I did not even try to activate the Mod Menu online. They banned me for having a mod menu and having fun on story mode. DO NOT BUY. It says in the """"agreements"""" article that you cannot appeal a ban or suspension."""
0;joined online.. 5 seconds later get run over by a car respawned... shot death by another 12 year old playerrespawned player in jet shot me death...respawned tried to hide is ls customs.... player waiting at me outside so he can kill me...Deleted this piece of game...
0;Overall a nice and fun game to play. But full of bugs and sometimes doesn't even work. Rockstar scams you you open a support ticket and an automatic bot answers and after that nothing will happen. There is no support basically. I recommend this game if u dont care about bugs and hackers and that it sometimes doesn't even work.
0;Please bring the OLD GTA 5 BACK! Man Rockstar you really ed up what was an almost perfect game. iFruit app is not recognizing my license plate I cannot set up a heist myself (the game will crash) and there are still a 32902930428350923852094358240958240 modders out there. You tried to fix a problem but created a 1000000000 more. F*CK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY!
0;This game is badass. It looks so much better than next gen especially with the higher graphics option. Though I was definetly a bit hesitant buying the game for a third time I feel it was definetly worth it. But I dont reccomend buying it during the sale. R* decided to raise the price to $80.00 ($79.98) forcing you to buy a DLC along with the game keeping it at the base price of the game.
0;if you want gta play san andreasexcept rockstar is a piece of and ruined the steam version as well so pirate a 1.0 versionif you want saints row with microtransactions and developers that decide that modding is illegal and sue modders get thishowever i can not recommend it
0;I RATE THIS 9/11 ! THIS GAME GAVE ME CANCER !!! WARNING !!! !!! WARNING !!! !!! WARNING !!! !!! WARNING !!! Worst GTA experience i ever had IV mp was way more superior V only has autistic player database that blows you up on sight JUST LIKE MOST OF THE HACKERS IN GAME THAT MAKES YOUR GAMEPLAY/ENJOYMENT a HELL ! Rockstar does nothing about this only adds more garbage content over and over again instead of fixing the game!
0;Used to love this game when Rockstar actually gave a about improving it instead of throwing in shark cards. Rockstar nobody wants to pay ing 'insurance' in GTA. People give WoW for being a grindfest. It has nothing on this ing game. Want to drive the cool cars? You have to buy it with in game money. Oh wait you can just buy shark cards you ing This game and Rockstar can diddle my skittle
0;This is what russian call a .... 1. buy game 2. install for 4 hours. 3. start game. 4. you we got you money and we dont whanna help you.Thank you. We will make a game off you money it more and we buy server's from 1800 berfore god. Rockstar help you player's &lt 3
0;f*cking game worst company ever cant produce quality at all. They make you lose money by being shot and to get that money back in return you have to pay for shark cards. YOU HAVE TO BE BRAINDEAD TO PLAY THIS GAME OR SAY YOU ENJOY IT YOU DELUSIONAL F*CKS
0;Raising the price to CAD $90 just before the steam summer sale to avoid actually putting the game on sale. Horrible business practice that shouldn't be rewarded. A lot of people were waiting for the game to go on sale so they could buy it for a second time after a console version and this is what they thank them with.
0;If you enjoy being plagued by cheaters online then this is the game for you. Rockstar's inability to separate single player modders from cheaters using modding tools online is dumbfounding. With no loyalty to their online players they passively ban accounts after players use the in game report tool on a cheating player (which the tool can be circumvented). This game went from good to real quick. Save your money.
0;Great Series and I like it very much. (Own GTA3 Vice City San Anreas GTA 4) I bought GTA V to play with friends online. Too many hackers and griefers really spoil this for it to be decently playable. Will be better off with community owned and managed servers. DO NOT RECOMEND!
0;it was a great game rigth up to the point where you get online and get randomly banned for no reason after that rockstar support wont help because they will give you the same automated message got my second ban in 3 weeks this time for a month rockstar can just go and themself because this is t 60 bucks down the drain............
0;Graphical enhancements aside this simply wasn't as good as previous instalments. Rock$tar ran out of ideas some time ago and are now just desperately resorting to creating controversial missions in the hope of riling some angry parents into giving them some cheap publicity.And don't get me started on paying for an advantage in multiplayer Rock$tar are just showing their true greedy self serving colours.
0;Horrible Experience new players cant do anything constant camping from players that have all equipmant cant do a single mission without being killed and your mission is worthless cause they take all your money from it + hackers on every session. Dont buy it ever. Online is trash. single is mediocore. Nothing special. Shame on You rockstar for creating unplayable online game... Shame on You.
0;Modders and a$$holes literally every lobby killing you for no reasonOnly enjoyable place is singleplayer or an empty lobby 900 Hour UpdateThis game probably has the most Toxic community I've ever seenChat is literally everyone calling each other namesPeople just want to fight for the heck of itModders everywhereThe whole game is a grind boring and honestly not worth it anymoreAfter 900 Hours I'm going to make use of the Uninstall button
0;Used to be good Now it's just a money machine that has been sexually harassed by hackers that ended up ing all over it and the company that couldn't handle them.The story is meh honestly compare to the previous GTA's it was all so cheesy and expected.Sure add a few edgy characters to spice up the fandom and But the real focus of it was GTA ONLINE something Rockstar created but wasn't able to handle.As long as they got their money it was fine in their opinion.Just a disgrace.
0;This game is garbage designed for edgy ten year olds. The only thing that's SLIGHTLY good is the driving. Everything else is GARBAGE!!! I played for two hundred hours and got banned because I grinded the CEO activities. Don't buy this game. Mario kart 64 has more depth than this game.
0;This game has turned from a fun game where you could just blow crap up to a game where 2K and R* milk the game for all of the money they can get. Full of microtransactions and banning people like me who worked for their money very hard for absolutley NO reason this game is a wreck now.0/10 Would NEVER recommend.Also their support is awful i tried to contact them and they hung up on me wtf. Just dissapointing.
0;DO NOT buy this game it is a waste of time and money just got my only character to lvl 167 and just got banned for no reason. Rockstar Has thier priorities in the wrong place by banning the people why play the game by the rules and not banning the modders and hackers who plauge the game. case closed Not buying another rockstar product.
0;This game is full of cheaters and Rockstar obviously does not want to pay any more on anti cheating system since they have already got enough money when the game was bought. Instead they closed every player's account who report every cheater they meet. They think since these responsible players are much less than cheaters it is a better choice than closing every cheaters.
0;I purchased this game due to the hype of gta IV. The physics in this game are terrible. Players online as well. To get any item you would have to grind items for it. The game was meant to be fun. A virtual world where the AI can interact with you like real world scenarios. Nearly every shop is closed and i honestly found no joy in it. I'm done with this game. Good job slacking developers.
0;For 60$ this game is not worth it. From the economical issues to the over powered cops. In order to get a nice place good vehicles CEO Bunker you need well over 8 million dollars. Oh but wait! easily obtain that by simply purchasing a shark card costing you a short 100$ which alone is rediculous. The cops have lazer accuracy. In my opinion it's a let down BIG time. I don't want to be on this all the time to get big money. Bad Game better luck on Red Dead Redemption R*.
0;I've just been banned until 9/15. I'm level 123 and have LITERALLY $17M on my account TOTAL EARNED. There is no possible way that I could have cheated. Apparently Rockstar just don't care anymore and throw out bans to PEOPLE WHO DON'T CHEAT. Thanks Rockstar for destroying my faith in you. Worst $60 I've ever spent on.
0;Step 1 But GTA OnlineStep 2 While spending hours downloading look at the wonderful mods that are shown in the games NewsStep 3 Decide to try some of these wonderful looking modsStep 4 Try modsStep 5 Get bannedStep 6 Cherish the fact that your $60 was wastedProfit )
0;The move from Take Two Interactive about modding makes this game a microtransactions hell hole full of s and hackers that gets YOU banned by dropping you money. Rockstar made a great single player game Take Two Interactive maked a show called online out of it.
0;Waited TWO years to play this amazing game it is and always will be one of my favorite games but I will NOT recommend anyone buy this game due to R* being very a shady company banning people who use harmless single player mods to enhance a game that paid $60 FOR (Or in my case $70 because canada yea).
0;Singleplayer Just fantastic you can't go wrong with it. 9/10 (Collectibles and stunt jumps were HORRIBLE.)Multiplayer It's gotten to a point where I don't even open it because I risk getting a ban. Honestly I would've given a positive rating but I don't wish to support R* and it's customer service. I recommend that you please just try to avoid buying the game entirely and crack it instead.
0;Do you enjoy grinding?DO you have nothing better to do?DO YOU have infinite money and tolerance for poor PVP and awful community members?If you answered no to any of the above then this game is not for you. GTA V a game that makes you wish you had 60 dollars back because of how it gets after level 25
0;A very good game Only bad thing is the Social Club Support Example You sent a message since ur account is hacked.There answer (automated message) In order to be sure your the owner we sent a message to the new e mail adress to confirm you are the owner.11/10 Logics + I love those automated messages Every support ticket i sent has ended up with multiple automated messages.
0;Its a good gamePros Good multiplayerPlay with friends more funNice DLCSCons So many hackersBan for newbieInfo You will not be ban if u using mod example Godmode invisible superjump teleport You Will get ban if u using TimeTrial hack (DONT EVER TRY THIS)Believe me my friends using mods like godmode etc he not bannedand another my friends using timetrial hack he got ban when banwave comessoo think twice if u want instant money
0;It's a nice game and all if you want to play single player. online you just get banned for nothing.just as i did. go banned after doing a heist because the cheating system thought i was cheating. GJ Rockstar GJ. with i could downvote this game more couse now i cant even play the singleplayer because i got banned online
0;taking gliches out doesnt make the game fun glitches help you be able to find univalible thing that rockstar doesint ad into gta 5 witch makes it mery boring cause you cant explore and when people want to get a duffle bag or something they should ad is mostly a glitch and they need to listen to the community instead of deleting it maby i can change my dicition if they dont ruin it any more!
0;If you're planning to get it for multiplayer you can forget it but if you want it for singleplayer GO FOR IT!Reasons is this1. Modders that use cheats to kill you and take your weapons away and use god mode2. the multiplayer is alright without them but stupid leveling system is this you need to be a level70 for a tank but a level 100 for RPG3. some vehicles are so OP they take more hits than a tank
0;Fun in the beginning. But the game is filled with s and hackers. I got banned once when a hacker dropped me money and got permanently banned for playing with my friends and doing missions. Rockstar even refuses to unban me getting banned for not doing anything. Yeah great game with great developers
0;I don't know why Rockstar have sold out so much with this game. Giving into the worst kind of penny pinching micro transactions or why they have rolled over to 2k on all these horrible policies. Story with rockstar is always great but multiplayer is just a a mess. Now with 2k signing a cease and desist to the OPEN4 modding team I feel ablidged to leave this review.
0;waste of money. ignorant community and modders everywhere. kids dont like you they get their modder friends to crash your game. Nobody does any of the mission due to begging modders for money this game is rediculous you want this game go to ps4 or xbox one thats the only way you can enjoy this game
0;You are honestly better off torrenting/pirating this game. Not only because Rockstar will ban you for an FoV mod but because this over hyped game and developer doesn't deserve the $60 that people wasted just to get banned.2/10 Game got progressively worse over the time it was released
0;18 hours ago OpenIV was banned because Take Two wanted to take every penny that you have and put it into their overflowing wallets. Even though OpenIV was not in any way messing with online Take Two destroyed ten years of these guy's lives. F U C K YOU.
0;This is ridiculous. I was waiting for story mode DLC and you banned openIV? What the ???? I don't gave a damn about all those fancy money sucking online DLCs. I hate every single one after the Heist. I have always been a fan of this series. The company seems to be different after GTA Online. I'm really worried about the RDR2 tbh. PLEASE focus on the single player mode.
0;Never buying anything from you again. If I had to play your games vanilla all this time I'd have stopped playing them long ago.I had GTA V on XBox360 I didn't need to get it on PC but you can't mod a 360 game can you?Banning mods was a great mistake the cherry on top of the microtransaction cake.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this! .
0;Been modding GTA for over a decade its a shame yall do cease and desist to lure more microtransactions. I will be uninstalling the steam version then pirating GTAV so i can have mods installed. Oh boii I will spawn DLC cars left right and center in singleplayer. watch me TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE you will fall for this cease and desist to openiv. Just a real shame in 2017.
0;This is ing worthless. Dont ing buy it the only damn thing rockstar cares about is those ing shark cards and they shut dow openiv so theres no ing reason to play this ing cuntjuice anymore. this game. If anyone at rockstar sees this please kindly kill yourself.
0;I liked GTA V. The mods were great and honestly without the mods the single player would be incredibly boring. The multiplayer is the worst multiplayer for a GTA game ever. Thanks to Take Two for screwing over the modding scene you don't buy this game.
0;While I enjoyed the game once in recent times the addition of anti modding policies inflation of gta online asset prices the time spent earning money vs buying shark cards and the fact that a mate was banned without any consideration for appeal leads me to believe that the developers are no longer acting in the best interests for their players. They would much rather lock assets behind a paywall. Every new update includes new assets which aren't attainable from just grinding alone.
0;Since they stopped GTA modding offline i can't play anymore LSPD (Police Mod) and being a cops... Its fine that they won't have modding online but what about offline?... GTA should do somthing for people who play Police mod and stuff... cause this isn't helping..
0;They pushed a patch that made it so a large number of players cannot even launch the game. Common sense says just to go back one patch yes? They refuse stating they're trying to get rid of cheaters but by getting rid of cheaters they've also gotten rid of a ton of people that payed for a finished game and can't even LAUNCH it. Huge thumbs down.Edit They finally fixed it after 3 days.
0;"""Sending bogus cease and desist letters won't win you any support.Take Two Interactive has been blacklisted.Besides the fact that our lovely copyright overlords here have essentially killed off harmless singleplayer modding as far as I know the """"feature"""" still exists where if you actually work hard for or legitimately purchase in game currency your progress can be wiped by someone else in the server if they are cheating.It's time to stop."""
0;Over 600 hours i actually think this game is good. I regret nothing I do in it including the one ban I caused to myself and I admit that.I do admit the F2P economy of GTA 5 is cancerous and even though I don't use OpenIV I still understand what the community is suffering and support the push against it.Banning Modifications In a Nutshellhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v stNse8OjWIE
0;Wow. This game. It is so boring. There is no action. So slow. I fall asleep on the plane ride. Everything takes forever. I collect stuff and wait for someone to come get me. This is the most american game ever. Sit with your gun and wait. I'd rather play Fortnite or Lego Island.
0;I bought this game with the thought that I could mod this game for a better richer singleplayer experience. Now that's gone down the .If you've ever played Counter strike Dota Half life Team Fortress Doom etc you've played a game that started out as a mod. Modding is incredibly important for the gaming industry yet Take Two the parent company of Rockstar wants to kill it to squeeze some extra money off of microtransactions.Don't buy this game.
0;Every lobby is full of script kiddies using cheats to kill you if they dont crash your client/computer.Rockstar is most likely not going to ever fix this issue and only proceeds to ban those receiving spawned money because it competes with their in game currency sales.
0;Would be a good game if online wasn't completely ruined by modders. It isn't possible to find a session with more than maybe 10 people that doesn't have at least one modder being a Rockstar may publicly state that they are doing something about it but I haven't seen any results so there's really no reason to believe they aren't lying.
0;I really Recomended this game it so beautifful almost in every aspect. But Unless you prepare to get banned for unknown reason and when you ask their support section for the reason. they will give you a link yeah JUST A LINK. with almost no chance to get unbanned.I suspected they dont really know the way this Automatic system work. the one who really know is their technician who made this system.
0;DO NOT BUY this game if you have an invidia graphics card it will not work it will just crash and pretty much none of the solutions from the forums work you will be unable to contact rockstar support because you will be unable to attach the required files that will not exist and steam support being what it is you can just forget about playing this game a complete waste of money
0;Taking away OpenIV is like taking away Modding in the elderscrols games. Unlike Bethesda whom embrace the community of hard working modders who improve upon their games on a daily basis taketwo have decided that this isn't what they want for their game and would rather have us all boycot it instead.3 years ago this would have been an instant recomend and a 10/10 it's now an instant do not buy and a 0/10. YOU Taketwo you royal s.
0;WAS a great game. Loved it. Played it a ton put a ton of time and effort into it. Logged in today to play and all that effort and time was completely gone wiped out. All my cars gone form my garage in multiplayer never to be seen again. Will never play again. Such BS.
0;Due to the recent issue with Take Two and OpenIV I'm going to have to give this game a negative review. Modding is a HUGE part of GTA and keeps the game refreshing and not stale while being non damaging to the online players.OpenIV doesn't affect multiplayer whatsoever and solely focuses on interesting additions to single player. Fix your Take Two.
0;Soooo This game used to be fun I've bought it 3 times. But what Take Two are doing is wrong their plan to increase micro payments and remove modding for single player is wrong to say that they don't get enough money when GTA is the 4th most sold game is ridiculous. I hope something gets done. Remember that this is not R*. It is Take Two
0;Single player 9/10Multiplayer 1/10 (the time what it takes to do all the heists) too boring too grindyIf you care about PC gaming and awesome modding community around it don't buy GTA V there are a plenty of smaller developers that made awesome games and are fully supporting mods support them instead.
0;This is not a barrage against R* unless they support Take Two's decision. Take Two needs to get their sorted out if they want new players and old players to play this game or for that matter any of their games. Banning Openiv was one of the stupidist moves I have ever seen and if you want me back as a player. BRING OPENIV BACK AND DON'T BAN ANY MORE MODS.
0;take two actively fights modding and strips players of millions even if they only recieve a few thousand UNINTENIONALLY from cheaters. blast t2 blast the direction they're taking this game. DO NOT BUY.EDIT OPENIV back online apparently due in part to rockstar. still wouldn't touch t2's other ip without reading reviews of their game.
0;Take Two has gone too far. They make nearly a billion in revenue for one game and they can't let their loyal customers be free?? I will never support ANY game in affiliation with TakeTwo and i strongly urge any and all to follow. Modding is a right for all of us as gamers. Using it improperly should result in a ban however many are mature enough to use it as it was intended. And that is for it to bring back the excitement that these games used to produce. DON'T LET THEM TAKE OUR FREEDOM!
0;Unfortunately without mods I cannot reccommend this game. I bought it on PC primarily to be able mod it (which by the way is fantastic fun people have created so many amazing additions for singleplayer) and with the C&amp D sent to OpenIV it seems that singleplayer modding of this game may cease to exist.
0;After the last update Rockstar and Take2 have killed all single player mods started banning players for no reason all to push everyone to buy more massively overpriced Shark Cards. GTA was fun while it lasted. Don't support Rockstar anymore avoid like the plague.

RIP OpenIV
0;Online is filled with hackers which will get you a lifetime ban regardless of if you intentionally interacted with them and also regardless of how many hours you have sunk into the game.Take Two is trying to say that modding is illegal and stopping the majority of singleplayer mods.Do not buy and do not support this.
0;What started has a great game with a nice online features became one of the worst experience for a game in my life. I was permanently banned for using the discord overlay approved by rockstar themselves. Rockstar doesn't care about it's fans they only see the numbers pilling in. I bought most of the rockstar game but no more
0;GTA V is one of the best games I've played. But Take2 is a bunch of money s. Everyday people who are fun to play with get banned because they like to Mod. It's complete T! How can we buy a simple car that we like unless we spend 100 hours playing the game or $100 buying shark cards.
0;I used to love GTA. I even bought this on ps3 and PC. But their recent actions against the modding community is showing just how crap their business model is. This game is 4 years old almost let us have our mods. Let us have our private servers. Let the community have the game they want. Your online servers are terrible the hacking is rampant (WITHOUT MODS) and you're only showing us that you care simply for shark card sales. Thumbs down. Shame on you.
0;"""lost all of my money that i had earned in the game because I """"might have"""" been given illegitimate money. 5 million dollars i grinded out by playing races and running cars not to mention all the """"free money"""" theyve given me just for playing the game. Just because you have it out for people distrupting your B.S. shark card sales.get bent Rockstar ill never buy one of your games ever again."""
0;Rockstar's policy when dealing with online modders is to carpet ban people. Plus Take Two decides it's a good idea to just C&amp D the biggest source of new content via OpenIV. So these people and this game. Yeah they got my money. They ain't getting anything more now.
0;Take 2 is actively trying to kill the SINGLE PLAYER modding of this game. Single player doesn't affect them other players etc. It literally means they're trying to stop people from using the game that they purchased with their own money the way they want.Garbage.Do not give a garbage company that chooses to punish gamers for playing their own games the way they want more money. Do not buy this game or buy microtransactions.
0;The lovely devs probly have so much money they can get there genitals replaced with solid gold versions. Screw you c***star for the ban i didnt diserve now go over more people like you always do. To bad the $200+ i spent on the base game alone over the consoles didnt save me. ALSO WHY DO YOU HAVE A REPEAL BAN WHEN YOUR BOTS JUST SEND OUT THE YOU CANT REPEAL BANS MSG?
0;I really like the game but I hate Rockstar and Take Two's anti consumer and anti PC policies. Not only did they make the PC community wait and entire year to play the game now they have banned modding the single player experience on top of that. The publisher should offer a full refund and apology to anyone who bought this game on PC.
0;"""Take Two just killed off single player modding (Not the multiplayer modding thats been plaguing the game since launch)""""But why would they do that?"""" Because you can't buy shark cards for single player. They are making another money grab at one of the best selling games of all time and sending a message to the community that """"Hey We don't care"""" I would not support this game under current leadership."""

0;Take Two recently decided to try and kill all mods for the game and are threatening modders with cease and desist orders (all of which comes after they physically sent representatives to the home of a modder for the purpose of intimidation).This applies to singleplayer mods that disable online access when used.The game is fantastic but Take Two is actively alienating a large part of the community by threatening legal action.
0;This game is very fun to play has excellent graphics and a interesting story.I think it's a small step back in the physics department car handling rag doll and hand to hand combat compared to GTA IV.Still can't recommend it because of Take2 actions against OpenIV.
0;On behalf of the OpenIV team you.Seriously didn't care about cheating at all just selling their stupid shark cards for online content which is way overpriced just like the shark cards. 'em. Now they are trying to ban some cheater and their software to maybe make up for their stupid decision? You already ed up. No way people are going to forget. you Take Two you.
0;I have had GTA 5 for about 6 months and rockstar has just killed off the modding community by not making open IV work on it. Rockstar has to change this because they've killed of most of the pc fanbase by baiscly banning mods which is a very big selling point for GTA 5. Sorry for only having the 4th best selling game in the world and wanting to make more money by forcing players to go online and force them to by virtual money.
0;Previously being one of the most fun games I have ever played. Now with several extremely boring and money wasting DLCs this game has turned into one of the most time consuming anti relaxing games in my Steam library. (Gunrunning DLC has totally ruined the free roam and that is the reason I quit GTA Online.) Lastly the main focus of this game should not be deliberately adding obstacles in order to sell Shark Cash Cards.
0;Rockstar constanty makes the game less fun for everyone and ruin modding. They destroy any potential for the online mode to turn into anything worth while. Rockstar is slowly becoming the new Ubisoft and EA with this new update.Edit Despite the t efforts to take away modding I have run into a hacker that took away all my ammo and guns. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT CURRENT STATE
0;I stand with the modders stop making us have to use shark cards to even come close to enjoying the content you give us this wouldnt be a problem if things werent so overcharged and BEFORE anyone says it's not a grind... look at my damn hours.Get your sh*t together rockstar
0;"""Most hours that I played this games were in singleplayer MODDED SINGLEPLAYER I used OPENIV for most of these mods I am glad it returned. WHY DID YOU HAVE TO F""""CK THIS UP!!! I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS T YOU F""""CKED UP ONLINE AND THEN EVEN SINGLEPLAYER!"""
0;Gta has a legacy of mods. Its whats keeping the game and the community alive long after the hype dies down. And on top of that gta is famous for its modded content. However this time the devs have decided to kill of the core of whats keeping it alive. Its mods. Take two I hope you see this. I hope you change your mind. Don't kill off GTA 5. If you plan to buy this game I advice you don't.
0;Take Two and Rockstar have gone too far.I turned my eye at no online modding I turned my eye at no online third party servers but I cannot turn my eye on modding itself.Definitely not buying any more Take Two or Rockstar products until this is resolved.
0;Characters are unlikable gunplay is a slap in the face to R* games like Max Payne and Red Dead Online is full of no fun bullhonkey the story/side missions/etc felt like they were written by a parody of a satirist who wasn't funny to begin with. Also obligatory attitude towards mods.The driving was ok. GTA IV was better.R* already made me and everybody else's money don't throw yours onto the fire.
0;I bought this game twice for different platforms and after some 140hs on Steam alone Take Two/Rockstar has decided to ruin the game for single player users with the excuse that they are fighting online cheaters.Meanwhile online mode is still plagued with cheaters.DO NOT BUY THIS
0;I rarely review games but I feel like it needs to be said. OpenIV was a huge part of why PC version of GTA V was so popular. Prohibiting modding the very thing which brought me to this series is wrong. These aggressive methods of forcing players to play Online and purchase Shark Cards are sad to see. I obviously am a drop in the bucket but I don't think I'll buy any of their games in the future and I hope there will be enough players who will do the same.
0;They dont add DLC to singleplayer. So mods are the way to go... oh wait no you cant do that anymore. OK so go online that's were the DLC is so its ok. Oh everything costs ALOT of money. I guess i'll do hiests with randoms cuz i have no friends to play this with. They keep dying or leaving.... ok so just normal missions i guess.WOW i got $4 000 in the 20 minutes that took.I guess they only way to play is to buy shark cards.
0;"""Removing mod support and sent cease and desist to modders!Still taking full price for the game but still want even more money from micro trancations.As some CEO or some from Take two interactive said """"The users arent paying us enough to play our games so we need to charge them more""""Never buying another rockstar game again if they don't go back on this."""
0;Don't indulge in this game. It's just a time and money sink that gets you nowhere with the added bonus of not being able to mod anything at all anymore. Good thing that I paid like half price for this game one time and not a dollar more. Enjoy it if you want because I assure you there are still people but don't pay for it.
0;As I found Grand Theft Auto V and GTA O to be grindy and not much fun I mostly played it with friends. However the C&amp D order almost certainly issued out of greed by the developers was the nail in the coffin for me. I don't want to play a game whose developers hold such contempt for their modding community. I'm adding Rockstar and to my list of game developers never to buy from in the future and I implore you to do the same.
0;Not only GTA Online is filled with hackers and pieces of Take Two decided it would officially tell the community to themselves. Don't think Rockstar isn't ok with this though because they've been banning single player modders and people who HAD to mod the game in order to run it on their PC's since launch the OpenIV cease and desist was probably welcomed in the R* offices.Don't support this t don't buy this game.
0;Money grabbing They make it so hard to make money that you pretty much have to buy money. So every deal they make gives them another opportunity to get more money off you as you want the more overpowered cars. If you wanted to earn the money you would have to no life the out of it. If You want to buy a range rover you should just save for one irl takes the same amount of time.
0;Besides the recent modding situation actually buying something in GTA O takes many many hours. If you do not have the time you are forced to buy shark cards which are a total rip offBuying most of the content added in just the latest dlc could easily cost 240GBP
0;If you came from consoles due to all those amazing mods you saw on youtube of being the flash and living in a post apocalyptic world then please do yourself a favor....Go buy Dead Rising or Injustice Because Take Two and Rockstar has made it Illegal to mod any aspects of the GTA games.
0;Hackers everywhere on GTA Online they force you to dance in place for minutes on end. They removed single player mods that keep their game alive Made the price of the game 80$ before the steam sale so they can sell it with a discount and still make more money.Take 2 and Rockstar are disappointing.
0;"""Go yourself Take Two And C***star """"Oh but OpenIV ruins GTA Online for everybody!"""" Get ing bent. OpenIV was singleplayer exclussive and their online component is and always has been ing NOTORIOUS for modders and NONE of them used ing OpenIV. The only way I'm ever going to launch this game again will be to mod the out of online and cost Take It In The and C***Star as much money as possible. You TT you C*."""
0;i had fun with this game for a long time but after hearing that take two interactive is trying to stop the single player modding scene i cant support it i will still play online but i cant say you should buy a game from a company that is trying to end its modding scene.
0;This game was great when modding was allowed until Take Two decided that earning money from online microtransactions was more important and decided to make modding ILLEGAL.Do NOT buy this game and boycott Take Two.Please sign this petition as well https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;The best part of this game is the open mod support allowing almost endless freedom in the single player.HOWEVERThe multiplayer cash cow that it is is no longer making enough money for the developers of this game so therefore they have taken out the majority of mods in an attempt to shift more people into the multplayer mode which is to be frank A Microtransaction riddled grind fest with less freedom than the real world.So in summary If you wanted to have fun on this game it's too late.
0;Its a game thats objectively okay but went to because of taketwo's handling of it. no player freedom no ability to mod and its ruining a game which is essentially a blank slate for doing what ever you want.Also on behalf of OpenIV's team suck my nuts.
0;I bought this game for the soul purpose of modding and playing LSPDFR as it was one of my favorite things in GTA IV. To hear that take two sent a cease and desist to the open IV team (a team supporting ONLY single player mods). This makes me absolutely disgusted. If I could return this game at this point just to take my $60 back from take two I would. Screw you anti consumer bastards. I hope you all get fired for this
0;I know what I'd do if I make a really successful game that has an awesome machinima community with great single player mods that allows people to keep playing it 2 years after release...I'll bend over all those loyal players and give them the rough end of the pineapple that'll make me more money!
0;Perhaps the finest most refined and most repulsive example of a company so desperately intoxicated by the wallets of a fanbase so abused that it brings any merit such a game may have once possessed into total irrelevance.To have the audacity to kill the modding community the only force that gives this game any semblance of life is beyond disgusting and cannot and will not stand.
0;If I at least could have launched the game and played it without crashing for a million of different reasons I'd be happy but without any solution from rockstar about those erros when all they have to do is to delete their launcher and forget about it for ever Im asking myself why i planned to buy the game
0;As long as Rockstar takes a negative stance on SIngle player mods and bans people this down vote will remain. Welcome to PC gaming WAKE UP Rockstar.WHY IS INTERNET REQUIRED TO PLAY SINGLE PLAYER??? FU!!!!!!CANCERCOUS PAY TO WIN STRUCTURE that keeps me from playing onlineShark Cards are a scamAlso FU for threatening to sue OPENIV and forcing them to stop single player mods you guys suck as bad as EA and Ubisoft now gg
0;This game is so terrible. I got suspended for 30 days and I came back. ONE DAY after reinstalling reformatting my hardive to make sure no files that were unknown. ONE DAY after they permantly ban me. I didn't even get to go online for more than 1 hour before they did this. I have no idea why and Rockstar says you can't appeal bans even though I haven't done anything wrong. If you're thinking about buying this game do yourself a favor and don't. Just Don't
0;ING GETTING RID OF THE MODDING SYSTEM FOR ONYL SINGLE PALYER SO THEY CAN GET MORE PEOPLE ONTO MULTIPLAYER SO THEY CAN GET MORE ING MONEY FROM MICROTRANSACTIONS. WTF REALLY! AFTER 10 YEARS AND ONE OF THE BEST SELLING GAMES OF ALL TIME AND YOU SAY IT ROCKSTAR? REALLY SAKE
0;I've never reviewed a game on steam before but Take 2's blatant disregard for their consmuers is just shameful. I myself had just started getting into GTA mods and now they are trying to stop me from doing somthing that doesnt even harm anyone elses experience. you Take 2
0;Thanks to Take Two for ruining the fun in this game and shutting down OpenIV. Will never buy another Take Two game ever again.Edit Take Two and Rockstar came out and said that they were doing this because it affected their players... pfff. Rockstar and Take Two dont care about their players just the money they bring to the table.
0;nice story mode for singleplayer and good game to play if you have a lots of friends willing to play together but cheaters/noobs/modders completely ruin at gta online.. outta the hours i play (mostly heist cuz i dont wanna spend real money to get cash in game so i basically grind heist for big money ) with random player at heist alwasy leave mid game rage quit or completey suck so dont buy this game if u like to play alone...
0;Tried playing Online crashed the first 3 times got to loading screen then crash got to character creation and crashed both times I got that far. Apperently the only way to fix this glitch is to redownload the whole ing game. At 62.3 GB and 4 days of downloading I'd rathar kill myself.0/10
0;gta v is my first legal purchase and my first step from leaving piracy and supporting the dev but....i guess i wont play gta v again until openIV case cleared. thanks to the salty Take Two legal team. what a blunder to destroy the game replayability for almost 5 years
0;Your actions regarding OpenIV are entirely undefendable yes hacking in online is a problem (especially when they're being but a cease and desist is not a valid response try again.Welcome to the free market.If you fix this I will come back and alter my review.
0;I am tired of all the hackers in the game just crashing servers now. Its not a bombard to kill everyone thing anymore now its a crash the fkin server by spawning in HUGE quantities. Until patched or more security is taken into consideration fk this thumbs down.
0;Won't be buying any more Rockstar games if their brain dead out of touch publisher is going to take a hard stance against modding in an effort to line their pockets.GTAV isn't a fraction of the game it was now that the modding tools that we use are being targeted and taken down.Shame on you Rockstar and Take Two. You guys are filthy.Avoid these companies like a plague.
0;Problems constantly ignored by support constant issues that are not ever dealt with gunrunning is a horrible update and it feels like rockstar is purposely trying to make the game as unenjoyable for it's players as possible. Also the end of OpenIV is basically going to drive away half of the games playerbase.
0;Micro transaction this micro transaction that screw over single player modding this can only be used online online online online. All the developers of this game care about is taking money from your pockets and putting it in theirs oh that and online the playform in which they take your money for top quality bants.
0;Take Two Interactive who own R* ordered modders to stop modding this game. Given that lots of people enjoy mods and I'd wanted to too this is a move. This game is fun if it wasn't I'd not have so many hours in it. But abuses of your playerbase for profit aren't acceptable.
0;Ban modding and community innovation and you will no longer have a community to support you or buy your games.Developer is a selfish company that couldn't give two about it's players and would rather see $$$ flowing in over a smile on a gamer's face. This type of isn't welcome or acceptable in a modern marketplace especially in the gaming genre.
0;Horrible loading time specifically true in multiplayer. Game has the amaizing habit of dropping your connection right when you start having fun. In its current state its a shameless cash cow and an empty shell of something great.All that being said this game is actualy pritty entertaining for a loading screen simulator.
0;The singleplayer is fun and the multiplayer was fun to play with friends initially but it has turned into a cluster of microtransactions added vehicles and guns. If you don t buy the microtransactions then you are pretty much out of luck and then you ll have a harder time obtaining some of the fun new content. We must abide by their rules if we don t then they will start attacking the community. RIP OpenIV
0;I played this game for a long time.... years.... I bought it at least three times. Xbox 360. pc. and pc for my wife... We played all the time together Throught my own fault got banned from online modding the game. But for this reason I got into PC GAMING. I love the openess of the pc world.. BUT take 2 games forcing OpenIV to stop making a free modding tool. Shity and petty. dont waste you time
0;GTA V is a money whoring fest of hackers squeakers and downright bags. Modding was my way of getting from multiplayer into singleplayer without having to go into the cancer. Take 2 being Take 2 wants more money out of the second best selling game of all time them they've made almost 1.5 billion off of this game and I'm not giving them another ing penny.
0;(gta online) they need to make heists give more money and make more heists than making more cars for 20 millon the only time stuff was affordable was before the gun running update so the last good one was the biker as the gang place costs only 300 000 and people could get that money from heists but now with all of this cool stuff being expensive people hack the game i would not mind the price of vehicles i we got more money for what we do
0;"""The updates only happen for the online mode. The online mode has way too much focus on """"micro"""" transactions. The load times for online mode are still (Since launch) very long. Instead of giving some updates and give a little more content to the singleplayer mode they just pump out more content for the online mode which you have to either grind a long time for or buy with real money."""
0;I was affected from cheater by use program to add money to my character and I move to another session immediately after that I reported to rockstar support now several days later that money is still not remove when I look at status of my case I found that status is closed.every of my evidence that I Attach will show you that im not guilty im not using any cheat or obstruct to another players I can guarantee I play under your rule. RockStar you very bad. I will not support Rockstar games.
0;This is a pretty good game until out of the blue I got banned and lost all of my stuff. Now I haven't done anything remotely wrong in this game. A hacker gave me money but I didn't ask for it and I'm not the person that likes to hack thing because then the game is not as fun but RockStar this is Bullcrap!
0;whenever i want to play gta i cant. i dont know if there is something wronge withy my game or gta in general but...... when ever the game loads (that takes FOREVER) it will not work fine. it will be fine for like half a second then it laggs forever. i know for sure it is not my pc that has the lag problen trust me my pc is very good. this is the only game that is doing it. i have also had other problems with other rockstar games but not this one until now. please someone help me!
0;I honestly loved this game i couldnt get enough of it even the endless grinding for money was fun and an experience on its own... But i feel that the game is broken due the last update. Everything shoots missles now so prepare to play your game is passive mode or on a solo session to avoid getting blown up by flying bikes and planes and cars and tanks and a whole lot of other that shoots explosive ammo.
0;Rockstar and Take Two!Without modding GTA will be another game and since they are removing mods.. i dont recommend buying it..They ruined their own game and i wont be surprised if their sales will go down big time! Rockstar again And TAKE TWOLuv you OpenIV!Stay Strong D
0;Okay time to change this up. TakeTwo... why? do you have any idea what you are doing?congratulations by the way it takes real skill to have your name smashed in 24 hours. I nominate TakeTwo for the stab their player base in the back and get totally ****ed by them Award Bring back Open IV and work with them not against them you idiots Sign this if you agree https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv?source_location petition_nav
0;Take Two have destroyed the player base in lust for more and more money. So many players brought the game 2 or 3 times and the high majority bought it on PC just so they could mod the singleplayer and have fun. GTA O is a profit first scheme that is non accessible to the average player who don't want to spend cash on in game money. It's a shame to see one of the most loved and almost best selling game of all time get driven into the ground in the journey to getting richer.
0;The game was kinda meh then the mods started rolling out and made it amazing. Then Take2 sent a Cease and Desist letter to the team behind OpenIV (a framework which about half of the damned mods published are using) and ruined it again.Don't give these moneyhungry SOBs any of your f*cking money don't allow them to get away with this!
0;this game trys to get me to the mulitiplayer so they can charge me for money and you will see that if you play this game on singleplayer and multiplayer and they are also getting rid of all the mods in singleplayer so that would push more people to the multiplayer and in the multiplayer they wont stop hackers even though they will ruin your whole exspeirenceand they will get the hackers that hack in moneys because when they have a lot of money from hacking they carnt charge them for it
0;"""Product received for free. """"SUDDENLY MODS ARE ILLEGAL! NO FUN ALLOWED!"""" Scream the corporate heads who had nothing to do with putting this game together.And holy how did this jump back up to full AAA price like years after release? these guys frankly. Don't give them a goddamn penny of your money."""
0;"""Nicely done RockStar!!!If you report cheaters thenEA Although we have enabled """"EFFICIENT"""" Fairfight we will send a battlepack to you.R* Worry about hacker? LUL its esay just send a ban to someone innocent who played with or tipped off cheaters.Poor PC gamersRIP OpenIV and Press F to pay respects for R*"""
0;The online part is riddled with hackers. Many reports of players getting banned from others hacking in the same session. Multiplayer seems extremely unbalanced when it comes to missions involving other players. Not a fun experience.Every other aspect is extremely fun and enjoyable. I wish the issues described weren't so severe as to limit the rest of the game.
0;Bad move on TakeTwo removing Open IV.The modding online that affects players is rampant as ever. Removing the creative side of Open IV removes the whole point i spent 1500+ hours on this game... this game is KNOWN FOR SP MODSDont take it away from all the hard work people put in for single player modsAbsolutely disappointing
0;After playing this on and off for a long period of time it is an enjoyable time waster particularly the online portion.However I can't in good conscience reccomend a game where its publisher bullies a dedicated group of fans who created the tools to add entertaining mods that further increases my enjoyment of the game. Particularly when the claims in their Cease and Desist have little to no merrit when modding is considered fair use.Don't support this publisher!0/5 do not reccomend.
0;Don't blame your toxic online community on mods. This game (basically a crime simulator) is what attracts those kinds of gamers NOT the mods. Not to mention your pay to win model giving massive vehicle and firepower advantages to those willing to pay for them with real world currency.
0;Take two Rockstar's parent company has decided that modding is illegal and has issued a cease and desist to the maker of OpenIV. When they stop this distructive action against the GTAV modding scene I will make this review positive.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOWTAKE TWO IS VERY ANTI CONSUMER
0;i love this game on xbox 360 but on pc right now i have a $2 000 pc overclocked and has a amd turbo card amd 8 gb of ram and a intel(R) Core(TM) i7 4770k CUP and i cant go any where near the city so i hope gta v reads this because you need to fix performance (yes i know there going to be problems because it just came out) but at the end it fun to play
0;I don't normally write a review for games but I am making an exception because of the poor decision by the makers of this game. I only really purchased this game because I enjoyed playing with the LSPDFR mod on single player. Now that the company is attacking a large portion of users who play with mods and working to restrict the use of mods it seems pointless to have the game. I guess it'll sit in my game library and collect proverbial dust. Oh well.
0;"""A decent game made by a decent developer ruined by a money hungry publisher forcing them to only make dlc for the online mode (where the only way you can get anything is to grind for days or spend 20 on """"mirco""""transactions) and which bans single player mods to force people into the online mode."""
0;Ok after a couple years i have to say don't buy this A fly bike seriously? you rockstar you!! WTF this is a GTA not a SAINTROW t so u put a fly bike like a ET to this Multiplayer comeon and the update focus only your income same buy thing and thing oh i'm going to crazy with this multiplayer DO NOT BUY THIS !!! for Multiplayer
0;got banned for nothing a cheater spawned many players beside him and killed us all with blowing cars (he didn't throw money on us) got banned for 30days even i was a victim...tired to explain to rockstar and they just sent me auto messages....the singleplayer is awesome as every previous game but online mode is awful with those cheaters and modder s and ban policy...if you plan to buy this game be prepared to get banned for nothing
0;After several amazing years of modding it is cruel and entirely unecesary to take it all away like this. There was little to no research done on Take 2's end when they sent the cease and decist letter. I hope Take2 learn from this monumental mistake and backpedal moving on as a smart company.
0;Just save yourself some disapointment and dont buy this when it was released it actually was a better game there were less buggy missions + heists mostly worked but now youve got a hacker per lobby and everyone owns it without having a good pc so you cant ing finish a heist without someone leaving midway.
0;The Multiplayer is micro transactioned to hell. so unless you like cash out of your wallet it's not fun. The single player is lacking a lot of content that is in the game specifically to force people into the miultiplayer. And they're killing the modding community to prevent people from resisting this.They then proceded to lie to the community claiming the single player mods were affecting the online side.
0;Rockstar must love ing things up by allowing modder to mod. But they are ing things up even more by banning mods instead of banning the modders online. Don't buy this game in its current state. Random innocent individuals are getting banned for no valid reason and fckstar takes GTA Online money away from innocent people like me and you too. Today I lost 1 300 000$ online because of this ttery. Go yourself rockstar or star
0;No. Just no.All modders are treated like criminals. Instead of targeting people who exploit their own lack of security Take Two have decided to destroy the single player modding community and banning innocent bystanders who are victim to drive by hackers in Online.
0;I am happy to say...this is the last game I will by buying from Rockstar and Take Two. An absolutely lame effort to make even more money when they are clearly rolling in the success of the Franchise. It never ends for the Financiers grab the cash and run. To all those who are at the top of the pyramid you can all just walk off the cliff's edge. Bye bye!!! You suck. Game over.
0;"""Had a lot of fun in this game but whenever there are new stuff added in game there are also a lot of bugs joining the new stuff! The Online part is almost always broken! And now Take Two is banning mods from single player game?!! What happened to """"we support mods"""" ? ing cynical company!I'm tired of seeing the consumers getting screwed over and over again by companies like Take Two who says something one day and does the opposite the next day!"""
0;This game used to have a singleplayer campaign with great replayability. Used to.But then Take Two Interactive decided to legally threaten the developers of a popular free mod under false pretenses. A mod which had been out for almost a decade.I can not in good conscience recommend anyone to buy this game now. If it is on sale for 10 bucks sure. Otherwise STAY AWAY! (Oh and Online is infested with hackers so it is not worth it.)
0;After seeing my friends and I who have never modded being banned for no reason. I rate this game to be one of the most cancerous groups i have been a part of. Spending over 1 000 hours of nonstop play just to get permanantly banned with no explanation
0;Great Job Rockstar you actually managed to F*ck us once again with your Take Two Garbage. This game was always a joke and will continue to be. Every single update they force you to buy their overpriced shark cards that get you absolutely nowhere in the game. Out of any of the games out on steam this game by far needs modders because rockstar just keeps f*ck ng everyone every update.
0;Single player game best on PC by a country mile. Multiplayer is full of kids hacking and ruining the game. With Rockstar making no effort to remove the kids I can't reccommend this game. I will score this game for both online and offline because disregarding the fantastic single player experience all because of the poor online experience would be wrong.My Score Single Player 10/10My Score Multi Player 0/10 Awful Rockstar are lazy as fuc.k. Deal with the hackers you stupid fuc'ks.
0;The modding community and OpenIV have had a huge impact on PC gaming as a whole. Take Two has destroyed years of hard work on the behalf of hundred of thousands of modders who do not earn any kind of revenue from their work but only seek to improve a beloved game. I'm not mad just disappointed. No wait I'm also furious.
0;The only reason I bought this game on PC was so I could mod it. After paying $60 multiple times so I could mod my single player game. They decided we aren't making enough money off you in micro transactions ok lets just make mods illiegal so the only way people can play the content after paying full price for the game is grinding for hours on cancars online servers or paying for microtransactions.
0;I bought this game for PS3 PS4 and had a blast. The it was announced on PC and the ONLY reason I bought for the THIRD TIME was to play this game with mods. Been able to play as The Flash driving a ferrari shooting whales at people with a minigun was super fun... But you had to mess it up by taking down OpenIV.Not cool Take Two.
0;You guys provide a brilliant foundation for modders to use as a platform to learn and create really wonderful things. And now you're stopping them from being creative and learning from thair creative projects just so you can squeeze a few more billion from your GTA online users. Sad.
0;An unacceptable example of corporate greed. Give us our mods back. We will not be forced into micro transactions in gta online. You know for a fact that open IV only works with single player and is not responsible for the hackers in gta online. Maybe if you put some money into actually developing anti hacking software you could stop them.
0;Take Two and their t now means modding a huge part of this game for many people is now permanently gone. Not only does this screw over the players but also the modders who worked tirelessly to make quality content for free. Oh and the multiplayer is a toal grind fest with the only way to make money efficiently is selling your kidney to buy 'shark cards' a paywall that should not even be there in a 50 game!
0;Never buying a Take 2 or Rockstar game again. Been playing GTA V since it released on 360 and eageraly waited for it to launch and guess maybe they're trying to make their games console only cause almost every modding site for GTA V is getting C&amp D's so just you Take 2. The day you witch hunt like this you alienate your pc playerbase.
0;I was a fan of this game but as soon as they started to remove modding from this game it turned awful. It seems like all Take 2 wants is more money. So instead of being nice and making customers happy they screw them over and make them pay extra or grind for hours on end. Not to mention there have been no updates to singleplayer even for items put into multiplayer. They really could care less about the people that play their games as long as money is flowing in.
0;Take Two. How about instead of shutting down one of the worlds largest mod communities you take your hands out of your assess and start to target the hackers themselves. They are the problem here. You morons have no idea what you've just done to yourselves by doing this. You F**CKED up so badly. And this will go down in gaming history as one of the most ridiculously inpractical and stupid moves a gaming company has ever made.Get wise you tools and target the right people.
0;This is what micro transactions do to a stellar game and a Developer who everyone thought could do no wrong.Singleplayer is A+ but GTA Online is nothing but a F2P grind fest that has AAA pricetag on it.Rockstar you really ed up and are only digging yourselves deeper.
0;Was and still is an incredible game but when you ban something that has made this game thrive for years knowing that it will cause chaos. Well that's just a low blow Take2 one of the worst possible things you could have done to your games. Knowing that there are people who only play this game for the mods because not everyone has that speedy connection for online it's just a dog act.#RIPOPENIV
0;They must have given the PC community the finger at least a half dozen times by now. They don't care about us or modding but when the modders give out money suddenly they care. How about you try caring when I'm getting teleported around and blown up too? Will not buy another rockstar game.
0;Horrible and unethical publisher/developer. They are currently trying to shut down modding to the single player game and prevented multiplayer modes separate to their built in online. Oh and the problem in online with cheaters mostly comes from the fact that they don't have a place for those kinds of players (meaning private servers without character progression so they can have fun with their friends or other players that like to mess around).
0;This game is good and but only if you play it offline. Don't go online or you'll get mad. From 8 hours of playing 6 of those were on loading screens entering job lobbies people quit return to free roam get another job take forever to enter the lobby try to do the job people die go back to free roam...rinse and repeat. It will just give you frustration and anxiety. Go play something that don't take 5 minutes to load your online game and end up saying that you timed out return later...
0;Take Two doesn't care about their players. They only seem to care about money.All that is important to them is selling shark cards. Now they are taking away single player mods by stopping OpenIV.The reason for me to buy the pc version is so I can mod. Without mods I do not want to play GTAV.First Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick thinks of its players only as cash cows and now this....I'm done with them. Do Not Buy This Game And NEVER EVER Buy a Shark Card.
0;i love this game before take 2 ban open iv mod it make storymode so boring because after we end the story there is nothing for me to do so I go to play online mode it is good but i don't like 1 thing in onlinemode it is price of everything in online mode is expensive example bunker near the beach is 1 650 00 I don't sure about the price but it is 1.4Million+ but we earn money only 25 000 per heist setup but each day in game we have to pay for utilities

No.Henry the mild mannered janitor?Could Be!Hong Kong Phooey number one super guy.Hong Kong Phooey quicker than the human eye.He's got style a groovy style and a car that just won't stop.When the going gets rough he's super tough with a Hong Kong Phooey chop.Hong Kong Phooey number one super guy.Hong Kong Phooey quicker than the human eye.Hong Kong Phooey fannn riffic!
0;Take Two should be ashamed of themselves. Modding has been a key part of GTA on PC for decades and now they decide to pull this crap!I can't recommend this game anymore perched behind a publisher who doesn't care for their players or customers.Also Gunrunning sucks a massive money sink with little in return.
0;The Game has a great Strory insane Graphics and really good controls.But the Online Mode keeps getting badder since everything good is really expensivepeople began to mod the game and give money for free.Since the last update tho rockstar banned those modders and now the Online Mode is an endless Grind.Just because Rockstar wants to sell in game currency.To Rockstar Sell games not currency Thank you
0;"""80 for 8M in game that is not even enough for a stupid boat that doesn't sail. take two is pushing gta to p2w with their """"micro"""" transactions. money is hard to get and very easy to spend even by mistake. heist are the greatest thing but they just keep creating other stuff. singleplayer dlc is just a dream. now they block mods the best addition to any gta title ever. i spent countless hours playing samp. wake up take two."""
0;Do not buy this game for GTA Online PLEASE! Way too many modders online just doing whatever the hell they want and Devs don't seem to care. If you buy GTA V for RP or Singleplayer you will be fine and probably happy. Also there is no filter for servers like a langauge filter... so most likely you will be in a lobby filled with people who don't even speak your language. /
0;Could be so good could be an amazing Snatch Oceans 11 Heat style heist game but is really just a huge time sink to try and get you to buy cash cards from Rockstar. Incredibly rife with hacking and cheating so playing open world is just stressful playing with friends is good but again unless you want to spend hours doing the same thing over and over to get a car then a few more to upgrade it and style it it's not worth your time.
0;The graphics on computer are so much better. I have played since 2013 on Xbox 360 but the game seems to get worse as every update is released. Online full of hackers and it takes ages to load. I haven't played in months and I am very dissapointed to see my mods don't work since rockstar has banned them all.
0;Take 2 sent a C&amp D to OpenIV. A program to specifically allow SINGLE PLAYER modding. This comes after they did the same to FiveM. A mod that added multiplayer with dedicated servers to the singleplayer part of GTA V (didn't touch GTA O)This is not okay!
0;The Online gameplay is decent but much of the content is too expensive to purchase without sharkcards or hackers and they have only increased prices recently.They have now also told the Singleplayer modding community to go their hat with the cease and desist sent to OpenIV an incredibly popular single player mod that did absolutely no harm to anyone. GG Take Two Sodomize yourself with a retractable baton.
0;If you want to buy this game because of the ability to mod it DON'T.Take Two Interactive the company that owns Rockstar has killed off modding due to a cease and desist sent to the creators of OpenIV by Take Two Interactive. OpenIV to put it simply is the main tool used to download mods for GTA V. This means that it is now for the most part not possible to mod GTA V anymore IN SINGLEPLAYER. This is completely ridiculous and has ruined the game for many many people.
0;This used to be one of the best games in existence since the dlc has been overpriced to the point that if you want to do anything other than play gta in your free time you cant afford it making multiplayer boring and not rewarding. Single player had mods but now that that is pretty much gone there is no point to purchasing this game.Inb4 paid mods
0;Let me start off by saying that I adore this game. However Rockstar has proven that they really could care less about the player base. They can't design an anticheat for their lives so they decide to issue a cease and desist to the biggest mod tool creator out there OpenIV. Now everyone who wanted to have fun in single player is screwed. Thanks for the fun game Rockstar but I'll think about supporting you as a company again once you decide to pull your heads out of your asses.
0;"""The game itself is good. But you should 100% Boycott this game until TakeTwo Interactive changes its modding policy as they have made not only multiplayer but singleplayer modding of the GTA V essentially illegal simply because they want to make sure theres no way around their cashgrabbing microtransaction filled hell hole of a multiplayer mode known as GTA Online and their cruddy shark card """"dlc"""". #Bringbackthemods"""
0;Want to fix the modder problem? Make a seperate sver for them rather then banning. Theres always gonna be people modding. Take Two pulled a move shutting down the FiveM and Citizen MP there has been nothing but pure greed in this game thanks to shark cards.
0;A lawsuit against modding... Really? Don't support a company that can't handle not having customers buy Shark Cards in which they would have never bought anyways. Oh and also don't ban innocent players who are given billions of dollars (me) just take it away
0;Modding does NOT enable piracy. Pirates enable piracy. Why punish your customers for something your non customers are doing or 'enabled' to do with OpenIV. Take Two get your together.Modding is a cornerstone of pc gaming and always will be. Some of the best games of all time were born from mods. Entire genres even...
0;Got it for 360....sucked. Got it for ps4.....Sucked. Got if for pc.....and guess what people this game blows. Never buy it cause you will just be led into depression at the fact that one shark card can buy one dlc car.....so either play endlessly which is impossible to do with this trash or mod money in and get banned.
0;This game just took roleplay servers away Open iv which lets you mod single player and have new cars. you take two you just ruined my fun the whole reason why i bought this game was for modding single player!0/10 i will give it a 10/10 if you get us the mods arleady!
0;im done with this game. apart from the main story line in single player mode the online mode is a complete waster of time. i've played this game for a long time but this last expansion completely destroyed whatever integrity the online multiplayer had left.
0;Here to do my part about Take Two Interactive and their horrible decision which is giving the big ol' middle finger to the modding community.Hopefully they can recognize their mistake and retract itGood on you for bringing back OpenIV bad on you for not allowing the Liberty City in GTA V mod.
0;Take note of all management at take two and black list them from support of any game in the future. I've never seen a company destroy the best part of a game so blatantly. greedy slimey and sad destruction of an amazing game with an amazing mod community.
0;Want my money back. So after spending many hours and becoming a legit billionaire twice playing GTA Xbox I decided to purchase GTA PC. My thought was the single player sucked and was boring so using mods I can make single player fun and having a monster PC I could use the high end graphics mods.Thanks for ruining that TakeTwo. Guess I will go back to Skyrim and Fallout.
0;After reading reviews about how people had their funds removed I didn't believe them so I decided to see for myself. I went to play GTAO today and first thing I saw was all my money 1.1mil removed from my account for no reason well maybe because I don't buy shark cards.
0;One of the reason why I bought GTA 5 on the PC is to ING MOD IT! i don't even play in multiplayer! why in the ing hell would you guys do this? for money?..I understand that you are a business and you need to make a profit but alienating your entire modding community is completely !. Mods keep the game fresh and alive even after their release! this is completely devastating extremely stupid move by take two. SO STUPID!!!!
0;I used to freaking love this game... Used to be huge rockstar lover... Then they disable the MODS? THE REASON WHY PEOPLE BUY THE PC EDITION OF GTA5? No I'm good rockstar. I will not be buying any more of your products until this is fixed just like this review will not be reverted until I can once again play with mods on Singleplayer.
0;Fun game too bad Rockstar has ensured it's failure to keep my attention consistently throughout the years with decisions. Removing Open IV mod support is the final straw. Instead they want to push everyone to the online mode so that you can forced to buy microtransactions in a game where a quarter of the servers I join have cheaters that just ruin the game anyways.
0;RIP GTA Redux. Really enjoyed this singleplayer graphics mod. Too bad Rockstar shutdown OpenIV because now it won't work along with several other mods. Bad decision on Rockstar's end becuase cheats will still find a way into online but several mods like this will just die.
0;If you played the game for a bit you know all the scummy R* and T2 did to this game. I quitted the MP due to all the overwhelming DLCs that requires you grind 10 hour to just get a brand new mediocre sportscar. I joined in the modding section of the game and soon quickly realized how much R* restricted the modding scene so they can force people to join MP. Please don't buy this and anymore T2 and R* products.
0;Take Two has essentially destroyed GTA IV GTA V and every other Rockstar title on PC that you can mod. They have actually ruined this game. It would be fine if it was free but it's 60 ing dollars. Take Two clearly thinks that that isn't enough money. I think they've made enough considering it's the 4th best selling game to ever be made. From all of the fans of modding you Take Two.
0;Buy this game only if You like very very long loading times both offline and online.You like to buy shark cards (paying real money for in game currency).You hate modding even in single player.You like to be **** in the *** by Take Two.Otherwise avoid at all costs.
0;TakeTwo is doing their best at destroying the GTA franchise both in multiplayer (grinding online for ages unless you fork over cash for the shark cards) and singleplayer (Banning modding and scrapping new singleplayer content in favor of multiplayer). I used to love GTA but the choices TakeTwo is making have resulted in me no longer being able to recommend this game. Sad.
0;Takes longer to join and start a game than the actual mission. Loading times are terrible. Worst possible way to join missions and difficult just to leave a mission. Hackers are in just about every lobby. I used to think this would be the greatest game but it quickly turned to worst. Find out yourself how terrible this game is. (Can be fun though)
0;Thank you R* for completely losing all fan loyalty. I bought this game 3 times first on the 360 second on the one and third on the PC. Now do you know why I bought it for the PC? TO MOD THATS WHY I BOUGHT IT FOR THE PC. Now it's apparent to me that I wasted $180 on a company that lynches their community for trying to add onto their game.
0;"""As if the community wasn't just cancer enough I've thrown 700+ hours into this game playing fairly and grinding my off for cars and etc. I got permabanned from GTA Online immediatly after a very understandable and fair temporary ban for exploiting (Which they still haven't patched ironically). I'm so glad I never spent a penny on this game's """"advertise it every week"""" cards and don't bother being exicted for any of the new content its the same copy and paste CEO work style missions."""
0;Take2 blocked modding how many people buy this game for online? Exactly it's a modders haven and they just cut off the main mod. Stop trying to ram your stupid microtransactions down our ing throats just because my 60 wasn't enough for you you greedy bastards.
0;In all honesty I feel like TakeTwo's attempt at suppressing modding is unreasonable. They have failed to provide singleplayer dlc themselves so why stop people from modding the game and enjoying the single player that way? I could write so much about the subject but I feel like many other reviews here have summarized it all up well enough so that there isn't a need to.
0;Dont bother buying unless Take Two Interactive get there act together biggest mistake banning OpenIV. Didnt affect the online at all just a poor attempt and getting players to the play the online to pay microtransactions for there creations. Silencing creative effort.
0;Product received for free. No mod no cheat no nothing.Still got banned and cant appeal.10/10 Skin my ban from second ban to third ban permanently.My ban is should be second ban when I ban second time but you skip to third ban.What a thug life Dev game I ever seen.
0;Everything about the core gameplay in GTA V is amazing and warrents the highest of praise. It will not recieve this however until a very particular problem is addressed. Micro transactions need to be removed and modding needs to be encouraged. GTA V has entertained me for many hours but I cannot continue to support a game if the publishers don't support the community.
0;Until Fake2 fixes this mess and gives OpenIV a seal of approval with an apology I recommend you not buy this game However I would strongly advice you get ahold of GTA4 and GTA San Andreas. At least with those products you have the freedom to have your own custom fun. Please be apart of the gaming revolution to save OpenIV.
0;the only reason i bought this game was so that i could mod it and get constant updates. The online experinece is total crap given that you have to grind hours out of your life to make cash to buy new vehicles is absurd .no one has enough time or encough cash to throw around on sharkcards to do so...and given the recent events of openIv being banned and rockstar constantly screwing us over i feel like i should have stuck with the pirated version
0;I don't usually get on bandwagons. I usually don't even leave useful reviews. But given I've always loved to mod GTA all the way since Vice City. And given I bought this one and all the ones in between because I knew how much fun I'll have with modding it. And because there is a whole lot of people who love mods I'm more than pleased to be a part of this group condemnation. What a way to ruin a good thing. Take Two needs to get their together.
0;"""I'm leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team. OpenIV is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE ammount of mods for Gta V and Gta IV. Basically modding is """"illegal"""" so I am leaving this negative review. The game is okay but this """"No Modding Policy"""" is ridiculous and I will not stand for it."""
0;From making Claude skins in GTA3 to multiplayer RPG mods of GTA SA this is the end of an era. The publisher of this game is a money hogging bully who has jumped aboard the anti modding train. Lets hope all these negative reviews cause them to lose revenue.
0;I bought the game on PC because i loved in on my xbox 360 but when i started playing online here hackers everywhere.First i got money and i thought nice.Then i became a wheelchair/tree and i thought cool.Then i became and octopus and got 200 NPC stuck in my body and my game crashed.PLS FIX THIS GAME ROCKSTAR
0;On behalf of the OpenIV team. Take Two can go f**k themselves and there money hungry minds. GTA Online was once good but now is hell on earth filled with satans minion microtranactions. The only great thing left was the singleplayer and its modding but Take Two didnt like that and thought a cease and desist would fuel there addiction of shark cards. Wrong move guys the modding community is coming back with a vengence....
0;Don't buy this game. Don't. And to those who already have it stop playing it. Take Two just sent a cease and desist to the creators of OpenIV a base mod you need for just about half of all of the mods for GTA V (and IV). So effectively they're trying to kill the modding community. Go yourself Take Two. Seriously go yourself.
0;Before the start now this game isnt bad its a masterpiece.But if you read the news Take Two has just banned the single player modding community.Which means kill creativity. And no its not Rockstar fault I highly respect them as one the most best game dev.I myself rarely use mods now but I enjoy times when you can mod freely at single player and I think its not a badidea and it add more life to the game.Might take the negative review if the ban has been lifted though.
0;I played this games for years but then i suddenly get hit with the banhammer... Waited and litteraly a day after i got unbanned the hammer hits again. Tries support but they honestly don't give a single . off... Honestly just off. I mean what the are we doing here?
0;They specifically shut down single player mods to try to push people to go spend money on the micro transaction infested multiplayer. Multiplayer is trash with a bunch of half baked ideas every week the fun in the game is in the single player. Where you can no longer run the vast majority of mods.0/10
0;I started playing the GTA series when San Andreas was out and modded the heck out of this game. Played the online version ( SAMP ) which was an amazing mod and it drew thousands of people into the game.Now you want to block and go after the modders who make ( for free generally ) tons of content for your game? Draw people to keep playing your game? you. you T2.
0;Well here we goThe game itself is awesome. I played with friends since the PS3 edition on friends only but one day i decided to go online and i got reported because of counter sniping a stupid kid who shouldn't even be allowed to play. I had friends who got banned for nothing so i expect to say goodbye to gta online.Overall i DO NOT recomand this game. Don't waste your money for getting banned for no real reason.
0;Exceedingly long load times even with an SSD frequent crashes and updates causing the game to play worse over the years. No effort to protect the community and then they go and attack their own community. This is how GTA ends with thundreous downvotes.
0;Take Two has literally axed a loyal and life long community. All the Hulk Ironman new cars new weapon skins mods have been killed due to the shutdown of OPENIV. Openiv was the lifeblood of many spectacular mods and amazing creativity for their singleplayer fun. Due to greed and false reasoning the GTA franchise is on a path of focal microtransactions and online play.
0;Everyone that uses OpenIV hates you!!! ALLOW MODDING!!!Take two is just screwing everyone out of money This game is horrible that we cannot use mods &gt (F**k You Guyshttp //www.rockstargames.com/legalThe TERMS AND CONDITIONS clearly state nothing of modding is not allowed Clearly. Why is rockstar and take two closing down.
0;Seriously f*ck Take Two. One of the biggest appeals of this game on PC was the modding community and now you've removed one of the largest modding tools available.Not only that but the online has been absolutely for a long time now thanks to the inordinate amount of microtransactions that have been piled on to it.
0;So many hacker ruining online. They wont fix this they'll instead ruin any form of modding and limit what you can get in single player (such as cars and jets) to try and force you to their hacker full micro transaction grind fest. They just want your money
0;Oh Take Two. You really ed Rockstar. You've made plenty off this game. Your fan base only really sticks around BECAUSE of mods to be honest (And the 'free' updates which are usually only OBTAINABLE by modding money because it is REDICUOULSLY expenseive.) Oh well. I was banned a few months ago anyway good thing I did not buy another copy! (See? You could of had me buy the game AGAIN instead of banning mods. Shame. SHAME!
0;The singleplayer is good but they're really trying to sap you for all the money you have in the multiplayer which in turn made it into a boring grindy mess. Only fun if you have friends to play with not recommended otherwise. Oh and they're outright ing over mod authors to drive people to the rubbish multiplayer thats just not on.
0;"""""""One of the things we learned pretty early on is 'Don't ever ever try to lie to the internet because they will catch you.'"""" Gabe Newell.Take Two you are liars and you just miffed off quite possibly the most dedicated part of the gaming community. The Modders."""
0;When will Rockstar learn that sure they made a big game with lots of stuff to do but none of that is fun or rewarding? The The modding community kept this game alive more than any of your seasoned updates with outrageously priced toys ever did. You had a gem and you turned it into a mud clod. Great job.Sincerely Every GTA V Owner ever.

0;"""It's one thing to fight Online modding but to kill Story Mode mods at the same time """"Creation Club"""" gets announced it's hard not to correlate this to a money grab T2 has been doing since Shark Cards became a thing. Looks like no Red Dead 2 for me either."""
0;On the whole a great game I ve put over 200 hours into it and loved it. Only one problem I let me kids play it last weekend with their cousin and they managed to do something in game that resulted in a permanent ban from Rock Star on my account. Thanks boys!When I tried to contact Rock Star despite having been a GTA player since the 2nd one their attitude was basically F.U. so that s probably the last time I ll be spending money on a Rock Star game. Other than that its great.
0;The very worse in greedy microtransaction business practices. It's a shame the single player story is fun but hasn't been developped since release.Couple this with the fact the recent actions of the publisher are extremely anti modding and I just can't support this company or it's publisher. Welcome to my blacklist guys.
0;2K's recent decision to order a cease and desisit on the main mod sucks for so many people. So many people bought this game for a second or even third time like me so that they could play with the PC mods. I have played across the other versions over 1250 hours and whole heartedly recommend the game however I cannot recommend the steam version due to this recent decision.And the general servers are full of hackers.
0;"""Loved the game but had to stop playing because it was literally impossible to connect and stay connected with friends. We all have great internet we port forwarded took off any and all firewalls and virus protection. Nothing works. So much for being a great """"multiplayer"""" game."""
0;Take two interactive killed the game by increasing micro transactions and banning any mods including single player. Also fair to mention that they took away all of my in game money which was hours of grinding the game because they thought I was hacking to get it. Now I have a useless $60 game sitting in my library. Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this game. Not even worth $1 anymore.
0;All im going to say after 300+ hours of playing is this. Do not buy this game for you kids. Kids are immature. The game is very real. Kids cause toxicity and make the untolerable. Most modders are kids. Dont buy this game if you are either tired of cancerous communities or under the age of 18.
0;I've put only about 200 hours in this version but about 400 hours in FIveM using GTAV. But now since apparently it's illegal to mod all of the fun is going to be taken away. No more single player flying around as iron man shooting cars. No more changing to a monkey and walking down the highway with a minigun ripping into cars. Just plain ol boring a single player bland gameplay. Way to shoot yourself in the foot!
0;Take two banning OpenIV and modding in singelplayer. shows how bad Rockstar is treating their players. First they ruined online and now singelplayer.I will never buy a game from Rockstar again. I hope all the other players do the same. All players out there please boycott Rockstar in every single way you can. 1. Stop buying their games and shark cards.2. Make bad reviews on their games.3. Tell others how bad rockstar is treating their players.4. Spam rockstar on their social media.
0;Okay so the game itself is amazing! 9 outta 10. The only real complaints I have are some of the people in GTA Online and everything costing a ridiculous amount there as well.On to the real reason I'm posting this so Take Two Interactive just basically declared modding illegal (even though it's not and protected under fair use) and me and everyone are understandably Take Two give us our mods back
0;Take Two is a money hungry team. Companies who send cease &amp decist notices to modders are not publishers who should be supported. Modding is what kept this game alive with no singleplayer DLC modding add so much fun to the game. After purchasing the game twice and putting over 1 000 hours in it's time to step away. Devs shouldn't soley be focued on online content and microtransactions. A good community makes a good game and that was just killed by the publisher can't recommend this game.
0;The cease and desist order given to Open IV by Take Two basically kills the modding community. This order was likely an attempt to push more players onto the online section of this game so that Take Two can make more money. Take Two's decision to destroy the work of the Open IV team just to make more money is despicable.I will never again spend any money on a Take Two game and I encourage everyone who has or is considering purchasing a Take Two game to abstain from supporting Take Two as well.
0;I can't play this game. Rockstar has disabled my old GTA IV Social Account (which I haven't used for years) because someone attempted to login to my account too many times. This person was obviously not myself.Now I cannot create a new account because the old account is tied to my Steam account. My original account is closed and cannot be used leaving me completely in limbo.It's impossible for me to play the game through no fault of my own. Nice work Rockstar. Thank you.
0;I loved this game the mods and enjoyment I got out of it before yesterday but now thanks to take a interactive the mods will no longer be viable or possible without openIV which they threatened a suite against because of single player modifacations which I think they don't realize kept games like GTA SA AND IV going for years after there supposed death time you Take two and your you micro transaction dump.GET A REFUND FOR GTA V
0;Take Two Interactive has backed off from GTA V modders but the damage to their reputation is already done. It is still blatantly obvious that all they care about is money with how they keep coming with updates and new content for the online microtransactions while doing nothing about the ever present population of hackers that ruin the experience for everyone else.With the current online experience and pricing I can not in good conscience recommend this game.
0;The game is fantastic. Their anti cheat and the online hackers is poor. I was turned into a boulder by a hacker and I was promptly banned. They could do nothing to overturn my ban. When my ban was over they had taken all my in game cash. Their anti cheat system is so poor that it bans people who were targeted by hackers.This could have been the best online game.
0;"""Removal of modding tools declaring OpenIV """"illegal"""" is the worst thing that T2 could have done and have removed a major selling point for the game on PC. This will hurt the GTA community I do not recommend buying this game if you plan to use mods considering they destroyed the modding community. Also be prepared to be swarmed with micro transactions in the buggy multiplayer where there are constantly hackers."""
0;This game will ban players suddenly for no reasons.I have not cheated not bugged and also buy the shark card for 8M.But I got banned yesterday for no reasons.Thus please don't buy this game even the discount given by steam is 99% off.Since you will get banned in the coming days for no reason.Also this action from R star has already violate the new signed law 362 in Hong Kong. I believe the Hong Kong custom department will do action in the coming days.
0;Loads up GTA V gets sucked into the drama and awesomeness of the singleplayer world.Finally finish the single player and decide to give Online a try realise everyone was so inspired by Trevor and kills you on sight. also i got banned for nothing with a Character reset so theres that.Singleplayer is amazing Multiplayer is not.
0;Wtf 2k? You take modding because it doesn't make you money? Well boo hoo it's not like you made BILLIONS from the game. You have basically killed the almost half of the PC GTA 5 community so for that I give you a middle finger and a bag of that is your online...
0;All of the DLC that would have been in this game has been removed to force people to buy more shark cards. Mods were that DLC we never got. So by removing mods in a very shady and dubious manner Take Two obviously doesnt care about the people that paid for this game and play it.
0;AROUND 1300 HOURS PLAYED MODDED SINGLEPLAYER WITH GOD DAMN MODS (INSANE GRAPHIC HQ CARS AMAZING SCRIPTS AND TRAINERS). DONT CARE ABOUT USELESS TRASH UPDATES ON IT ONLINE. I BOUGHT A MONSTER PC FOR RUN IT FINE AND MAKE 4K CAR SHOWCASES TAKE2 TAKE MY IN YOUR MOUTH HOPE YOU GUYS GET DDOS SO HARD AND GET BILLION NEGATIVE COMMENTS LIKE THIS ONE HOPE YOU GUYS STOP IT AND GET SOME HELP UGLY S REST IN PIECE MY HOBBY THANKS FOR THE ING ATTENTION DUMB
0;Was fun about 4 years ago but their obsession with MORE money and use of Microtransactions is strangling the player base and leaving everybody behin who refuses to fork out ridiculous amounts of money for overpriced content. Their disregard for the modding community was the final nail.
0;Rockstar is taking away our money in game adding more expensive things in the game that we can't even buy becuase our money has been taken away so we have to sell our massive amount of cars just to try out the new stuff. you rockstar your game is good but why must it be so much money and the missions give so little pay there a huge unbalance.
0;Take Two Interactive totally f***ed over the GTA community know what GTA4's multiplayer made it even worth playing (yes the core multiplayer S***ED a**)? Exactly the mods and trainers. And now they are taking down OpenIV that doesn't even enable you to mod the multiplayer and is singleplayer ONLY?! Take Two Interactive is a money s***ing b**** company and I will NEVER buy a game that is in any way related to that company ever again. F*** RDR2 and f*** GTA6 even more.
0;They have made it illegal to mod with Open IV which lots of mods are based on. Modding is why many of us on pc even buy the game myself included. Not to mention how bad online is with inflated prices and the ever so increasing grinds to get the most basic things such as the new car or new property.
0;For open Iv game is uninstalled till the cease and desist goes away because take two want to push people into the online which is fun but not as fun as the single layer at mods its about as close as the sun is to neptune so screw this game until its allows open iv back
0;This is a good game in general nice graphics amazing gameplay and a wonderful story mode. Online however has many bugs and I was suspended from the game for a month with all my vehicles and money reset. I do not know what has caused the suspension however I do not recommend the game if you want to play Online. And R* Support is garbage.GGWP
0;500 hours would not reccomend. Rockstar is a good company but they're throwing all their chips into online play which is fine but their stance on modding is hindering single player which is how this franchise began. Given the current stance in online and the ever moving push for players to buy their card sharks while power creep is a major concern I would skip this.
0;Bad company only after money I mean an 8millon card is 89. My mates were given 10x that in hacked lobby's. They all kept there money. Company is unfair only after money and dlc money. Also they hate there community... Uninstalled good thing battlegrounds is out. Now there is a decent game. Really wish I could get my money back from these scum
0;Apparently when you grind ceo busines' like a maniac rockstar bans you i gave a positive review before but all my work has been undone by rockstar all those months of grinding and they take all that away and give me 8m i bought with the game. Stick that 8m up your br&gt Plus its full of ing modders
0;to enjoy the new content you will have to play the same mission over and over days after day to buy 1 car that you might not like in the end..... or pay a lot of money again and again.How about you let us enjoy the game that we paid a lot for in the first place !
0;Game was fun and there seems to be a good mod community. Installed several wonderful mods and then a ROCKSTAR PATCH DESTROYED ANY POSSIBILITY OF PLAYING THE GAME.There is simply no reason to make it so that mods corrupt single player savefiles except being malicious. Do not buy a game from such a toxic company if you can avoid it. There are many good games out there this one is not worth it.
0;I bought this game enjoyed the singleplayer. Went into multiplayer and a hacker maxed me out instantly. I enjoyed it for about a day. Then it was modding lots and lots of it. NOW THEY WANT TO STOP MODDING?? This is the stupidest deciscion they could've made. And I hope we let them know with these negative reviews. Fun game but only to mod!
0;Got banned for accidently having single player trainer running while going online. (Was trying out new trainers for single player tihs one didn't even work but apparently still counted as a running file.)Sent a message to Rockstar support. Got in a fraction of a second an automated response telling me the same thing the last one did.10/10 customer support would lose 60 dollars again to crappy customer service.
0;Anytime there is a good DLC out they nerf it down to EX Bunker DLC the beginning profit was 10K by default with all the upgrades over 12K. After the nerf the bunker produces 12K max with ALL upgrades. Rockstar Please Fix this to a more reasonable amount.
0;The cheaters and hackers in every single lobby make this game nearly unplayable. The single player is great. The multiplayer would be great if there wasn't a salty teenager who will spawn explosives/clones of your character/aircraft/cars until your game crashes everytime they die.
0;The game is not longer fun to play they keep adding these packs that are supposed to make the game more fun and allow you to make more money but to use these add ons you must have money in the first place which is hard to get and the game needs mods to make it more fun.
0;You could call it dead... killed by Rockstar themself lol what a bunch of greedy in suits...oh and dont tell me this is on Take2 only u are in Rockstar u on Take2 if u wish...greedy t.w.a.t.son a side note single player is somewhere between rock solid and amazing

0;Modding was the reason I bought this game on PC in first place. They don't do sh**t about the ones that actually destroy the game but instead they're treating modders like sc*m who are witnesing their precious time making the game better and better with every mod. Thank You for nothing Take2. I still wish I could refund this game and give the money to hard working modder instead. (Of course the devs are not responsible for the sh*t Take2 f*cked up.)
0;The singleplayer is a fantastic experience but the multiplayer is a microtransaction ridden hellhole. Oh and also as of the writing of this review the publisher killed OpenIV and with it most of the modding scene directly stating that it was to sell more microtransactions. So there's that too. Have my downvote Take Two.
0;Don't buy this if you're looking to mod single player. Take Two Interactive is crying over the fact they can't fix a rampant problem that has plauged this game's online for 3 years now and decides to take it out on the innocent gamers... Save your money for dinner or something.
0;"""On behalf of the ENTIRE GTAV modding community you Take Two you money grabbing """"Ooooh I've come up with a new marketing scheme! Let's make modding GTAV illegal and push all those single player mod users into the multiplayer which is our very own microtransaction where buying money makes more sense than trying to earn it ingame!"""" . You."""
0;THIS GAME IS BROKEN.... no mods supports hackers everywhere shity community boring no new solo missions... want me to continue?R.I.P. GTA V (PC)2015 2017time to go back to gta vice city (my favorite)EDIT Please everyone ask for a refund for this game.
0;Single player is alright they have ruined the multiplayer with pay to play mechanics. Mods are dead which means this game is pretty much dead at this point Rockstar North is a great developer but Take Two can suck a massive one. They clearly don't care about fans and only care about money.TL DROnly buy if you only want single player multiplayer is full of hackers so you'll either get banned due to no fault of your own or just get warped and killed in lobbies.
0;There's no point in buying or owning GTA V anymore thanks to Take Two's recent actions. Unless they fix their I'm never buying any of their games ever again. 0/10 Can never mod again.EDIT Can mod again but hackers everywhere! Maybe try learning to play instead of making yourself invincible online you s.
0;Single player modding was the only reason I bought this game. This game costs USD$75 in Australia and I think it's a bit rubbish that they're sending cease and desist letters to the people keeping their game alive for customers that have purchased it. I can genuinely say I will avoid this company in the future very disappointed.
0;"""Are you looking for a game that claims to release """"free DLC"""" but the free isnt really free because of how overly expensive the """"FREE"""" DLC is? Are you looking to spend over $500 of real money or ready to grind GTA currency for months for a few of the new DLC vehicles and ready to hop into an extremely unbalanced multiplayer expierence? If you answered yes to any of those questions GTA is the perfect choice for you than."""
0;I recently got banned for forgetting I had my single player mods kept in my files when I went over to online I got banned for a month and when I came back R* deleted 500 hours of my two online characters. I will probably never play this game again because R* made it clear they wont give the characters back. Long story short . You. Rockstar. If you ruin Red Dead Redemption 2 I will on your grave )
0;I will no longer be playing this game due to the Single Player aspect of the game not allowing mods and Take Two Interactive declaring that modding of their files is an illegal act. This is a despicable asbuse of power and I will not be purchasing another Take Two Interactive game as long as this ignorant policy is in place. I hope your games are often played by everyone but NEVER purchased. You deserve it !
0;If you want to buy this game to mod it like you used to do in GTA4 and so on DONT! You can no longer mod on this game in the single player due to the parent company of Rockstar wanting to squeeze us our of money in the multiplayer. DONT. BUY. THIS. GAME!
0;Love this game Hate having to call tech support every other week cause the game just doesnt work properly. ive been force to redownload the whole game at least twice to fix issues and most recently am having to reinstall the game when its already installed on my computer
0;GTA a game that has reaped the benefits from having mod support desicdes now that they are a korean MMO with shark card this and grind heavy that.Going after the mod community who work there off to make your game better out of nothing but passion for the game.Gta mocks the abusive capitilistic mentality of todays world.The irony that now you are what you mock.thank you rockstar.
0;https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivAlso things are way too expensive in GTA Online. I'm above level 300 and still struggle with GTAdollars. Things are WAY too expensive compared to what you earn. It's almost as they have put in consideration the money given by a cheater to calculate the current prices in game. It's rediculous and it's easy to say the economy is ed.
0;Its Grand Theft Auto ing get it ffs Job well done Rockstar another masterpiece.EDIT 6/18 Nope nope nope you ed up like the other reviewer says you ban our community we ban your incomeBring back modding if you ever want to try to regain back your faithful customers you morons.
0;This negative review is on behalf of OpenIV. you Take Two Interactive for killing GTA modding. Oh and they don't give a about the fact that the DLC system is so GODDAMN BROKEN. When you buy the oh so well promised and very good Criminal Enterprice Starter Pack it installs fine but alas it doesn't work!
0;Singleplayer is alright.Multiplayer though The game should be renamed to Grind That That's all you'll be doing. Grinding money from jobs that pay out around 10k if you're lucky and are high up on the leaderboard just for the newest 2 4 million car.A Free Korean MMO has less grind Go play one of those instead.
0;Cannot leave a positive review due to the fact that I never had a chance to try the single player mods and the online mutiplayer requires you to be Bill Gates to enjoy it. Don't buy this game until it goes on sale for 90% of otherwise the game is a waste of money.
0;Online play is infested with hackers impossible to play one day without them ruining the game. Until rockstar fixes online mode with good old ban wave I would not recommend it for anyone.If you are however looking to only play singleplayer you will have a blast of a time.
0;I like this game very much and its pretty fun to play with friends but the multiplayer mode needs to be improved. Please allow mods to be used online in a different lobby just like in GTA IV. I also do not like how the price has been raised just before the Summer Sale thats just mean and greedy. Therefore I leave a negative review because this behavior should not be encouraged
0;One of the worst launches of this decade (typical Rockstar) but once they fixed the game up.. it actually ran pretty well. Decent game with a lot of content.However 200 hours into the game it has reverted to killer problems and it will not run at all. I've reinstalled it tried all fixes and it simply does not function.Do not recommend unless Rockstar fixes it
0;The reason we all bought this game was for modding. No one here enjoys GTA online and no one here is willing to shell out hundreds of dollars on shark cards just to get new vehicles that are enjoyable for about an hour. With the killing off of OpenIV you have killed off the majority of your player base on PC. Good job. I won't recommend your future products or GTA V to anyone.
0;Nobody likes you Take 2.We all say boo to you.You kill our freedom you take our mods.You treat us like a bunch of tods.We want our mods back Take 2.We want to drive a Ford.We want to play as Iron Man.But after this horde of mod killers Take 2 set a ban.I ran and ran.But Take 2 threw me into a kidnapping van.I was threatened to never mod but with the lawyers taking me to court I had to nod.What shall I do now? Play CoD?Take 2 are cows. Take 2 are frauds.
0;online games impossible created by other players.making you never to complete a mission.within 10 minutes 20 times death by other players.is no fun in the online version.leaving only singel play remains. but I buy this not for singelplay. the Xbox version is better than the pc version.the single version is top no comment on it just super.I have gotten my money back which I find also super.
0;"""Take Two had their lawyers sent a C and D letter to the creators of a massive single player mod that is needed for most fun modding. Don't buy this game if you plan to mod single player. Online if you want to """"mod"""" there are still plenty of hackers as well. Online is also garbage if you don't want to pay and takes for ever to find a heist or any mission."""
0;bought this game a few days a go and installed it i was soooo disappointed the game crashed in the loading screen it only runs in safe mode and i have a system that is more than capable to run it this system was even built to play this game.system specs i7 4790 kz97a gaming 7msi gtx 980 ti16 gb kingston savage
0;Never used a mod yet for GTA but I use them for other games. Banning a mod tool after allowing mods for 10 years in GTA games is ridiculous. Take Two Interactive don't care about anything you think or say unless you're constantly putting money in their pocket.
0;Broken game. only when it came out for the pc it was fun. After a while Rockstar began to put their AntiHack system... the gamestarted to suck very badly. im playing on a high graphics card and I have 40 FPS.boring game with suck graphics before their updates I ran the game on ULTRA and is was smooth.fu*k you Rockstar. thanks for the broken game.
0;after long hours of playing the game is boring a lot and you may find in every server 1 or 2 hackers at least if you were lucky and joined a server without hackers there is nothing to do after finishing the hiest and the missions over and over and over ...
0;This is a great game.A great game that is completely and utterly destroyed by bugs connection issues massive amounts of hackers and persistent crashes.Rockstar support were no use whatsoever. DO NOT BUY THIS ON PC. If you must get it buy it for Xbone or PS4.
0;the game itself is ok but the loading time ...OMG id play more but everytime i play this game i get annoyed by several minutes of loading time every time u finish a mission. it takes the fun out of the game for me pls fix or i wasted 60 euros on a game that i cant play casue of poor server performance
0;Modding has always been a great part of GTA and it's sad to see Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games take this direction against it. Hopefully someday we can see that the modding community and the game developers can unite. (like we seen in several other games (Minecraft The Elder Scrolls Series)
0;Would I recommend this game? Yes and No.Do I like this game? Yes and No.Why do I think this? Its simple Gta 5 Single player story 10/10 Gta 5 Online 1/10Its almost like this game is two seperate games and the one was great success while the other is a pile of rubbish.
0;IM korean this time i say that flag of japs.If you using that criminal flag put in nach's flag with them!You already knowing korean Chinese ing hate japs criminal flagsPlz making better place of GTA world. Canceld that japan criminal flag.Just request for everyone for the entire asia.
0;This modding thing is outrageous. Respect for Rockstar for standing up to TakeTwo their publisher about this insane decision to completely ban singleplayer modding all while random godmode users continue to make every single user in public lobbies explode spontaneously.
0;Started banning people and issuing cease and desists to make more money out of their already super successful game. Bad move take two mods are what add longer playability to games. Take skyrim for example big reason it's still so popular is mods. Sure multiplayer modding is bad but this was a step too far.
0;Please do not buy this game. They have removed the ability to mod the game. They did this under the guise that they were cleaning up hackers online. However the application they sent their C&amp D to would not allow you to take the game online and crashed the game on purpose when you tried.
0;Great port performance wiseSadly multiplayer wise its a straight port of the console miniature scale networking. Want 15v15 deathmatches? Good luck the auto mm puts you into a 2v2 or 3v3. There is no lobby to find the full games the console MM that was straight ported to PC puzzles together these 3v3 matches exclusively.GTA IV did multiplayer better than GTA V for PC.... can you believe that?
0;GTA V was a really good game but it is disgusting how they treat there community thats why I would not reccomend this Game. It is bassically P2W with completely overpriceed shark Cards and a lot of hackers. I think we can all agree that hacking in online destroyes the Game but shutting down Open IV wich has absolutely nothing to do with online is just a huge step against the community.
0;Cease and disist on one of the essential mods for singleplayer meaning that a huge amount of the current singleplayer mods will be unusable and to play as any sort of silly character or to use the new cars you will have to buy them in the online mode as they aren't in the single player at all. They're getting greedy with micro transactions and the multiplayer suffers because of it.
0;Take two are greedy scumbags for shutting down Open IV &amp Force. Listen the problem here is that their greed affects the online play. Everything is ridiculously expensive and money is hard to earn in this game and its all to persuade sharkcard sales. microtransactions and take two
0;Game is good in SP but really crap online. Often hackers spoil the fun takes a crazy long time to get a good amount of money.And the loading times are also long. Last time starting online was over two minutes and still loading.Gave up won't be trying again.
0;if you are like many people and want to get this game for the hilarious and thrilling single player mods but still be able to play online you'll be disappointed. I installed a single player mod (to make my character look like batman) never even used it but still got banned from online. and there's no easy way to contact rockstar to get this mess figured out.it's fun apart from this though.
0;HELLLLLLL NAH!!!!!!!!!!! 60 BUCKS FOR A # YEAR OLD GAME THE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i bought it a while ago on sale and it was expensive then but theres no reason this game should still be 60 dollars since even if u get it ur gonna have to either grind ur off or spend hundreds of dollars on shark cards to get ONE car............ this game!
0;I have played a good amount of GTA V and I love the death out of it however the bugs &amp crashes make just quit playing a lot of the time and the loading is outrageous. Not to mention all the other issues people have had with it it just doesn't justify $70 for no fixes and no real content releases.
0;Only reason this game has long term survivability is mods without them this game is worth the pirate to finish the story multiplayer gets stale over time and the launch of big expansions that take 30 hours to get literally everything in the dlc mods kept multiplayer and single player fun and exciting because it helped make the game into a different game bad game no mods.
0;honestly aside from the t money grabbing nature of it all its still not even that good of a game. are you willing to grind in a game in which a grind of any kind makes no ing sense? good! sign up here!soon any money making method other than buying shark cards will be banned xD
0;It would be a positive review taking in consideration the time i put in this game and the fun i got out of it. This fun was partially due to the modding community but since you're trying to destroy it you deserve all the negative reviews you get. Won't be paying for any game affiliated with Take Two.
0;I love the game but there's no point paying the ridiculous full price for a game that's barely any different to how it was on the PS3/xbox360. Online is still broken with frequent errors and dropping of sessions something I would've hoped they'd have fixed for a steam release.If you want this just for the superb single player I'd pick it up anywhere else at a cheaper price as it's still the same.
0;Sadly this game is full of hackers the singleplayer is where the meats at. Avoid multiplayer at all costs it s horrible and Rockstar is doing nothing to fix the hacking.I can t give this game more than 5/10 Rockstar should learn from this mistake with multiplayer and learn to implement it better in the next GTA and have an anti cheat system.
0;DO NOT buy this to mod it Take Two Interactive recently killed the modding scene for this game. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY DO NOT BUY THIS PILE OF WANK.The game is good but I can't recomend it is Take Two are going to be colossal Spread the word of this crap to anyone looking to buy this game
0;If you wlike spending your day trying to find a server you don't get kicked from gta online is for you. If you want a refund for this game because you never found a server too bad you should have given up trying to find a server earlier. gta online 0/10 steam refund policy 0/10.
0;I'm tired of rockstar ruining my fun with mods.If they werent such cash cows stampeding modders because their worried they're gonna get less sales on shark cards they can do more reaseach next time on if its a single player or multiplayer mod first.Sucks because they game is fun but until rockstar can pull their tail from behind their butt I have to rate this game poorly.
0;This game is so full of hackers that it makes it almost unplayable. Hackers can tp you go god mode give themselves money both making themselves a litertal god and belittling everything else a player does in this game. No progress is worth anything since there will always be a hacker there waiting to kill you at the next stop
0;Don't get me wrong the story is great but on the other hand online is where it gets really bad. They ban random people for no reason at all and you can't get any support because it's just a bot with automated messages and the point of online is for them to make it extremely hard to make money. Like it takes a LONG time. This is basically their way of getting you to spend money on shark cards. 6/10
0;Positives Runs fairly well Fun storyNegatives Online is absolute garbage Modding single player is ridiculously annoying Boring as hell once you've completed the main story Kiddies online like to hack and blow you up inside your apartmentNot worth it guys play MTA or SA MP instead
0;banned several times for just being on the same server as someone whos modding. won't buy a rockstar games ever again. rockstar should understand that banning people permanently in a game that costs 60 dollars is an unacceptable reaction to people using dumb mods. oh well.
0;Got banned online after a modder force fed me dead bodies of myself giving me money.Thanks for the no reason perma ban.EDIT The game is ing riddled with over expensive microtransactions and now they get rid of the modding community. What a bunch of ing Jews.
0;F*** this s*** killing the only reason to buy this!? WHY!? Killing the modding community (the good one not the gta online modders) this bulls*** has sooooooooooooooooooo much more problems than f***ing harmless mods!There is NO reason at all to buy thisMaybe the campaign but everybody has played it.Sadly the satire in the game reflects the game itself.If you dont want to grind for days and not be able to play anything else just to get some yacht then you know its ed up!
0;This game used to be good but now it is just take two's cash cow and they have completely ruined GTA 5 and GTA online. The hole game is based around shark cards. It is stupid and the game is full of hackers. The story is boring now and we can't use single player mods. Overall game.
0;"""The story is all right but online is just a deathmatch. There is no more fun lying within the game. Now that modding and OpenIV has been banned it just gets worse. Rockstar and Take Two ruined the game with repetitive gameplay and DLC's that just try to keep their game alive. With modding gone it just gets worse. They declaired fair use as being illegal and now its our turn to ruin their income. """"You ban our mods. We ban your income!""""Update Better now but still a game"""
0;Take Two really showed us where there priorities are this week. Shutting down the one and only true way to mod the single player (it doesn't even function with MP) just because they can afraid of anything that could affect their precious shark card microtrannies. They don't even realize what they've done and I'm finished supporting their greed. Don't buy this game.
0;Good mechanics good graphics good story modeOnline is awful and isn't worth playingDon't buy Shark Cards please it just encourages more developers to integrate and push microtransactionsAlso don't grind the game to make money because then you're a schlubTherefore don't buy anything expensive or interestingTherefore don't play Online (If you buy this game you're going to though guaranteed)
0;it is a good game iv been waiting for the discount but after that i joined the online its good but if they do somthing about the ing hackers would be goodme and my friend playing and boom dead what happind nothing just a hacker joind and killed evryonei dont recommend it new but when its fixed it will be very good
0;If you are looking for a Single Player game look no where else. It is a enjoyable experience to be had. The online play is pretty much HACKED to death. I wouldn't even bother at this point. Sixty DOllars for the same game we bought two years ago Not worth it.
0;"""Everyone enjoy the epic story. What about GTAOL? A combination of Bug simulator and the Cloud simulator. Really worthy when you like sky or clouds but wait you get more free DLC! Like the hacker simulator(you are the one who always die) rage simulator. The only good things is that when you finish """"enjoy"""" the luxury life in the game you soon fell boredom. Then you might spend some time on the real life. sometimes I would rather play job simulator"""
0;This is on behalf of OpenIV. you Take Two!Let's all stand together against take the interactive and this type of behaviourEDIT They've retracted the cease and desist but the fact that it still happened ismore than enough to warrant a negative review. The online portion of the game is filled with kids and hackers that rage and scream if you look at them funny. GTA 5 and Take Two
0;"""I haven't gotten banned but I can't even play the damn game! It keeps saying """"GTA V.exe not found when it's in the games directory even after verifying files and reinstalling the game numerous times. I've had the game for probably about 2 years and this has never happened but now that it has I'm Rockstar you really need to get your together because it's getting pathetic at this point."""
0;It's not a GTA anymore it's a Saints Row with a f*ckton of microtransactions and paid unlocks. It's because of this game RDR2 will most likely have the same online mode where you have to pay fifty bucks to buy a stallion with gatling gun on it and whatnot. Go to hell Take Two!
0;Rockstar are stupidly greedy for including microtransactions in an already fully priced game and removing mods was really the drop that ruined it all. The game is actually rather boring if you dont spend loads of cash in the online version or if you play with mods. Would not recomend.
0;The publishers are attacking every single mod that replicates a GTA Online experience so they can make more money. Now with the recent shutdown of OpenIV they also purged the future of single player mods as well. I wouldn't recommend this game until they shift their focus off of the money and onto the community.
0;So because they started making all of their oun mods to the game they stiff arm the modding community to get rid of the compition. I see what you did there. Stop being greedy . This is why the world seems ed right now its all because of money. Money is the easiest way to get someone to inslave themselves.
0;UPDATED Not worth it for the story mode. GTA online is a pile of garbage.The whole game takes like 5 15 minutes to launch and the servers for online drop randomly causing you to wait another 5 15 minutes. It's a cool game but it's still garbage.Piece of loading screen simulator. 2/3 of my playtime is sitting in a loading screen.
0;The pros Character customization is okaygame controls are semi intuitive and not terriblegraphics are decentGame area is expansive and you never run out of things to exploreThe cons The other people in GTA onlineInability to actually do missions with friends (come on EA it's not that hard...)unskippable cutscenesunskippable (except before starting) tutorialso many more...I defintely would recommend spending your money on something better...
0;This game is absolute bull**** for online most of these hours i have played are fully online hours i have spent $5 on ps4 after i upgraded from xbx360 then i went to pc and got banned for 30 days no info on why no reason i should and also rockstar claim that 3rd party apps dont get you banned but right after i got msi afterburner either rock* ****ed up or the 3rd party killed my character there goes a load of dedication down the drain.
0;in between real money that youve earned in the game being wiped (i had $500 000 rockstar you really think im a hacker?) and rockstars horrendus robotic support system that doesnt help anyone i can say im never Buying another game from them not a single person in that company deserves your hard earned money
0;Edit 14/06/2017 Take Two have banned modding completely the only reason this game still has any true life in it what a disgrace. The franchise has just become a cash grab at this point they dont care about the players who play it.If you want to truly enjoy multiplayer I hope you keep an extra 100 200 euro for Sharkcards because they price everything ingame so you will eventually need more money.
0;This game Includes a lot of hacker and rockstar doing nothing about it and servers of the game not working well and the real cancer part is kids with tanks on the streets I hope dat silly vehicles gettin removed doesnt worth the price wait for the sale.
0;The fact that they ban hackers from gta v online despite the fact that I tried to get money from thier overpriced shark cars is bull. If you buy this game dont think you can experiment in gta online and get away with it. Rockstar treats you like a slave. Good game though would recomend it otherwise
0;One of the worst games I have ever played. Rockstar has ruined the Grand Theft Auto series. This game has become a pay to win online wreck. I will never buy another Rockstar game. The support is useless updates ruin game play and the online system is useless. Wait times between loading screens can take forever. Do not buy this game. Find a game where the devs care and you can use the game without needing mods.
0;The single player is boring and they release no DLC for it so people go over to the multiplayer. The problem is that the online multiplayer is a constant and unending gring unless you purchase shark cards (micro transactions). The worst thing though is how Rockstar took down the biggest single player mod disabling the ability to get a better single player experience. Don't buy this game (or any of their other games) Rockstar games and Take Two.
0;Modding is part of every franchise some people are attracted to a game depending on what the modding potiental is. If you remove modding that same number of people wont be buying your games again. I liked the game but i wont let companies get away with anything.
0;I THINK IT'S A GOOD GAME BUT SOMEHOW THE DEVELOPER AS BAD AS S**** I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON AND I LOST MY ACCOUNT AND THE MOST EXPENSIVE MOTORCYCLE SHOTARO AND WHEN I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS MATTER TO ROCKSTAR I DON'T GET ANY SOLUTIONS I HATE U ROCKSTAR!!!!!!!! RATING 9999999999999999999999999999/10
0;This game is great I love it I pour tens of hours every week into it.BUT it's still rich of hackers even after 2 years of release T2 hadn't done anything except banning innocent singleplayer mods which did nothing but make legit players boycott the game and overall increasing the hacker population.
0;So I cannot play this game anymore (as it seems).... Now If I wish to play this game I have to allow them to use a Spyware (RedShell) in my PC. As I cannot log in the Social Club without Agreeing on unacceptable privacy policy I effectevly had lost ability to actualy play the game which I had bought for F**KING 60 !!!! ($80)
0;"""Every day i get at least two crashes to desktop because of the age old """"gfx d3d init fix"""". It has been reported thousands of times and this bug appears on all PC's regardless of hardware configuration. Until this is fixed the game is a pain in the and kills the fun outright when the crash occurs on a critical hard earned and waited mission."""
0;Singleplayer modding one of the biggest PC selling points just got destroyed by a legal team that knows they're wrong but that their victims won't fight back. Actual hacking is rampant the shark card system is a joke and it's just an awful unrewarding grindfest. Don't support Take Two. Get the game on sale when they eventually (read soon) kill their online community and stop supporting it altogether.
0;"""BAD BAD BAD!Rockstar is crap and don't care about you. I was banned TWICE for no reason whatsoever. I now have to wait 3 MONTHS before I can play again and I probably will get banned AGAIN! Rockstar's support is lazy and will tell you """"You got banned? OH WELL! We are too lazy to even look at your system files and we will just ban you if some 10 yr old reports you because your better at the game than him."""" Its BullS**t. DO NOT BUY!"""
0;This game sucks. It has alot of loading screens and each of them costs me nearly 20 hours ! For all of you that realize that you only have a low speed internet I harshly recommend you not to purchase this all loading screen game unless Rockstar did some improvements regarding to this fatal irritating errors !
0;Online mode is pretty fuc*ed up disconnecting from sessions every 10 minutes loading screens for 15minutes and random disconnecting every 30minutes + a lot of connecting issues. For 8 hours of playing this game i had 6 hours of loading screen. Congratulations rockstar you dont even answer tickets. Atleast single player is pretty good.
0;Games like GTA5 are like blanc canvasses.They allow for soo much enjoyable mods and beautifull community created contend such as the LCPDFR and OIV.Too bad dev' has killed modding...Too bad dev' has killed their game...https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;""". This. Game. Modders are everywhere online griefing you and you can't do jack about it. The community is just as much of a problem as R*. They take away single player mods yet multiplayer mods are ing rampant.Why the do people enjoy modding so much? If you do itto get extra missions or cars fine whatever. But don't ing mod the lobby so random people """"bomb"""" other people."""
0;"""The story isnt bad but the online portion of this game is god awful. Everybody there is mindless and eventually made me quit online mode. Also if you're thinking about getting mods for this beware. I had two TWO MODS! And the game said """"NOPE"""" and instantly crashed. I cant even get back on the game. everytime i click on the game it tells me that the mods are keeping it from running. Ive done everything in my power to get rid of the mods but it just doesnt work."""
0;I know (maybe) i didn't played this game enough and saw all of it's aspects but Since Take Two banned modding and mods in general i was very disgusted about what they did to the game. All Take Two wants is people to play GTA O and pay for the stupid shark cards that are overpriced for what they offer (Just my opinion for pricing the shark thing just like or more like a game).But now i see mods came back to the game but still they should me ashamed for the thing they done.
0;I just got banned because a hacker teleported my randomly in the lobby. Of course that hacker is still not banned but I am.I hate the Rockstar banning system. If you want to play singleplayer it really is worth it but Gta Online is full of hackers and stupid banning system. After 450 hours of playing my progress wil be deleted.
0;The off line/story portion of the game seems ok but the online element is ruined by certain elements (that are a relative minority but not an insignificant one) of the GTA Online community.It could be an excellent on line game but until R* deal more effectively with the disruptive elements (griefers/modders) I will be unable to recommend this game to anyone.
0;On the surface this game is a great easy to get into online multiplayer mmo thingy but deep below the surface its a poorly thought out piece of trash that makes me want to kick a baby. this game and its hacking players. BAN THE ING HACKERS AND FIX THIS ROCKSTAR ITS STARTING TO BE UNPLAYABLE
0;Had game for years! (ps3) great single player experience ) ..... Online not so much. I'm still unsure why I got perma banned? customer services said I cheated!!??? time to uninstall because even though I know I never cheated I played single player to death. edit Just read some comment's and learned it might of been because I had DISCORD running .....WTF????
0;Gta V in itself is a good game.Gta online is a massive cluster of microtransactions.And the publisher 2K went and made MODDING IT ILLEGAL.The most? important modding tool of this gigantic game with incredible amounts of mods is OpenIV.2K went and shut OpenIV down. them.The only reason my gametime is this much is mods.
0;Rockstar sucks Single Player with mods 10/10 Endless possibilities but no single player DLC anymore... Single Player without mods 8/10 After the second playthrough it gets boring without mods and no single player DLC anymore... GTA Online 3/10 Nope Sharkcards ( )10/10 Still way too much for way too little Overall Score 11/40 Save your money and buy something else
0;"""BAD IDEA!!!!! DON'T BUY!!!!!Played 170 hrs have enjoyed this game from release. However I wouldn't buy this game rockstar have become money driven!!!!. Account has be wiped twice (not my fault) lost eveything right before the last 2 large updates. They then expect you to spend a fortune on shark cards to afford anything in the new update.Rockstar has ruined a perfectly """"good"""" game with the dependance on micro transaction."""
0;The worst server support in any online game I have ever played and Rockstar has been consistently unhelpful and even deceptive regarding story DLC. I think GTA 5 should be seen as a cautionary tale for those companies who would attempt to make a multi player experience out of an essentially single player game.
0;I got banned today i was in a match with a modder/cheater a few days ago and he apparently modded some money into mine and my brothers accounts specifically to get us in trouble and now we are both banned we had nothing to do with it and we now have to buy game again to risk that happening again f% k rockstar!
0;Well in single player mode its fine. But be warned. Multiplayer is a shoot on sight melee. While that may see fun its highly irritating when you respawn next to the that shot you/ran you down/blew you up. Usually they are much better armed than you as well. It is extremely frustrating and makes me not want to play this steaming pile of .
0;I loved this game but TakeTwo just ruined everything by basically dissallowing mods meaning that you can only play their game like they want you to. Sure that sounds fine and dandy but modding is what keeps a game alive for years and gives fond memories. The online is a micro transaction hell that TakeTwo really wants you to play so you can give more money when it takes 20 hours to get a high end car. Dislike from me because of the horrible business practices.
0;Well Take Two has officially ruined the only reason I still play this game. Time to send it into retirement thanks for ruining the fun guys cause free mods to enjoy in single player are obviously gonna destroy the ing company y'know even though most people bought the game twice. RIP GTA V
0;This game was good on the xbox got 96 hours in and then for some reason I can't access social to validate my game (all of which has already been done). I've been searching forums and discussions for a while now and still can't play it even offline. Will be requesting a refund soon once i tire of searching for a fix.
0;This game is just OK now. It was great until rockstar started their complete war on modding. GTA V Online is the only reason to play this game and they slowly started making that more like an MMO in the aspect of grinding. There is so much grinding to do anything in this game now that I dont understand how anyone could ever have the time to play it 100% legit. Its almost as if they responded to people hacking by giving them more insentive to hack it.
0;"""Take two and R* both are terrible companies that want to kill modding. If no one buys the shark cards then just make the DLC payware for a small fee and let people do whatever they want both online and SP. At first banning and legally pursuing modders now restricting modders and their ability to create mods because it """"may"""" violate R*'s IP. Don't buy or play this gane if you want to make a point."""
0;Pros Great visuals Great game mechanics Extremely detailed enviroment Cons Laggy Main Menu Extremely laggy Pause Menu (Also the only way to see the full map) Average waiting time for Social Club to log in 1 Minute (Longest time I've waited was 10 Minutes) Can't change your characters personal car (As far as I know) Overall great game but the cons make it so difficult to enjoy the game.System i5 7600 GTX 1050 Ti 8 GB RamGraphic settings on High with MSAA turned off.
0;Thanks for making this game even less enjoyable by telling me to not mod in a singleplayer game mod. Thanks for making me pay for every in this game but if I want flying sharks and ultra grafiks yall policing me. Back to not buying your stuff then. Rockstar you wasted yourself.
0;Most new content by Rockstar in GTA Online is aimed at people spending big money on their Gameshark cards to get extra ingame cash. These cards are way overpriced.If you are able to only play 1 2 hours a day dont bother playing this. Mod that give you money might help you out and experience that game in the fullest way as it should be but this gets you banned unfortunatly.
0;I really really want to say this is a good game however its become almost unplayable due to the amount of hackers online. You join a lobby and everyone is begging for free money then a hakcer kills everyone 10 times. Until rockstar does something about this dont bother unless your playing for the single player
0;Ehh the Game is OK. There are a couple of major problems. one of the problems is that some of the textures will refuse to load and everything looks like it's floating. Rockstar said they have fixed it but they havent it's still a major problem. Also the online community is worse than leagues and there are so many hackers on there its un real. GG rockstar u did us proud
0;The game for itself is an AWESOME game. But I just requested the refund because in the pc version of this game there are TONS of hackers that's kind of rockstar fault for not giving a permanent ban to them... the 1st ban is a 2 week 2nd is a 1 month and only the 3rd is permanent...
0;Avoid this game at all costs unless you liked to get hacked while Rockstar turns a blind eye. You CANNOT find a public server free of hackers. It's a real shame. Single player is fun but it only takes 20 hours or so to finish. After that you are at the mercy of the script kiddies that basically take over pubs and ruin the expereince for all. Rockstar has permanently lost a customer.
0;This is my game experiece creat a character join a session quitting gta v and online buying shark card return to online buying a car (amored kuruma) going to customization this car get banned for no reason This rockstargames service not gonna help you if u are no modding Don buy this game guys you will get banned anytime for just buying shark card.
0;As fun as the multiplayer is it is ridden with hackers because rockstar games hates PC and is too cheap to use any anti cheat software. Thank you Rockstar for screwing PC gamers again. You'll probably blame all PC gamers for the hackers and never release Red Dead 2 for PC because you are afraid of spending money.
0;havent played GTA5 in about a week and get an email today saying that my account is supended for 30 days and my online progress is reset. I have about 160 hours on GTA and most of it is online my character was level 94 and I had a few nice cars I was a CEO and MC Pres. and only had 3.5M. WTF Rockstar this is t.
0;Permanently banned from Online after I was blown up repeatedly and had 24 million dollars spawned on top of me by hackers. Completely ignored support tickets (Rockstar not steam) and was forced to charge Rockstar the purchase price through my bank as I was outside of the Steam return window.Fraud of the worst kind.
0;this is really dissapointing. the modding is what drew me away from xbox and onto PC. It shouldn't be the publisher's choice to disable mods. We bought the product and we should be free to do whatever we want to it. As a player who's been with GTA since Vice City I say you T2 for ruining a once great franchise.
0;hi i got the game on friday i have a gtx 980 and an amd fx 8320 overclocked 4000mhz so i boot up the game loading screan is fine 64fps i clicked on solo. The game loaded up fine but as soon as the first cut scene stated the fps went to 270 fps and then to 1 fps and stade at that untill i ctrl alt del out of the game even in the pause menu the fps is at 1 i am realy frustrated seen as my friend has a 970 and runs the game at solid 60 fps (
0;DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR THE MULTI PLAYER!!!!!! I got perma banned becuse I off a modder and he started blowing other players up and it said it was me so I contacted support and they gave me a link to the eula and told me to off. This game is not worth 60 bucks if you really want gta 5 DO NOT get it on Steam or Rockstar becuse if this happens to you will not get for support.
0;Loved the game before rockstar attacked modding. Now it looks like they are trying to kill the single player modding community to try and force players onto GTA online in order to force microtransactions down our throats. Rockstar has just managed to ruin a great game. DO NOT BUY IT IN RIGHT NOW unless you want to to pay microtransactions for online play.
0;Stay away from this game seriously. Once you have payed them you are of no further use to them. Thousands of people with game breaking bugs and or issues that are not getting adressed at all. If you contact support you are simply given automated responses linking you the same help page you read a hundred times before you contacted them.If at some point they actualy get round to fixing this i may be interested in trying to play it again. Until then don't bother the stress is not worth it.
0;Online is broken with hackers that rockstar can't deal with lag long loading screens huge inflation of prices. That's a deal breakerLots of problems would be solved if take two and rockstar would use theier serwers for game no hackers less lag but noooo
0;DO NOT BUY rockstar doesn't do crap about modders in gta online don't feed this fu ckery you join 5 games in a row get constantly blowed up by a modder can't pause the game and go into the online tab to report him each time you die it gets cancelled you can't even exit the game you have to alt f4 this game is nice i would play it but when you try to make money for 1 hour just to get blowed up by some dic bag modder who doesn't like himself yep this off rockstar you can kiss my goodbye
0;Hey well.The hacker strikes again.It was all fun and games until someone made everyone continuously explode on the server preventing you from reaching your phone or the menu to set passive mode.What about escape and reach the game settings you ask ? Well you couldn't either because you kept dying which made the menu disappear each time.Well Done R*. The online experience is just a big pain in the booty.
0;Online is absolute crap the most unfriendly multiplayer experience I've ever had.The single player campaign is ok if your 12 its unoriginal and cliche and some of the main missions have been ripped off of hollywood movies like lethal weapon2 and Heat F***** lazy oh! but it looks pritty F*** you rockstar never buying your games again.
0;Crashes everytime unless you delete your save game an start again this happens in multiplayer as well needing to delete the single player save to get the game to run have reinstalled on 3 different PC's same result BROKEN. 12 months of this still not fixed.
0;Wow I cant believe they got rid of openIV That is such a scammy ing thing to do. Rockstar just did that to try to get people to buy shark cards in online which are total t. $100 USD for a ing in game yacht? Wow that sounds like a deal. Im totally gonna play this game again...... Unbelieveable
0;The game is so buggy i cant even play half the time it either glitches out and i cant see my hud or kicks me out of my own games for no reason. I have to sit in lobbies for hours just to find three people to do a heist. Public lobbies have a hacker in every other server that just spawn kill you.
0;I've been playing this game for years I even bought some shark cards to help support R* when the DLCs came out. R* Took all of my money as part of the latest DLC. Modders came in and dropped money everywhere without anyone asking them to. Now I pay the price. R* You have completely abandoned your audience and you're just trying to go for a money grab.I will nveer buy another R* game ever again.
0;Don't buy this game if you have any intention of modding Take Two recently killed OpenIV effectively taking the whole modding scene with them.Online is a microtransaction laden hell hole which at this point employs free mobile game tactics of locking content behind a timer of course you can pay in game money to skip this timer and of course you can buy said money with real money yes full on mobile game tactics in a 40 release. Take Two.
0;Product received for free. stupid GTA have many hacker and sucker policy banned only i doesn't do any hacker but banned me.the last time i play online mode some used hacker killed all session and for next time i will stop to buying and game from Rock Star
0;I had to change my review...I mean I just had! You probably heard of the new DLC (Gun running) And all you heard is true. I use to love all rockstar games! They are still as good though but Rockstar and Take Two let their custumer down my chaining them to the Sharkcard. Expect years of legitimate grinding before being able to afford anything (I mostly play GTA online). They deserve what is happening to them at the moment!
0;GTA was great fun then Rockstar and Take Two decided that not enough people were buying the Online micro transactions. So.. what happens? Open IV gets shut down. D*ck move devs this isn't okay.I just feel sorry for all the hard working programmers who get sh*t on by their cooperate overlords ) &lt 3
0;HEY LOOK GTA'S ON PC BOYS!!!! TIME FOR MODDING SUPPORT AND FUN!!!! OH WAIT................... Microtransactions up the for shark cards grinding for cash and levels and overall just no fun.... Sorry but no man this game its fun but i will not support it its not worth another GTA.
0;It could be a great game the single player part indeed is but the multiplayer one is the most annying I ever played. The game is full of bugs you die from the most of them if your connection drops while selling products or cargo you just simply LOSE IT ALL. Unfair and ignorant towards it's players. And when finally everything works out well you defenitely become the next victim of a hacker.Stay away from this mess.
0;I am having problems with this game that is making it impossible to play and the support team is not doing anything to help every time i try to contact them they xlose the ticket been having this problem for bout a month and have alrady submitted 15 tickets all were instantly closed and/or never answered then closed
0;This game is very enjoyable... when it finishes loading. I'm not joking 1/3 of the game is a loading screen SSD doesn't help much be prepared to spend at least 4 hours for one sitting because if you only have 30 minutes 10 of them will be in the loading screen.
0;why the ing this game has a hacker?Kindly hire a GM to monitor all the lobby.There one time i shoot a guy with a flipping rocket launcher...guess what...that guys didnt die..where's the logic?Sudenly that guy put a spell on me...everything i touch will blow is.F u rockstar.F U.
0;This game... Its fun and all. But if you going to buy this game to play online... Just no.GTA Online ATM has alot of hackers and script kitties that ruin everything by blowing everyone up wherever you are. God mode you get the idea.After that there are the annoying people who just kills everybody for no reason.Its a awesome game in general But its not fun at all at the PC edition because the hackers / modders have ruined it.
0;"""Unoptimized piece of that will waste all your hardware memory. Large open world where you can do NOTHING. Missions are similiar and boring. Story is about a that betrayed his friends for a silicon . And he is like """"okay guys ill do one more job for you"""" """"okay one more job for you guys"""" """"okay guys this is the last job i do for you"""". Its pretty fun with friends but anything is. Would I recomend this? ofc Never. But if you like eating dog buy it."""
0;At first Gta online was fun now everything is ridicously expensive the purpouse of a game is to entertaint to have fun here you won't find none of that you're nothing unless you mod or you buy shark cards also eveything flies now motocycles cars it took a more childish approach. plz change
0;Single player was fun. I'd recommend the game just for that.However...Online is broken now. It used to be fine with occasional cheaters that were quickly dealt with.But now cheaters are rampant and the only people banned are new players that never cheated.Imagine the longest load screen of your lifethen you're finally in excited to playyou walk outside and get insta killed by a cheaterthen you get permabannedwhich can't be appealed 1/10 customer support0/10 online gameplay8/10 single player
0;Up until recently this game had 5 starts from me. HOWEVER I just found out that I cannot play the game that I bought with my own money unless I am ONLINE. That's right folks if you want to play OFFLINE STORY MODE... you better have an internet connection or you're $60 in the hole. ing joke.
0;Well. quite a bit of money down the drain. I bought it and for some odd reason it says that im linked even though it was a brand new game....quite disgusted / (By the way i did put up a ticket but no one seemed to care or acknowledge that I was pretty much stuck. I gave in the right details and they said that it is all wrong).
0;this game is a legendary game but on online is crappy af there is chinese/korean modders everywhere who will ruin ur exprience i shouldve also listened to the ppl who also said that there r moders so pls rockstar pls remove troll feature and other ppl dont buy this game if ur planing to play only online cz there will tons of modders trolling u!!
0;this game is pretty cool in its ways but the support team is bad at doing their job and their reporting system is straight garbage they would instantly ban someone without thinking about what they done or double checking they just rely on the game code

0;R* as a respected company died after financial success of GTA Online. Now it's EA 2.0 with only bad parts left.No story DLC or decent online DLCs since Heists now no mods? R* have you played GTA4 VC LC GTA3? GTA is all about freedom and fun for us players. Not about paywalls and restrictions.Or is it Take Two who's at fault?No pre orders from EA. No pre orders from Take Two now it seems.
0;"""Even though OpenIV is aparently """"back"""" many mods like Liberty City for GTA V SP have been shut down due to Rock Star / Take Two and will never see the light of day.I recommend to buy this game for SP but don't spend money at all on Multiplayer that is all Rock Star cares about these days."""
0;We have the power to stop Take two greediness how you ask?just stop supporting them don't buy any game that is published by them.leave them rott in their offices while watching their company fall to the ground.they just proved that they don't give a about thier customers us the players.so why should we care about them.sign this to support this revolution https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;While this is a great game and I respect the effort the developers put in the DRM issues that plague this game have ruined it for me. Since I got this game a few weeks ago there have been multiple times where I haven't been allowed to play due to Rockstar Social Club having issues verifying that I bought this game. There is literally no option to play offline as the game checks in every couple of hours. And don't get me started on the price fixing see the other reviews for that.
0;Dull and repetitive unless you like grinding the same thing over and over this games only purpose is to sell shark cards. Bans are happening only because rockstar can't sell shark cards that way. Riddle with modders as well as players who only know how to play by blowing up all your stuff until you leave their session.
0;Great game only issue is that for wahtever reason after uninstalling and reinstalling I get an error code with my social club account. The game is complely unplayable for me. I used to have mods installed but have removed every mod and reinstalled multiple times.... Still the game is Rockstar also refuses to help anyone who has a ticket so good luck with that. 10/10
0;How ing dare you after getting so so much money from sales that you then decide to push your greedy onesided agenda by actively trying to get rid of the modding scene for singleplayer.There is no other reason i can think of that would explain why they are doing this you you greedy bastards Take Two
0;Rockstar games. The game outside doing missions is fun. On missions frustrating. I've had to re do missions because of game crashes. On top of that when I got a new computer all of my missions never got saved in the game Cloud. Big minus on that. Game developers on Rockstar sure like to take a piece of the gamers. My experience is coming out a negative. Despite a great open world enviroment. The Online experience is not for those playing alone.
0;"""y u no like single player mods?Oh and your latest super OP ultra imba grind fest DLC is poor form.What happened to you guys??? You used be kinda cool.Oh right... you make 500 million USD per quarter on Shark Cards (look it up folks). Yeah I get it. """"...root of all evil"""" yadda yadda"""
0;The game was fun in the begining... but then everything became superexpencive you don't get much money from hiest and it takes hours to complete a hiest with random . So if you want the fun cars and stuff you either need to cheat and get banned or buy their stupid sharcards. Rock* are nothing more than some greedy
0;tried modding the singleplayer for a zombie sim and forgot to remove it when some friends wanted to play online. banned me for 1 month and reset my character id done hundreds of missions on. if you like companys that shoot first and ask question never this is the game for you
0;Tries to play for an hour with my bros.Had to go trough the prologue.Created a character game bugged on meRe launch game to be forced to do the tutorial.Haven't played online in an hour while my bros are having fun. 10/10 worst multiplayer experience yetNow i am forced to play through the tutorial since the game crashed and the prompt to deny it wont show up.Been playing for 2 hours and the tutorial still isn't done...

0;Is this some kind of a joke?! Releasing a huge update (lowrider update) ONLY for online mode which crashes every 10 minutes and works like SH**! Single player is way better without stupid loading screens lobbys and 10yo kids wanting to kill you every time.
0;Give me my ing money back you RockStar pigs. I swear to god on my life and my yeezys if I don't get my 90 MILLION DOLLARS back by 2 weeks. I will throw up. If I find another bone in my gta V online expierence I will start modding. Give the people what they want. No anti cheat.
0;Great game but wouldn't recommend unless you want to spend out of your to get anything fun or worthwhile. R* either get you to purchase shark cards which by the way are overpriced in my opinion or they force a grind of missions heists and other good ish paying game modes in game which take way too long to create enough disposable income for the fun content they are adding. Not worth the pucrhase anymore.
0;"""OMG I use to love this game to this bits until 14th June 2017 the day Open iV Died the day Rockstar Said No more """"Ilegal"""" Mods the day the world screwed up and rockstar failed to the majorty of the community screw you Rockstar i hate you microtransaction robbing money scamming company"""
0;Wow rockstar nice moveYou have a anti cheat system dont do anything about itHave Hackers online dont do anythiything about itHave singleplayer mods that cant use online and people have lots of fun do something about it and remove it?I dont understand at all what are we doing now rockstar? THIS GAME
0;I love the game but i reaaaaaaaly don't like rockstar. They are just milking content from this game and making everithing so expenssiv that its almost inpossible to have fun without modding. Atleast alittle bit of modding.And al because they want us to buy shark cards. And the stroy mode is okey ish nothing like the old gta 4 tho.This game is if your not ritch or have the free time as a 4 year old.
0;Game is so full of mods it is damn near impossible to play. I learned a valuable lesson though and that is to NOT buy another rockstar game because they seriously seem to do next to nothing to stop modding. A couple bans here and there but all you have to do is sit in a lobby for 5 minutes to see half the room is in on the action. PASS
0;Game Pros Open World Beautiful graphics In depth character customization Passive mode option (So players cant kill you online) Long intricate storyline (Single Player) Weather System Multiplayer Vehicles (Ground/Air) Purchasable Apartments Day/Night Cycle Mini Games Grouping System Car Customization Game ConsCan't tracksuit and gold chain at the same time.0/10
0;The worst part of the series itself. Terrible storyline. Awful 3 characters idea. Boring online part. The actual city remains the same. CBA to mention other lacks of the game.a few positive words + oK gameplay+ the graphical part is good I wouldn't suggest to get this game rather go for GTA 4 as it's muuuuuuch more interesting and fun.
0;you dont pay 60 dollars to work really hard for money in the online mode and i know because i when the game came out worked the whole week straight to get a adder and after words i realize how much time i wasted on for such little reward and have the on cheated for any enjoyment out of the game even with friends good luck rockstar i will not be buying gta 6
0;Single Player mods are now apparently illegal. Yep. Not the ones that completely ruin online games by making people invincible have infinite money or whatever single player mods are what Take Two deems to be the issue. That is the type of people you will be supporting if you purchase this game. People who are so contemptuous of their customers that they will make moves counterproductive to their own business motives just to spite you.
0;Not going to lie I played this game quite some time by lack of better. But can I recommend it? No with a lack of FUN gameplay apart from heisting with friends no. I can recommend it for the story/single player but for the online part? No please I hate it.
0;BAN for no reason what so ever can't play anymore!Its GTA ... the best game ever and every new GTA is better and better but if you get BAN and cant play anymore even when you pay for game a lot of money no one will solve your problem if you got ban for no reason what so ever or from hacker... you just have to buy a new GTA V and... then again D
0;Do you like to spend $1000 a month playing a video game? Do you have 20+ hours a day to play the same game for months/years on end? if your answer to either question is yes then this is the game for your dumbass! For the rest of the world don t waste your time on this turd!! Way to go tar ruining your name and games with microtransactions.
0;this game is great but there are some pros and cons Proseasy to get money because all the modderslooks amazing in 4k runs good on most systemsprovides hundreds of hours of entertainment Cons The modders can also be holes and reck whole servers the pc community is really toxic the game is full of 12 year oldsyou have a chance of being banned for no reasontake two fcked up moddingbut the cons are to bad to give this game a recommendation so i cant recommend this game in its current state 4/10
0;This game sucks. Story mode was ok gta online is stupid because I had a Pegassi opressor a bunker a mobile operations center 1 million dollar apartment office 800 000 car and it all went away when this jerk off gave me 5 million as a drop and I got banned
0;I thought story mode was great as well as multiplayer but things are too expensive online to keep up without grinding hard in attempt to get people to buy shark cards. There's never been a story mode dlc probably to keep the money train chugging that is online shark cards.
0;I don't recommend this game simply because of online where items are worth countless of hours of grinding or a simple store checkout using your credit card. This game is a pay to win system for the most case. Otherwise you have to wait almost an hour to connect to the GTAV online service and then around another 15 minutes to join your friends if you want to join a private session with them.Not a good game nonetheless. It gets boring after a while.
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;The funny thing is altough a lot of people complain about the modders I've had the most fun with most of them not to mention the amounts of cash that i've received so i could actually enjoy all of the games' content to a certain point. Overall good game with decent content but the $$$ grind is boring and ridiculously tedious.
0;this game. this studio. The story was amazing though. The online part is Hackers can take control over anything and do what every they feel funny. I was in a party not relizing one of the guys was hacking to the end I ended up getting banned with no reason they wont even tell me what they think i did. Terrible customer service. To sum it up i was told to go myself.
0;"""Honestly the story in this game is brilliant but the launcher to the game crashes. When you do eventually fix it and get in the game you have this mass stuttering problem even on high end Pc's. After you fix that you end up enjoying the game up until that stupid stuttering problem comes back soon enough you find yourself up to your neck in downloads and fixes.""""You forget a thousand things everyday make this one of them""""Just buy it on console."""
0;Money Grab. Rockstar is overpricing everything in game in order to get shark card purchases. Would take months to get everything from one dlc and they keep adding more and more. Somewhat pay to win because the items from a new dlc are much better/stronger/more efficient then the previous dlc. It was fun but now is just with all the flying cars and stupid sh*t feels more like a futuristic shooter than GTA.
0;the storymode is boring and honestly doesnt stand up to the stories of todays games if you truly want to play the game go for it but get it on sale and if you want to play online i hope you like grinding because to get a decent amount of money takes longer than reaching max total level in runescape
0;its 1h and 15mins now that im waiting trying to get into gta online... i tried anything... start story mode and chance to online isnt faster! If u wanna play the Story play alone or just fight cops in offline buy the game.. if you wanna play online get gta4. THIS IS A LOADING SCREEN SIMULATOR!proc i7 7700K Grafics GTX 1080Ti RAM 32gb ddr4 samsung m2 SSD
0;The fact that they banned from GTA Online for no absolute reason (actually due to buying a shark card and getting banned after) Rockstar Support has always been unhelpful and don't give you the ability to appeal your bans (even if it wasn't justified). Take Two has been nothing but closed minded in disallowing any type of modifications. Just like how the jailbreaking Apple software was helping market Apple products this is just absolute insane.
0;One of the greatest single player campaings ever but multiplayer is a total mess. Took a break from online for about 2 months and came back to find that all my money was gone about $2 million. The prices for things online have gotten so high that its almost imposible to buy things without buying shark cards. Also the amount of cheaters online make it not worth playing anymore any kind of multiplayer combat re in almost imediate headshots.
0;This game is getting worst and worst. Fixing fun glitches and ruining everyones fun. There is nothing wrong with car launching glitches. Its not ruining the game for everyone. I you watch a video with people doing glitches there not yelling or breaking things they are laughing. Because its fun. Vanoss barely makes gta videos because of these glitches being fixed.
0;"""I have been a fan ofo GATV since its launch but recently online has become uplayable. Every session I've been in over the past few days has been invaded by somebody hacking/moding. I've seen flying cars. All players """"invited"""" to a location at once to be mowed down by a guy standing there waiting. Seruious lag and glitching. And NPC cars and players spawning and despawing right in front of me.I know RD2 is getting all the attentino right now but Rock Star needs to fix this!"""
0;GTA is alot of fun expcept for the fact that rockstar basically created a game designed for microtransactions. Ive put almost 100 hours into the game and im basically no where. you have to constantly buy ingame currency for the game to be fun. Some of the mission are also designed just to you off to try and get you to buy more ingame currency. The mission will be far too hard for what you are able to do resulting in immense frustration. this game to its core and you rockstar for being so lame.
0;This game is essentially just a money printing machine. Worse and worse additions in the game such as cars end up costing more and more for each addition. I can't recommend supporting it with your purchase but in all honesty the game itself is alright.
0;Can't believe Take Two reached this decision the greed is just pathetic. Clearly this is the way they have done business for a while and I have no plans of buying their products in the future. Companies like this never change they just never do. There's plenty of other great games out there to play made by people that aren't bigots and published/produced by companies that aren't a bunch of bigots.
0;"""""""You spoke and we listened! We are proud to have such a dedicated fanbase that cares about our game. Modding will be returning to GTA V in Q3 you are now able to use your bullshark cash cards to purchase an impressive array of mods in game making the process easier than ever!"""""""
0;I'm bored of this game!Please Add Good Content and no overpriced items/cars! The community would make more heists! No fun. 60 /60$ Why this big price? Real cost is Max 10 /10$ Why this game is not free to play? For community Use cheats better fun on server. I recommending this cheats https // maverickcheats .eu/ Nice cheats. for your own risk! I received a ban because I wanted to improve my gaming experience.2/10first point Graphicssecond point You can download cheats for your own risk!
0;Online is filled with cheaters hackers and various kind of modding little kiddies who ruin the online experience for everyone who is playing fairly. R* isnt taking any sort of action against these trashes of community so I dont recommend going online until its mod free. DONT BUY THIS GAME TILL ONLINE SITUATION IS FIXED!
0;I have played the GTA V story multiple times on all platforms and it is nothing but fantastic. If you want a great GTA singleplayer experience just buy it already if you haven't by now. Do it. If you want any sort of multiplayer though do not bother with GTA online as it's boring and 99% pure grinding to get anywhere at all. The negative rating is on behalf of the unacceptable multiplayer experience and lack of Singleplayer DLC TLDR Singleplayer fantastic Multiplayer utter garbage
0;If you like modding griefing other players that are trying to grind to level up and earn money the honest way paid for a level 8000 account rank and hacking the game that the developers do not give a damn about even trying to get rid of hackers/ modders etc to make it fair for the actual players. Then this is the game for you!!
0;Broken game broken support im not gonna play this game anymoreuntil they fix several issues related to online modding (serious issues that they dont give a damn) im not gonna support this companyoh also they like to keep legit players banned good job R*here have my negative review2/10and no this is not an april fool it's happening for real
0;don't buy this game. online mode sucks. idk the dev do on purpose or not the connection is bad like VERY BAD. especially when doin Heist. it just feel like they do it on purpose so the player can lost patient and buy the in game money.so far this is game with the most bad connection i've ever played
0;Bad review maybe we are also on the way to the account number! R star will not pay attention to correct this problem really is doomed the player is the core of the game! You go to the player to ignore regard the account as a kind of moneymaking method really is inferior!
0;Game is broken. The amount of bugs and manual fixes required to play 15 mins just to have it crash when system specs are 16GB ram 750 HDD and 250 SSD with a NVIDIA 780 are just dumb... Expected better after waiting 1.5 years for a game to come out on this platform.
0;"""Loading Simulator. Because you will load a lot to begin then find a game then someone will quit then fail the mission for good then load back into free mode then load another mission again.Oh yea still with hackers everywhere but now they call themselves """"modders""""."""
0;The only reason why I bought this game is now been disabled. The owners of this game disabled all singleplayer mods. There is no reason to play this game anymore. GTA online is a hackers haven and it looks like they only want to fix hacks when there new DLC out. GG. I will not buy any more rockstar games or shark cards until they start to support the community.
0;Hey 4 years veteran here. I've bought the game in PS3 PS4 and PC. The singleplayer is fun and totally worth it if you're wondering. But I wouldn't recommend you to play the MP. The MP used to be a fun game until Rockstar made it extremely hard for players who don't want to buy shark cards. Go look it up on Youtube search for Gypsy or Broughy1322. They'll explain it to you.Cheers.
0;ive played gta in the past not my own copy.i found that gta is more fun playing it on your friends ps3 at their houseMultiplayer crashes a lot it got pretty damm dull pretty dam fastwould not recomend for NEW players depends if you played other gtas3/10 would no reccomend
0;waiting to get ban or stripped all money out of my character after a cheater thrown 100k at me while my character was watching TV at my own apartment. Game sessions are littered with these cheater.Don't even call them modder they never do anything good like modders.UPDATE today I logged into GTA Online and discovered that all of my cars have gone without any traces how the could that happen?
0;Singleplayer is nice but... Multiplayer is bad... very badIf you on 1 st lvl meet the 100+ wait death...If you see the ing kuruma wait death...If you death wait death again...You can run and shot without spray(And on sniper rifles)And for this you give 59.99$This is the multiplayer of GTA V
0;GTA 5 Online has no solo player missions it's all bait so you can buy sharkcards. They know that random players &amp trolls will join a mission to fail or leave also the freeroam public missions are just a way for lvl 500 to attack a lvl 35 &amp most of those missions can't be done in invite only rooms. GTA 6 Sharkcard comming to you in 2025.
0;"""This game WAS the greatest multiplayer sandbox game in existance (besides gmod) now everyone online is cheating. Every server I join someone is dropping money or killing someone. Their is so such thing as anti cheat systems in this game anymore. Also. They have designed every add on to the game for you to have to buy shark cards or spend as many hours as me. OR you can just go to Good ol Google type in """"GTA 5 online undetectable scripts"""" and you are good to go. R* don't do this to RedDead2."""
0;Honestly trash game Rockstar a multi millionair company lets their game be ruled by modders and hackers. They do not have an anti cheat instead they look into reports themselves. If you want to get kicked from games and killed by try hards have fun. The only fun I can find in this game is playing in lobbies with friends only. Rockstar is a perfect example of a company that doesnt care about the consumers but focusses more on revenue.
0;Well you did it Take2 you made gta 5 even worse and now I can probably say that you're the worst gaming publisher ever.What you're doing is down right scummy and should be illegal not the other way around. Hope to god this was one prick you are super greedy and he gets kicked or you all are idiots and s
0;A brilliant game ruined by terrible anti consumer business practices. The entire reason for purchasing the PC version was for mods but since Take Two weren't satisfied with quadruple dipping people for mone (original versions PS4/XBO versions PC version and GTAO micro transactions) those've been crippled.I realise the futility of posting a negative review on something I've already paid for twice but hey hopefully it messes with the overall metascore or something.
0;This game is just bad. The game is full of modders / cheaters and you can't even leave your garage without getting shot in the head by a .50 cal Sniper Rifle. Graphics wise the game looks great the vehicle handling is nice but that doesn't make me to recommend you this game. I'd recommend you to wait for a SALE and just buy the game if you want to have fun with your friends in a private session.
0;no taxi bus or trucking missions longs loading time (long like garden hose) very little/no enterable buildings ( we are in 2017 man come on !! ) hackers very little map very little online activities no beards online( i mean big hobos beards) no metal or homeless longhairi bought this game to play a redneck but i could notthank you rockstar... i mean you !!
0;1. Can't play in offline mode STUPID Social Club Crap! 2. If you mod and play offline but since the last update 1.29 BEWARE. Rockstar will ban you even in single player mode because you can not play offline.3. I paid full price for this I should do what I want on my own PC! I love single player mode that's why I purchased this game.4. I WANT MY MONEY BACK ROCKSTAR! Great game but no love for the PC port. Modding brings new life to this game and they blew that up with a rocket launcher!
0;This game was great until i got banned for nothing. Me and my mates have been doing heists for the past week until today when i get home to find i have been banned and my characters going to be reset. After checking the rules i have done nothing wrong and now the game is runied their banning system is broken. Not worth buying as it will ban you eventurly.
0;Rockstar are fun police. Don't buy this game. I got permenantly banned for receiving modded money.Arguably modding money into this game is the only way to actually enjoy it with how overpriced the items are and how little money you receive for doing anything. Will no longer be purchasing Rockstar games.
0;controlls are a pain moneys outragiously hard to make unless you have a few friends that play with you with they would set it up with FPS contolls first the driving then flight. plus theres to many hackers anymore due to rockstar making it hard to earn cash wich ruins the game for everyone. i did love this game when it first came out now its just been run into the ground
0;Developers mainly focus on creating content online. While this content seems great it also requires A LOT of play time to take part in these activities (they often require lots of ingame currency to even get started). Take2 recently crippled offline modding which makes singleplayer gaming very one dimensioned.
0;got banned for ''abusing game mechanics'' what does that even mean? i lagged trough walls and ground cuz it wasnt loading but that was like a week ago when my settings were ed but i didnt ''abuse'' glitches or anything this is just t and even if i was ''abusing game mechanics'' that doesnt mean its my fault its your game so you should fix it not just ban poeple who do the glitch that you made idiots this this game and rockstar
0;It banned me because I was hacking because I NEEDED MONEY... I think they should change 1$ IRL $1 million ingame. Thats Fair not 3$ for $100 000 of which you can just get in like half a second hacking. Its sad. Change the game and ill change it to a recommentation. lol
0;NEW REVIEW FOR THE NEW YEAR Updated 8/22/2017This game is still basically a cash grab but otherwise fun in singleplayer/modding.You want my honest opinion? It's 2017. Find something everyone else is playing probably more fun than this expensive piece. Thanks for reading!
0;They have recently cease and desist to a 2nd hand modding community called openIV this tool only effects the singleplayer and does not touch the multiplayer but they are essentially trying to make single player mods illegal. Shame on you Rockstar Games and TakeTwo Interactive.
0;First off i came to pc from xbox about a year ago my specs i57300hq gtx 1050 4gb so i picked up gtav and it runs awful 20 or so frames and would constantly frop to 5 frames meanwhile other peopl would get 55 60 fps with same specs/laptop. not sure what to do. so i would not get it unless you're sure it will run.

0;Who the do you think you are Take two?? It's US the people who play they game and feed you money and you treat as like this?

0;Requires internet connection to play single player in offline mode. YOU LITERALLY CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT THE INTERNET. Complete t. I've been a long time fan of rockstar and they have now permanently lost a customer for all future titles. Get ed tar
0;A game that has such a vibrant creative modding scene has had it's money hungry publisher issue a Cease &amp Desist to the main modding platform (OpenIV) because they don't want people playing ANY part of their game that isn't the microtransaction laden grindfest that is GTA Online.Wouldn't recommend buying/playing this game anymore. Modding one of the holy grails of PC Gaming has been declared illegal by Take Two and it's wrong. Awful awful publisher.
0;It is a great multiplayer online game If you want to play peacefully with your friends then I can't recommend this. See lots of annoying bug exploits/cheater. Big advice dont ever and never take money glitch or RR will banned you even you're not the one use that glitch.
0;R* keeps adding content to GTA ONLINE only You need mods if you want to get some of the new weapons cars etc. to work in single player. They do this so they can milk the the outta the onlike kiddos with that Shark Card moneygrabbing thing.Sadly it looks like GTA will be the new milking franchise ditching the single mode to cater to the 12 year old online fanbase.
0;If you don't have what to do with your life and your free time buy it. 10/10 time sink investmentReview updated gave it a try today 17th of March 2018 and yes its still a CRAP game full with bugs glitches hackers hackers a fckin ton of hackers Glad i havent spent a dime on their sharkcards and i hope take two will bankrupt and burn in HELL HAHAHAHA D
0;this game is riddled with 8 14 year olds using mod menus that give them the ability to kill anyone they want and to not be able to be killed. Its full of immature kids that will throw around the stereotypical did your mom jokes and then will proceed to take all your hard earned in game items. This is a trash game now and you shouldn't waste your money on it.
0;Product received for free. the game is fine little short but i hate take two becasuse they treated pc users like scumbags not realising any red dead redemption game and blocking MODS that to them really dont do any harm online sucks never play only once.

0;This game is total shit. pure grade A for so many reasons. they dont give a about removing modders. because by the day i see more modders everytime i go on gta i get killed by a modder THATS A FACT. almost every session i go in with more than 10 players there is most likely a modder there. dont get this game fk rockstar. remove the modders its been way to long.
0;such game with ing chinese cheater they put so many airplanes on my head boom people i have been reported so ing times and they still alive why dont you create a session for these people why dont you create vote kick if you cannot defend the cheater pls make something help player dont angry when meet them
0;Sweet christ Take Two you've gone and done it now haven't you..I honestly have no idea why you'd remove mods from a single player game let alone mods that are ONLY playable on the singleplayer game. Is it because you plan on selling multiplayer excuslive vehicles and content to people who play the singleplayer hence why they can no longer mod them in? Nah they'd never do that. Probably.
0;Crashes persistently do not purchase. Do yourself a favour and walk away from this. Rockstar is anyway phasing out support for GTA5 you can test this by putting in a support request and watch it deflected by the same fellow (or machine) every time.Coming from a former die hard fan of the GTA franchise since GTA3 walk away and keep your memories of GTA intact.
0;I was looking for a game that was getting ier with every new update and stumbled upon this. Also this game has THE ABSOLUTE WORST anticheat in the history of mankind. Like seriusly if someone on the server you're on hacks you might get banned.Perfect game. Perfekt score.5/7 would get banned again.
0;F*ck Rockstar. They banned me a while ago and I only discovered recently that they had. Upon further inspection I discovered that I was banned for an offence that I wasn't even in the lobby for.Rockstar support is a joke so I'm glad that I'm not spending a penny on RDR2.
0;"""congratulations Take Two and Rockstar you just managed to turn the biggest part of your pc community and especially the modding community against you.you got some great company though with EA Ubisoft and the newest member Bethesda&amp Zenimax.so on top of basically banning modding with your cease&amp desist letter towards the openIV team you deliver the most horrible PvP oriented DLC for gta online yet with the """"gunrunning"""" BS.way to go really..."""
0;Dissapointed over the years i played Gta v Do rockstar care about players no. What do they update more and more expensive things. This is the reason why people hack your game. And what u left a bot to ban us?. Even innocent people. 8 million for 124 dollars?. What can u buy witch 8 million much + 124 dollar can buy alot of things Foods cakes and others stuff. I never want to play this game again.
0;If you love Battlefront 2 levels of grinding and microtransaction slow loading times encountering modders on a regular basis and waiting for your contacts to pick up the phone (insurance mechanic) who have nothing else to do as they are not even real players then this is the game for you. I do not understand the high review ratings at all. Also worst loading times ever. 5 to 10 minutes for just loading into a session.
0;I'm not original when it comes to Take Two evil corporations.Copy and Paste &gt Enter an online session&gt Cheater starts shooting money at you&gt Change session ASAP.&gt Get banned.I'm pretty sure that cheater is still playing normally.Adding to the review.
0;I DO NOT LIKE THIS NO! Isn't it stupid funny how when you drive a car it goes forward? you! ! I was not going to play this man game if I had to drive all the time but I have to! Stop with the going please... why can't I just play the good old days?! me
0;Story mode is good but if you are getting this game for online trust me its not worth it. Everytime you join a session of 10 players 2 or 3 of them will be a cheater sometimes they will use those cheats blatantly. If you get killed by a cheater dont bother trash talking them just join a new session or stop playing online because this game is littered with cheaters.
0;Due To Mods Being Banned I DO NOT Recommend People Buying This. I Have Stopped Playing The Game Now Because Of This Worst Than Infinity Ward Making Infinite Warfare What A Big Mistake Take Two And Rockstar... And Your Baby Shark Cards WON'T SAVE YOU NOW.
0;I got this game on PC because I wanted to mod the single player. It was bad enough that GTA online is nothing more than a cash grab than these greedy s at take 2 decided that modding the single player is now illegal. take 2 rockstar and every one of their future products. Give your money to less greedy s.
0;You like modding? tough luck then thanks to Take Two Interactive the best tool for replacing models sounds sfx or anything in this game will cease to have support (and will eventually die because of the lack of proper updates to keep up with the game's dlcs) Thank you for ruinning an awesome game very considerate eh.
0;Unable to access Rockstar servers. Activation of GTA V requires an Internet connection. Please check your connection and click Retry or click Cancel to quit. Can someone Help ? I tried more and more it still same when I buy this game I download it for 63 GbI had join Rockstar Games Social Club on Website too and Linked all my Social Media. But Still can't play. Please help me
0;Take Two recently gave a Cease and Desist letter to OpenIV a modding site for GTA games. Basically they are claiming modding GTA is essentially illegal. OpenIV complied just to avoid a long legal battle that will go nowhere.I don't even care to mod GTA's Singlepayer (OpenIV doesn't even touch the multiplayer portion to keep their users from being banned) but this is just pure BS.
0;You remember the Hot coffee mod for GTA San Andreas right? It made the sales on that game go FLYING! .. OpenIV Was making the GTA 4 city into GTA 5.. And if it didn't get stopped. The sales for GTA 5 would be FLYING Like GTA San Andreas... Come on man.. You know this..
0;hacker put the bug on mi (bulding top on head) after a year i get ban !!! son of the Rockstar Games i won't support (Rockstar Games) any more it what a scammer company u can't fix the problem u put the ing blame on customer (ban) MEAN FIX IT !!! i should just download cracked Rockstar's game !
0;This is a great game no doubt OK. But this crash at blitz play mission which totally make it impossible to make normal progress in main story.For real? For this money? And they don't even give a patch for this yet?I don't like to put things in this way but I can't help it this time If I were Trevor you are all dead already. You'd better get it fixed soon.
0;I started the game just fine but my friend had a problem about social club telling that it is bugging and that it is loading for 14 hours and it is not installed yet so rockstar is a b!tch releasing the game with a lot of bugs that half of the people cant play the game
0;I CANT GET THE CHANCE TO PLAY AT ALL. The size of the update is just the same of the game. wtf. i just need to play not wasting my time downloading. Just now i finished download and i restarted my pc then when i open up steam it continues back downloading from the beginning. Seriously ? When i get the chance to play?!? Just make the update for the important one. UGH. 4mbps thts my connection speed. it takes 2 days to download (if none of my families were using)
0;So I bought tjhe game and when I open it I have to login to Social Club. The Problem is that the excellent Rockstar Browser built out of Sticks and Crap opens another Ad Page when I click anywhere. It would be okay if you could go one Page back or something but NOOO you cant even have more than one Tab open so you are ed if you have any kind of Browser Add on on your PC cause Rockstar is too lazy too make a ing good Browser or use Chrome or Opera or like that.Don't buy that game
0;Wasted way to much time and effort into this game. They keep added content to the game but wont admit anythings broken. It's been out for numerous years and they still don't fix the little things. It ends up feeling like a chore to play the game. Like you have to play it instead of want. Only good with a couple of friends otherwise you'll keep getting killed alone. Also gameplay is ruIned by a modder joining in your game every hour. Have been playing since it came out.
0;Dude I understand updates big prices for sharkcards ... kinda BUT ING DO SOMETHING WITH THIS GAME IN THE RIGHT WAY NOT BAN MODS AND BE . Banning mods thats how they think they can limit onlinem odders that the game how about make a anti cheat system that works !!
0;Could've save money for Fallout 4 instead...+Good Graphics+Fun to Play with Friends Hackers Even when in Garadges Random deaths from explosions Constantly trying to make me replay prologue Not much to do Online alone not interested in story probably interesting or really dramatic I just dont care to waste my time in THIS game.Its my opinion.16GB ram GTX750Ti SC 3220 i3 processor 3.3Ghz plays great high settings never noticed lag.
0;Product received for free. I am a GTA player from China and thinking the gameplay very well. With good display and sound effects role play and car driving as well. But the most bothering thing now is WHY I CANNOT LOG INTO THE GAME UNLESS I HAVE BOUGHT A VPN?
0;Supporting the modding community. I'll have to give this game a negative review I've played it alot and honestly found enjoyment of installing high end cars ENB's and racing around SP I haven't touched MP in forever given that its just terrible.Bring back modding Boo Take Two.. Boo
0;RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN IF YOU WANT ANY MODS FOR THIS AT ALL BECAUSE TAKE TWO ARE MONEY GRABBING F**KSTICKS AND TAKEN OFF OPENIV SO THEY PUSH EVERYONE TO ONLINE WHERE THEY CAN SHOVE MICRO TRANSACTIONS DOWN YOUR THROAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;"""Not even worth half the price. """"Game of the year 2015"""" hasn't got steam cloud so you can lose your saves just by reinstalling. If u haven't got a NASA PC then u better get one for this game to even run on low graphics with your monitor resolution."""
0;"""Fantastic game but Rockstar's taken the cake from EA for manipulating and scamming its customers.DELAYSMORE DELAYSSUMMER """"SALE""""RAMPANT HACKING IN UNMONITORED ONLINE LOBBIESTo the developers of GTA V please leave this shady company and continue to create wonderful games elsewhere."""
0;Disappointing. Loved single player as I have all versions since the original. Never messed with online. The few mods that I used made playing in single player very enjoyable and relaxing after beating the game. Unfortunatly all of a sudden that is not possible because of the lastest update (which does not add anything to single player). It's a shame really..
0;The Single player is fun to play but I have spent most of my time on the multiplayer. I have been playing in online for over a year now and it has freqently crashed. Its a Triple A game which at the time I paid 40 for. I do not expect it the crash constantly like a Java Programme.Furthermore getting rid of a mod which has been around for 10 years. RIP OpenIV I had allot of dun with you.
0;"""Game is Trash Love GTa all around but if you want the truth you spend more time Loading and waiting then you do playing. Then when you launch a heist after just doing a heist 30 mins ago it closes the mission and says """"failed"""" to connect not enough players but all for are waiting and in TS/Ventrilo/W.E you use lol game staight trash after tehy kept push back the release date"""
0;Probably the worst GTA Series in the worst. Worser than GTA 4. You CANT get a stabil connection to the online servers. Mostly everyones leaves because timeout or something like that. You will get players who can't play killing you everytime in freemode. Doesn't matter but rockstar is giving a about it.Don't waste your money and buy instead The Rise of Tomb Raider better Im out. Worst GTA Game I've seen.
0;While the single player game was phenominal the first time i played it there have been no additions to the single player in anyway. While the online mode was fun with friends for a little bit the gameplay got a little stale with no real direction to go. If they had a littl ebit more content on teh single player instead of the cash grab cheap content of the online then i would recoment it. (also Take 2 sucks)
0;suck my balls thru my drawers take two.also a big middle finger for all the microtransactions in gta online and generally everything about this game that makes it such a step down from gta 4. but specifically sending a cease and desist against openiv is the biggest middle finger to the consumer that you guys could have given. burn in hell.
0;I have been playing for months ..now since a few weeks it refuse to load ofter social club open ending with a black screen...i tried everything that a find on rockstar support to fix the problem but without any result and for what i read on the net i am not alone but one in thousands
0;After playing the game for over a year and having so much fun with my friends I was sad to see the unfortunate decision Rockstar had made to ban all who recieve money from hackers. So if a hacker literally walks up to you and forcibly hands you money you will be banned. Hmm not the fairest game mechanic.
0;Would be a great game if it didn't crash every five minutes. In singleplayer there are roughly 5 missions that will ALWAYS crash your PC almost always at the same spot in the missions. The online isn't much better. It will randomly crash as well. Maybe it is an AMD thing as my friends with Nvidia don't really have this issue. DONT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE AN AMD!!!!!
0;all i can suggest is do not buy this game now wait 6 months the game us currently unplayable for a lot of people there is an issue that comes up for most people where after playing a few minutes the game will have a dramatic frame rate drop and then eventually become unplyable all together no matter what settings Rockstar knows this is happening but they are simply refusing to patch it yet they are focusing on the stupid windows installer thing when this issue is bigger in my opinon
0;extremly annoyed that i need to buy a new copy of the game after being permenantly banned especially considering i wasnt hacking or modding the game in any way when i got banned now i need to pay 40 pounds just so i can play online again. the game itself is absolutly amazing just annoyed that i can change accounts or get unbanned
0;One of Rockstar's lawyer has recently ordered a Cease and Desist letter to OpenIV a very important program for modding.So what the is the point of even buying this for the pc? I seriously don't even comprehend why the hell they would make such a stupid business decision. So this game and Take Two!
0;I want my money back.This game is horribly optimized for pc. That's it. I get an average of 60 fps on my decent computer but the game is just so poorly optimized when you hop into a vehicle and start driving the game lags out an becomes unplayable. Alot of people are having the same issue and there hasn't been a fix for ages. It isn't the computer's fault.It's ridiculous Most of the hours I have in this game is just me messing with the settings trying to make the game run as expected.
0;I kindly request the withdrawal of the cease and desist to OpenIV. I have spent a lot of money to play this game across multiple platforms and shark card gifts for myself and friends. I would seriously reconsider buying another game from them if this is how they wish to treat players of the single player experience.Meanwhile Bethesda is embracing it.Somebody understands good business decisions and someone else does not.
0;1. DONT buy this game2. Rockstar you guys destroy our game experiense 3. WE WANT TO GET MONEY AND NOT GET BAN FROM THE GAME! THIS IS WHY PPL CHEATING THE GAME WE CANT GET MONEY EVERY BODY BUYING EXPENSIVE GAMES TO HAVE FUN AND GET WHAT THEY WANT TO SO PLEASE ROCKSTAR GIVE US WHAT WE WANT TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Ive had this game since it was early access I knew what i was getting into and figured they would eventually fix the game when they fully released it. Well that wasnt the case instead of fixing the optimization and fixing the servers they change the UI a dozen times and add a event pass plus pointless cosmetics. I gave this game countless chances to get better but Bluehole kept letting me down. Way to go guys you really ed the pooch on this one.
0;Biggest Piece of ever! paid for it spend 3 days downloading it as the servers used for preload are just crap and now i cant even play the ing thing. the GTA V launcher crashes every time i try and run it.As i cant even play this game Rockstar needs to GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.
0;The story is fantastic and the game looks unbelievable but the online is a disaster to say the least. Hackers are rampant and one even managed to crash my game while heisting. On top of that with the recent patchs both singleplayer and multiplayer are UNPLAYABLE on my r9 285 gpu. How Rockstar managed to this game up after launch is beyond my realm of comprehension.
0;It has elements of a good game but online gameplay is tedious. Rockstar didn't even have the decency to add gamemode and session browsers. good to play if you have friends to play it with It has a map editor but getting people to join your game is fine if you have all day to wait for them.
0;shitest game ever almoust without normal story line and without mod using posibilities btw nice cars but for that i can play some racing games i guess. This rockstar mfckers creating path updates wich ones screwing every your try to use mods fck ...just threw my money out....
0;"""Always have connection problems. Join a game and it's fine for about a minute until everyone but a few people suddenly """"leaves"""" the server. I have looked into ways to fix this for months and can never find any support for PC users with this problem. I give up."""
0;The game itself is pretty decent however im going to NOT recommend it because of the Pay2Win aspects (Shark Cards) the constant stream of modders and cheaters destroying the online portion and the constant negligence of the single player portion. But the game is still pretty fun to play with mods offline.
0;Only reason I played the game got removed mods. I refuse to play this game vanilla when rockstar said they would support mods. That combined with the useless and unfun P2W online make this game a hot pile of garbage for long time owners like me. Rockstar needs to get their heads out their asses or I wont touch RDR2 with a 10 dollar pole.
0;I think the reviews are full of GTA 5 is the best MOBA I've ever played. You've got the best intergalactic space travel to boot.You've got some Star Wars some Lord of the Rings even some 2017 Assassin's Creed movie in here somewhere.Who gives a about a fun community function that just got cancelled and was pretty much half the reason for people liking the game? C'mon guys let's face the facts.GTA is a cool game. 11/10
0;Its shiit every lobby there are like 10/15 ppl hacking and killing u with expolions.And than are ppl with rhinos that dont get stars idk why but the game is sooooo goooood (sarcasm).The servers are laggy AF yo...I DONT ADVICE THIS SHIIT EATING MONKEY GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Online Everyone tries to kill you bully you or try to frick up your missions on the session for no fricking reason. If you want to have fun you you cant becouse you are broke af.Give real money which sucks give ton of time to earn money which sucks download a trainer to get money which sucks becouse of danger of virus. This game's online sucks as hell
0;When i shoot someone that someone try to kill me and luckly i got him with shooting at far range and i killed him then what happen? i really don't understand judging me who hacking. Please i like this game so much stop and banish all hackers. I was getting bad fate with that judging me as a heck. (
0;I am having some bugs online when i try to buy any gun online my game crashes .And when i try to park any one of my vehicles in my garage it shows the outside world but im still sitting in my vehicle in the garage and i cant get out i have to find a new session does anybody know how to fix this im new to pc gaming i dont think its my laptop its not nol end or anything
0;This game would highly profit from being functional at all.A lot of fun but also an unholy mess. Maybe it would be wiser to not let the rockstar attitude be part of the sourcecode.Online is especially bad. Barely playable since the latest patch. For the price and the fact that it's more than a year old you should be able to expect some stability and not having to spend most of the time it is actually running waiting for it to load.
0;DONT BUY THIS GAME IS ING FULL OF BUGS NOTHING ELSE I BOUGHT IT AND PLAY A HEIST i made it 90 procent and was on the plane to the laning zone and i would make it with my friend then it ING CRASHED in the end i just say u have ing delay this 2 4 times and u cant ing fix a crash bug on like 9 months im ing dissapointed. just wish i could get my money back
0;For laptop player don't buy the game until they fix the issues!! always have to disable my dedicated graphic card for access the game then enable it back and where is my pre order bonus? until now the game has been play few missions i still can't claim the bonus. Always crash out from the online mode i can't even running more than twenty minute in the online mode. please fix it!!
0;As of writing this it has been over a day since the launch and I still haven't even gotten to launch the damn game because it is broken and rockstar have done nothing to fix it. Even if the game is the best game ever it will be soured by the abysmal launch it had. 0/10 For gameplay(Unplayable)0/10 For Graphics(Unplayable)0/10 For Characters(Unplayable) 99999999'/10 Rockstar support10/10 My Salty attitude
0;Cant believe the amount of positive reviews for this game. Im not sure whats worse the ing losers who hack and might as well be playing single player or the hoards of players who instead of reporting them beg them for money. Every single lobbdy has at least 1 hacker in it.
0;i would recommend the game for people who give a about the online mode but if you want to play with your friends on GTA Online you have to deal with ALL that cheaters wich ruin the whole Online mode right now and it seems like Rockstar just dont give a .2/10
0;GTA V Singleplayer is great. Not to much depth tho.GTA V Multiplayer is an abomoination 70% of the time you are waiting for lobbys to fill loading screens to end etc. etc. etc.I feel like this game couldve been alot better if the money for this joke of a multiplayer went into the singleplayer.60 /$ not so much. Surely a great game for 40ish /$.For now i dont recommend this game lets see how the muliplayer comes along.
0;"""For a game that has been delay 5 months and released 18 months from the initial release having any bugs is utterly unaceptable. Upon launching my game the social club launcher crashes with no error codes. I've tried every """"fix"""" that rockstar and fans have put out but all to no avail. When this game did initially work for 3 hours I must admit that it was a fantastic port."""
0;This game is garbage at this time. Spend $60 and can't play it because rockstar doesn't understand switchable graphics. Controls are not very well done. I'm going to have to spend hours troubleshooting this POS just to get to work. Save your money. Wait until it goes on sale and the bugs are fixed.
0;"""A big reason why I even bought the game on pc was for mods. You know what Rockstar said to that """" YOU"""". You know I spent my time in GTA already back on the 360 waiting for heists since online launched. I can say that it was probably the longest and worst wait ever. It's too bad I got baited into buying this game for all the cool mods just for Rockstar to all over me. 8/8 rockstar perfect buisiness practices you can almost feel the lack of given to the pc community"""
0;good game fun online but the new policies rockstar has put out that bans people form installing mods EVEN if it's only single player is absurd. If you have a xb1 or ps4 i recommend getting it for those consoles. the very thing that gives pc ports value and increase life of a game is mods. If valve makes a new system for paid mods agian and rockstar starts changes it's policies to allow mods again we are going to riot and im getting a god damed refund.
0;PC Ulitmate experience my .. Buy preorder download files before premiere. Wait 30 min for decoding files on launch. And then what? You cannot play because R* don't know that some countires use more letters than basic 26. I bought this game paid for it and still I can't play it. On this position for me it's a scam.
0;DO MOT BUY DO NOT BUY YOU WILL GET BANNED BECAUSE OF OTHER HACKERS.I RECEIVED MODDED MONEY SO THEY BANNED ME WTF? WHAT THE MOTHRFUKING HOW THE AM I RESPONSIBLE AND Y AM I SUPPOSED TO BE BANNED.THEY TAKE U FOR GRANTED.THEY WILL BANN YOU FOR NO REASON.IF YOU ARE NOT FONT OF DONATING THEN STAY AWAY AS U R DONATING MONEY TO R* BUY BUYING THIS
0;I would rate this game positively except for the fact that I got perma banned for doing nothing I do admit to cheating many months ago (mainly to screw around w/ friends in private lobbies) but recently I hopped online and played casually but the next day I get on and now I cant play online... GG Rockstar
0;F*ck Take two en rockstar for making MODDING ILLEGAL DON't download the game if u don't want to spend a additional 150 dollar/euro's to JUST START ONLINE !!!To get everyting online u need to spend over a 1000 dollar/euro's !!!WTF NO DLC's for story mode U ONLY CARE ABOUT F*cking money U already made 3 bilion is't that enough Motherf*ckers
0;Product received for free. This game used to be awsome before R* made modding ''illegal'' i am really unhappy with it. Modders most of the time make the game more fun he gives money spawn stuff and more. R* for **** sake let a bit fun in this game and did i say the overpriced shark cards like the one for 1.25 mil u can buy like a car or i guess buy a bunker and its 15 bucks. Plz make GTAO great again.
0;Despite my thumbs down rating this game is fantastic.I only give it a negative review because of their frankly dirty business tactics and forcing of users to pay microtransactions just to play online without being a poor loser. Over half the games content is locked behind money doors you can't properly afford without forking over over 100 USD of real cash.
0;"""my set up gtx 960asus x99 pro32GB ddr4 ramSan Disk 480GB SSDIntel i7 5820K 3.30 GhzWith this kinda set up i would think my computer should be able to handle the game. buutttt NO i join multiplayer and 15 mins into the session i crash with the wonderful """"gta v stopped working"""" window.10/10"""
0;Rockstar used to be a good developer until GTA 4/5. Then they stopped caring about the player experience and became all about the money. Many people STILL can't even get the game to launch and those that can are stuck with singleplayer unless they want to get spawnkilled by a cheater.I'd love to recommend it based on the gameplay but it's ruined by the above facts. Give your money to a developer that actually cares about what the players need.
0;Singleplayer was great Multiplayer let this game down. management of attempting to ban people who hack in online play disrupting harmless modification of singleplayer aspects of the game Rockstar has gone to and Take Two are as usual.Pinacle of Gaming.
0;Did not realise that this garbage still occupied so much space on my hard drive until Rockstart sent me an email saying that I 'm banned for cheaters dropping random cash on my head when I was playing online half a year ago.Thanks Rockstar now I have 70 Gb more free space.
0;Game is extremely buggy. Audio gets choppy randomly visual glitches on certain weather effects and time of day camera randomly gets stuck on last team standing game crashes after a while on a certain pilot school mission. I highly suggest waiting to purchase until they start patching.Edit where my mods
0;Take Two basically killed their own reputation within the community and ruined their public image with this move. Definitely not a wise decision.EDIT Forgot to mention that even though OpenIV has been back for a while there are too many issues I've had with the game offline and online for me to give it a reccomendation anyway. Good game bad management and follow up.
0;People mod because people don't like being robbed for their money devs rip single player content out and place it in multiplayer they release DLC and the DLC content cost 50million and up in game. Of course you cannot have the spirit to grind for this so you look into buying 8million in game cash for 100 real life cash it's criminal. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MP.
0;I'm giving this a bad review even though mods are back it still has a lot to catch up since the ban of OpenIV Another reason is the online is apsolutly horrible because the money you get is literly not enough all you get is maby $500 $1000 on some missons and you hardly that much on races or even the new gunrunning missions
0;Best Developer/Publisher Game ? WTF u kidding me?This game makes me have to use internet even though only play single player. WHY i think ing better to play single player using pirated version cuz pirated version don't need internet to play that.Online DRM is BULLSH!T
0;"""Worst online expirience ever. Loong loading times people lefting sessions Cant even play 1 hour straight without """"lefting session"""". Lot of hackers so you are not even safe in public session anymore Worst support ever False baning people over nothing. GTA ONLINE LOADING SIMULATOR. Game like game is great but online part and its P2P torrent conectivity for such a big game... just no...Edit this review is from 2015 and still same stuff are here... gg Rockstar."""
0;Pay to f***ing win system is BS.Don't get me wrong i love this game but don't expecy being able to grind anything but a knif within your first two too three weeks without paying twenty dollars for an in game million or so. After playing off and on for a year or two i can say the late game is an expencive wast of time.Please rockstar is rich enough don't wast your money.
0;very stupid multiplayer. you have to either pray for a hacker or sell your house in real life to get a virtual vehicle. when you sourced vehicles and had your friend help he would make the money too... now you cant do anything other than heists to actually get money to have fun with the game. paying $60 for the singleplayer is not worth it. rockstar is just a group of greedy pigs that just want money!
0;ing trash this game has been out for so many years and yet this game manages to be riddled with stupid ing glitches as i just spent 2 hours trying to do the first heist when it was time to be air lifted out by eddy in the chopper he simply sat there flying on the spot doing nothing 10/10 ign would nerver buy this game again D
0;Game is plagued by hackers and cheaters and most weapons are very poorly balanced. Further Rockstar has done very little about this and what they have done has been ineffective at best.Also they thought they could try banning mods from the SINGLEPLAYER game. Heh. Reviews went from Mostly Positive to Overwhelmingly Negative seemingly over night.
0;Its a really good game BUT play online banned you dont even have to do anything rong just play and get banned. best part is they dont give you a reason why they banned you. if you send a email they will just send an automated email back saying they cant lift the ban or change it. they dont listen to their fans at all. thanks rockstar games please fix your game.
0;Some monster system is needed if you want to have a smooth skin touching session for the game to feel smoother than your smooties.You gotta drink em up if you want a smooth skin experience like mr smooth man that lives next door to Mr Meseeks and Mrs Smooth Skin.Overall Smooth Sandbox fused with Smooth Prostitues and what do you get?A ROUGH SKIN DAMMIT!!!
0;i spent an extra $20 for some apt and garage and some cars. what a waste. this game is dead im not even gonna play it what a waste of $40 yee hawupdate 1 week later and it doesnt even launch lmfao please dont buy this trashedit 2 imagine spending $20 on 1.25m LOL JUST BUY A MODDED ACCOUNT FROM SE7ENSINS.COM ROCKSTAR GARBAGE GAME DEVS THEY ARE JUST MILKING THIS GAME ITS NOT WORTH TO PLAY LEGIT
0;I am upset. I did not think that a very well patched and funded game such as this would have me doing 2 hours of research just to get past social club issues. I still have not figured out how to get past the loading screen and judging by the views on the help videos on youtube I am not the only one.
0;Great storyline and epic missions vast open world but GTA Online full of cheaters hackers and bullies (yeah you could get ban because those cheaters). If you buy this game for offline mode that's ok. If you buy this game for online mode and you doesn't have any friend oh boy you f*cked ! The server freaking bad !!! The time it takes to join a session you could built another paramid in Egypt.
0;Hackers in every single lobby every SINGLE day. Absolutely destroying the multiplayer experience. They will make it rain $40k bags of cash on your head even if you are in your garage or apartment they instakill anyone online... It sucks.EDIT Im getting tired of having to make a new character every week because I want to earn my own money and not have $5 mill dumped on me. Its getting really old.
0;I would recomend this game but when the removed character transfering it just ed me. Rockstar stopped it because of people moving modded accounts to next gen but they could just stop them modding and fix that instead of getting rid of transfering. I waited 9 hours for this game to download then i couldnt transfer so i wasted my whole day waiting for the game to download.
0;game on ps4 was amazing best game i ever played but this PC is horrible the gun mechanics feel terrible the driving is clunky the controls for flying planes are just awful and the online experience is ruined by people dropping stickies on you every time you try to do a CEo/Smuggler run mission in free mode the game should not be played on PC sadly
0;Serious connection issues.Rockstar has avoided this issue since release blaming who ever and what ever they can to avoid fixing their game.If online multiplayer is a big part of the game for you I wouldn't buy it unless it's 50% off to compensate for 50% of the broken game.
0;cant join my friends game cant invite my friends matter of fact cant even join online this game was better on consals not dis talking PC but rockstar ed up on pc to were my freinds and i cant even join each others games on PC we tryed for 3 weeks now and its still broking i want my 60 bucks back
0;It is is sucks game with noob banning system. This rubbish game will ban you for no reason when u are playing. Their support system will reply you an useless comment. When your account got ban once. You will be banned twice and permanantly. Holy game and system. Please do not play this game dude.
0;This F**** compnay don't care about costumer satisfaction . There is a error called ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT that we reported months ago that makes game crash even on high end pc . There are lots of petitions support tickets forum topics even here on steam and rockstart support forum but they just DONT GIVE A F*** . We Paid for this game and we can't play that's it .https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/communities/public/questions/203458477 ERR GFX D3D INIT Crash BSOD
0;Loading screen Takes forever (minimal 10 15 minutes) even with an i7 processor SSD + GTX960 grafic card.And most worst part is YOU CANNOT TURN OFF/MUTE THE LOADING SCREEN MUSIC. not even when all audio settings are turned off.Its impossible to youtube or do something else without ANOYINGLY GTA5 Loading screen Music on background.Dont get tempted to buy this horrible game.
0;this game. I only had the chance to play it for a couple of days after launch. I crash in the first loading screens I can rarely get to the main menu. I don't get to play GTA V I get to play game crash simulator 2015. Great job Rockstar . And not to mention Rockstar has great tech support I submitted a ticket they told me they would get back to me then they closed my ticket 7 days later not responding to me. But over all this game.
0;Congratulations take two you just shot yourself in the foot... seriously believe that people are gonna come back after that plunder? Good try mate. Good try Maybe don't make grinding so incredibly ing slow to entice people to buy money you stingy pieces of . Take a good hard look at the kickback from your recent escapades and realise how hard you've ed up...Edit Still don't recommend the game it's kinda boring online still has micro transactions for money... just don't
0;Love the game! Don't love the bans for people who are trying to mod it! I understand banning cheaters but not people trying to make your game live on and being more intresting.This game is there should be no microtranscions in it. the game is tedious and again. gg rockstar gg wish we could host dedicated servers. U ROCKSTAR first you dont allow private dedicated servers now you dont even allow mods.
0;GTA Online in a nutshell Before Bank robbery simulator that you didn't have to grind to have funToday Alien technology robbery simulator that wants you to grind non stop.GTA V in a nutshell Before Cool game with a cool story.Today Uh... the same because there is no updates for Single Player at all.
0;Crash happy pile of crap. Minimal settings doesnt matter DX version doesnt matter. Ask Rockstar for help hahahah.Same old GTA just a different place and I tried too hard to play it to get my money back. Got it deeply on sale for $25 and I give it a 6/10 but ultimately disappointed in what I hoped was a 9+/10 game.
0;This game is good but the online part is just trash. You need to buy shark cards for literally anything. And to buy anything useful you need to spend more than the game itself to get it. Or grind for days weeks or even months. And the fact that you idiots at *ockstar killed OpenIV's project Liberty City in V...I bought gta 4 and 5 again on pc because of this mod! I would like to ask my refund for that ame but I can't anymore.
0;Rockstar Hey boi wanna play some GTA Online?You Yeah that sounds great!Rockstar YOU! LOADING SCREEN LOADING SCREEN LOADING SCREEN LOADING SCREEN LOADING SCREEN LOADING SCREEN LOADING SCREEN GAME CRASH LOADING SCREEN ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR BUY SOME MOTHER ING SHARK CARDS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Game stinks devs are money grabbing jews probably consist of a few muslims too. Pretty pathetic game in the series not worth buying my playtime is all idle time when I went on vacation to my daddys skii lodge. this game I played about 2 hours of actual gameplay and my fricking brain fried. Boring mindless and simply Paaaaaaaaaathetic.
0;I bought the game twice once on xbox and here on PC and I was tricked into geting some sharkcards. The game it's self is well made and fun but the game has lost it's playability. It seems to get less optimized with every update and to loading screens take FOREVER.
0;"""What was once a great game has become a microtransaction ridden grindfest.Everything is too expensive to get unless you receive modded money or buy a shark card """"a cheep and affordable alternative""""where $8000000 virtual money costs more than the ing game.Don't buy it for multiplayer!Pirate if you want the singleplayer!"""
0;Idk how many times i need to install this off of a freaking gift card from walmart cuz people are too lazy to start customers with a damn disc. No wonder it took so long to be released because it still doesnt work right lol someone who does their job should prove me wrong. THANKS STEAM AND ROCKSTAR waste of $60 for about a week now trying to update your launcher.
0;Play onlinePlay all heists in order with the same team to get loyalty bonus as a ing hostDoesn't get loyalty bonus... But my friends didWrite to rockstar supportThey say you no play all missions......I was the host... how can i not have played all missions when my friends have?Then you can't reply to rockstar and ask how... Me very sad......Then my singleplayer progress gets deleted.........Very good game 10/10 100
0;Let me get something straight. I love this game. It's really fun and full of great content. The reason I do not recommend it is because of the sheer size of the game. If your computer is not designed almost exclusivley for gaming do not purchase this game as you will either run it very poorly or won't be able to run it at all.
0;If you're buying this for GTA Online DON'T.Empty servers constant crashing and the worst matchmaking I've ever seen in an online game.And on the off chance that you get in and can actually play cheaters everywhere way worse than the console version.Single player is great and the visuals on a high end pc are fantastic but do not buy this game for multiplayer...
0;THIS GAME IS FUN BUT IS EXPENSIVE AND IS FULL OF BLOODY ******* HACKERS JUST GIVING U MONEY (EVEN KNOW ITS COOL AND ALL) U CAN NEVER PLAY THE GAMES PRPLY AND U CANT JOIN THROUGH STEAM SO U HAVE TO HAVE A ROCKSTAR ACOUNT AND U CANT PLAY WITHOUT ONE AND U NEED INTERNET TO PLAY SINGLEPLAYER AND YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LOVE IT ON PS4 AND PS3 LOVED MY LIFE WHEN IT CAME OUT ON CONSOLE FOR THE FIRST TIME....... #Blessed my instergram is kade_da_man
0;to start toxic community of griefers every server self righteous pieces of sh!t who will hunt you down in attack jets with explosive round machine gun. or basically any large piece of equipment you're still trying to get. takes forever to load flight controls are obnoxious and i wish i had never bough this game.
0;The griefing is real in this game. Like REAL REAL. And what does Rockstar do about it? Adds more fuel more flying rocket shooting bikes and armored missile launcer vehicles so the griefers can get you to the point you want to give up on the game. Wasted potential. What a shameless sham.
0;The single player is great and if you have 3 other buddies to play online with also great. The MP system is ing terrible. Anticipate long waits excessive loading screens and freqent crashes and t.If you're expecting to play the game like a quasi mmo then don't buy it. The online functions are If you just want to play it offline in story mode then it's worth it the characters and the story are awesome.
0;Overall bad port.ultra vehicles control sensitivitybad spawnbad vehicle spawn (requesting your own vehicle boom otherside ofthe hills)hackers carefree house yep they keep existing and Rockstar even banned innocents more than actual hacker or scriptermicrotransection how the hell do I get those cars and bikes with rockets (literally boost and attack) while I am under Lvl 80) yes you guess it SHARKCARDS
0;I can no longer in confidence say I support GTA V Online. While it is very very fun I believe that the actions taken against the COMMUNITY by Rockstar and TakeTwo both in the forms of mass banning of players and now a legal threat against the modding community is unnacceptable. I truly wish that these issues will be fixed but at this point in time I can't say they will.
0;This is good in general but rockstar is I got banned for nothing i lost around 50 000 000 and when i could play again i got around 4 000 000 and nothing els i needed to creat a new careackter and i thing rockstar should do something about the banning system.
0;Singleplayer is Great Online is a Trainwreck. Endless loading horrible menus weird limitations &amp grinding gameplay failing to find sessions 75% of the time 30% of all sessions have cheaters in them making online unplayable for everyone. Latest update added missions that just throw you into a lobby with random strangers instead of your friends. Clearly Rockstar does not give a well neither do I.
0;Single player is pretty good I'll give it that. And the online was fun UNTIL I get banned for no reason. Seriously. I haven't played in months almost a year and I decide to start up the game only to find I've been permanently banned. Forever. No reason no warning nothing. Seriously R* what the hell.
0;Rockstar is happy to let modders/hackers run rampant on multiplayer while they make bank off the players who buy shark cards. These modderse don't only spawn money which cheapens the progress you make yourself but they straight up greif other plays on the server. You can't just join another session either they're in every session and their mods follow you across sessions too.
0;Can no longer continue playing singleplayer game because of this 'unable to access RockStar server' t.I know the server connection failure are most likely caused by the commies who are currently occupying my nation. Still have to activate my game online every time I play is ing annoying! I already paid for this game for 's sake!I simply cannot recommand a game that won't even let me play.
0;After gamebreaking bugs hours of troubleshooting fresh installs and file validations I can't get past social club sign in. (Black screen error)Not to mention the 10+ support tickets I have just sitting around with no response.Funny part is it worked fine on launch.If you want a game that runs after you download it look elsewhere.If you want a game that doesn't break with every new update look elsewhere.
0;They'll just take away your money online and try to stop you from having any fun. They keep releasing DLC to make you spend any money you have. Then they justify it by saying shark cards can do it. But the people just want money so they can actually enjoy the content. They took 500mil from me and left me with 18k. I can't call in destroyed cars or pay for my apartments. I have absolutely no reason to log in. This game is dead to me. Good thing Rocket League isn't too bad yet.
0;Mods are essential to turn games into a more enjoyable experience if rockstar is against that then I won't support it. OH those mods are being used to effect online play? Maybe rockstar needs to go back to the drawing board and reaccess it's paywall game structure. ROCKSTAR and bethesda need to *stop this attack on their customers who want to enhance a product they paid you for.
0;Pros Good PC optimisation Rich contents Free updates/DLCs Decent graphic Great story/mission ( Only for singleplayer )Cons Buggy gameplay Dull character movement Microtransation for In game money Large population of cheaters in online Useless anti cheating system Rockstar is disinterested in PC communityConclustion Rocstar is the new EA the EA that hates PC.
0;i made the mistake of cheating and got banned for a month which is fair enough and made me stop cheating. However just today i forgot to remove a couple of single player mods from my files as was given an instant permanent ban. Rockstars anti cheat is an absolute joke. However the single player in this game is very good
0;Great single player mode. Multiplayer mode is rubbish full of exploits which are used frequently. No fun playing against people with god mode and a variety of other such nasty cheats. Its a joke that a company that makes so much money out of this game and the ones before cant remove the exploits. A real shame. My advice to Rockstar is stick to single player.
0;The CEO of Take Two Interactive talks about consumers of GTA V as if they're slaves. He concocts ways to squeeze money from the playerbase on their game that is now many years old. Not only this then suddenly Open IV is now ERASED. After years of mods they suddenly rip them all away from everyone! THESE ARE BASTARDS. YOU ARE LUCKY I DON'T FIREBOMB YOUR GOD DAMN STUDIOS YOU STUPID INSIGNIFICANT SCUM F*CKERS.
0;ALOT of bugs glitches and crashes all the time alot of problems with connecting to sessions the lobby spitting then finally when you are in a session there are at least 1 modder/hacker and everyone kills on sight overall not a great experience if it wasn't for the car/bike community i would even be playing this game anymore.
0;It was great when it worked but now it's stuck in an infinite load loop and is unplayable. Spent hours trying out different troubleshooting techniques to fix the issue (including full reinstallation) but it's just no longer worth the time and effort.Fix your Rockstar.
0;This game used to be great!BUT IT'S NOT ANYMORE!!!You should avoid supporting publisher that don't give a about their customers. The only thing they care is MONEY loads of money.Nice shot in your leg Take Two. I hope next one will finally hit your head!
0;Please do not buy this crap. U wont even be able to open the game because the launcher is not working the site where you can download the newest launcher doesnt work. Tried sending them a support ticket but i can not make an account because the link isnt working. Crap allround
0;It was good at first befor kids learned how to script and befor rockstar blamed me for things i wasnt doing but now since the kids learned how to script the game i just hate it now. if you dont agree well think about it this way you go into a season with some bad scripters who need attention at home and keep blowing the session up and keeps killing you when your haveing fun... now doesnt that just sound like fun? D
0;"""The game itself is great and runs great on my PC the ISSUE is the damned social club REQUIRED login. you can put steam offline i guess but that never worked for me. this is the SECOND time my danged account has been locked and i am sick of it because it NEVER happens in other games. Its sad to say when you have to look to """"other methoods"""" to play a game you legitly paid for. Doesnt matter if you dont want to play GTA Online. it requires the damn login for snlge player as well."""
0;"""Waited 2 years and got a sub par port with a broken social club. All the polishing in the world cannot fix Rockstar's awful customer service and horrible work ethic. """"Yeah release the PC version when ever January 27th March 24th or April 14th what ever is most convienent."""" Rockstar2/10 Best consumer molestation simulator on the market for full price after two years of being released on consoles.Would reccomend to those who like extreme disappointment and anal violation."""
0;I've played this game for a long time with my friends but now it just doesn't feel the same as it used too. I did love this game but a huge chunk of it is missing especially with modding becoming illegal. The main reason why many people came to PC to play gta is for the mods and without them it's not the same.
0;Really fun if you can over look other players killing you every two seconds cause there like leve 98 and you are just a ten or that they can take your money that you bought but don't cheat or the'll ban you ...alll and all good game lame company running it . just look at the post about random bans . They know people are haking it and they put a robot in charge of the bans . ? wow lame .
0;Garbage gameIs this game against the Chinese? A new number can only play 36 hours to cover me for 32 daysR star server can give me to check out the abnormal data you do not have to use the accelerator did not open the accelerator with what I have to seal
0;I don't think I have seen a DLC policy as bad as GTA V's. A gold paint scheme for a jet costs over a hundred. real. life. dollars. Then on top of that they went and started removing the ability to mod single player. Rockstar sucks. Do the gaming world a favor and don't support them.
0;"""Annoying modders in all sessions.They used mods (explosions invulnerable mod stealth) for kills trolling and doing another Maybe it should to block using mods or at least check mods on client and notify all players in session for further action (report kicks or do nothing). But """"community"""" of trolls against.P.S. more blocked modders more buying copies of game at least."""
0;this im out.every single time the game me up with bugsIve at least wasted totally 3 hours to prepare for those missionbut eventually being ed with stupid kids lag and the bugsMake every things expensive just want me to waste my money to buy your gta currencygo your self GTA
0;story mode is decent. but online is absoloute I got banned for using a mod menu for quick cash and now i can not visit online mode anymore. Rockstar is hungry for money. Shark cars are way overpriced. Do yourself a favour and just play watchdogs instead.
0;Dont buy this game if you are legit... Its a good game but I would not recomend it. Mabye if you have many friends that play it sure. Grinding this game is to tidious for my taste. Fun to mess around in and if you hack everyone either hates you or loves you p Just dont instal viruses instead of hax xDlul this is probbably not what putri meant when she told me to write rewievs for my games xDDD Im a child inside D
0;"""Rockstar has locked new """"Free DLC"""" for the online game version behind huge pay walls in the form of requiring you to buy property in order to purchase vehicles. Additionally they have neglected single player version of the game by not adding these new vehicles to it. Normally this would be a problem because it would have been modded in later however now mods are banned. My recommendation buy it only when it is on sale for at least 60% off."""
0;This game is pure s h i t e...when it was on Xbox 360 and PS3 it had no such issues...like super expensive cars than story version and reducing mission payout... Rockstar games are money w h or e s.Good single player campaigns but s h i t ty onlineEdit got banned for one month after doing 2 hiest finale great..this game sucks
0;"""Flying cars/bikes that can shoot rockets ruin the entire lobby their ability to do anything GTA5 started of as an amazing game but turned into ''unrealistic'' &amp ''troll supporting"""" very quick this game is no longer fun to play in online mode because of these idiotic discisions to support trolls with flying cars/bikes reporting is no point because 2 reports won't do anything"""
0;The worst online experience ever. Korean and Chinese hackers are everywhere. Literally you'll die by their weapon hacks or being blocked by their building hacks ever single minute. And nothing's being done on it. I do rather you stick to CSGO where they at least have done something about it. Shame on the devs.
0;Single player is ok but the multiplayer is absolute trash. They don't allow us to mod the game or play on our own multiplayer servers so they can sell us Sharkcard gta money! fcuuk that sh!t I got the game for the multiplayer so im fcuuked. Pirate the game for the single player. Do not buy until they let us mod!
0;RockStar today you must give me an explanation my online account does not violate any online service agreement why should you banned my account I can't understand including me many of my friends have been banned my id is woshi66CH. If you see this comment please remove my ban which is why this several days suddenly received a lot of bad review reason
0;I bet you think i'm going to tell you taketwo has banned modding?It feels like that but no that's not what i'm asshurt aboutSHARK CARDS FAILURE TO BAN CHEATERS DRY GAMEPLAY ONLINE GRINDING ZERO REPLAY VALUEand soooooo much more. thanks for turning a promising game into a cash cow. Really generous of you guys
0;If you want to become neurotic buy it. Rockstars I dont know what you guys thinking but you guys are fu*** disrespectful to your customers. WHAT ARE THOSE LOADING TIMES??? How the hell you s think this is acceptable? Sory guys. I love GTA series. I played every single one of them. But your online sucks.
0;I cannot recommend this game for 1 good reason.If you happen to want to play it on your laptop away from home or when your internet happens to be down for some reason..You can't. You must be connected to the internet at all times to play this game.I understand why for multiplayer obviously.. but I travel a lot and this is one single player game I cannot play at all when I do. Rockstar eat poo.
0;I wouldn't reccomend this game if you are on an older computer and have little to no patience.I purchased the game July 5th 2018. At the time of this review it is July 7th 2018. Not sure if it's normal for a game to take two days to download and install...Otherwise I have yet to play the game and experience the gameplay. I will post a review on that in the near future.
0;SHARK CARDS!!! SHARK CARDS!!! SHARK CARDS!!! Do you want to play friend only lobbies and grind cash with your buddies guess what you can only do crappy missions that pay almost nothing. So your options are play in a public match with 10 year olds screaming or hacking the game or SHARK CARDS!!! SHARK CARDS!!! SHARK CARDS!!!. Seriously eat my Rockstar games i will never buy one of your overrated piles of again you lost a long time customer.
0;The single player side of this game is amazing. The modding scene is also amazing asides Take2 seem fairly adamant that it is awful and that it must be destroyed. The multiplayer is however utterly Unless you like the jobs or like spending real money on virtual items than don't bother.
0;I reported a guy for force crashing people in the lobby. He was selling money and RP and cuasing people who disagreed with it to crash. So I thought Rockstar would get em right? I get on the next day to be banned for 30 days. Honnestly what in the world.
0;Nice game. Able to run it on not good PC. BUT no cloud save.........Rockstar social club logs me out somehow and to log in I need to do the Im not a robot thing. The even more thing is they only tell you password is wrong after you did the whole not a robot thing. I dont care about rockstart password. if I linked it to my steam stop asking me to sign in. Hate this.
0;Whenever I open the menu it's just very sluggish an. The mouse cursor is not responsive at all and I have to press the direction buttuns several times on my controller to even get to another page. I don't know what is causing this but i deffinetly makes for a frustrating experience.
0;Hackers Hacker and Hackers full of Hackers .... and Hackers and Hackers and Hackers . It takes only 1 hacker each game to ruin the whole gameee .. Hackers and Hacker and Hackers and Hackers ... You absoutely get no info the outcome of your report .. and Hacker and Hackers and hacker.. Hackers UNknown Hacked Grounds.
0;This game was made by incredibly greedy people who only care about their own personal gain its a fun game but if you want money in game you have to have either money in real life or infinite time and an extremely long attention span because this game is boring as most of the time
0;Extremely buggy. Rockstar should have never put out a PC version if they were going to do it like this. Steam big picture mode does not help the situation so it is hard to say what the source of the repeat crashes. Rockstar suggests that it is a video issue which is laughable. I guess that I will dig up my old XBox360 if I want to play GTAV. Major fail by Rockstar and/or Valve.
0;Good singleplayer campaign Nice graphics Terrible loading times Terrible Social Club DRM that prevents you from accessing the game Terrible servers Online is plagued with cheaters with Rockstar not caring at all Microtransaction garbageIf you just want to play this game for the singleplayer you shouldn't find much problems with this.But if you're buying this purely to play online then good luck with that.
0;I only recommend this game if you have more than 8 friends playing this game actively otherwise playing Online mode is impossible there is no way you are gonna be able to find random players who understand the game or even able to find random players at all. the rest of the game is great though.
0;Payed 45 for this piece of game played for 200 + hours and then i went permanently banned for no reason just because i have a internet dont mean that i am cheating THIS I AM OUT!!!!Only buy the game for the single player.P.S. You can only play the single player campaign if you have internet !! (WFTFFF)
0;Riots servers are still running on windows 95... The gameplay is quite cool. But wating an hour or more before entering online mode is not okay... If u wanna spend money on this game be my guest! Not worth it. Only play this if u wanna have fun in singleplayer.
0;my friend bought gta5 and he couldnt play it because of an error of rockstar social club. it is really shameful for rockstar who take many from customer and in return no service. We search on the internet for that problem we try to contact with rockstar authorities who has responsible for this situation and nothing... it is really dissappointing. we would expect more from you. what a shame for these thiefs )
0;Played for 165 hours and now i have this message everytime i try to start the game. Unable to connect to Rockstar Servers. Activation of GTA V requires an Internet connection. Please check your connection and click Retry or click Cancel to quit.Tried everything i could find on Google but nothing works. Tried everything they replied with on my ticket and still doesn't work.Game is great but it doesn't work which makes it bad.
0;Great Game of course but Take Two has just shut down mods essentially which DO NOT directly interfere with the multiplayer of the game lots of people only bought the game on PC for mods so us the community are TAKING A STAND. I enourage anyone else who cares about modding in any game to do the same! We need our voices to be heard against Take Two!
0;OFF THIS ING GAME IDIOTS ROCKSTAR BEFORE WE HAD HACKERS NOW EVERYONE LEAVES HEIST OR IS JUST NOOBS THERE PLEASE DO SOMETHING HEIST FOR 4 PEOPLE CAN BE DONE WITH 2 PEOPLE SO PLEASE MAKE 2 4 PEOPLE NOT ONLY 4 PEOPLE IDIOTS I ALWAYS GET ED BECAUSE OF THIS NOOBS IDIOTAS
0;Not recommended. The removal of mod support for PC has to be the worst for GTA. They also took down services such as transfer of characters which is an important part of enjoying a game on different platforms. Never again. Not going to buy GTA ever again.
0;Grand Theft Auto V Launcher has stopped workingA problem caused the program to stop working correctly.Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available. Debug Close program 2/10 would not reinstall 3 times verify files 5 times or bother with Rockstar support again.All in all the game was fun while it lasted but now it doesn't work and there's no fix.
0;"""I buy it doesn't even work. I tried getting a refund but it said I have played it for to long when I can't even start the game. It just tells me """"the game has exited unexpectly"""" its rather its broken and I was scammed for the most part. Or its just a glitch. Anyone know?"""
0;Cannot figure out how to play with friends online. Came back after quiting for a while because of the huge amount of hackers. joined game killed and someone flyhacking giving money to everyone. Good to see still hacking is plentiful. And unable to play with friends unless you jump through sooooo many hoops its not worth playing this game
0;It's a great game but the tippin gpoint has come for me... I have a decent rig and the game worked for a year but it's now so buggy crashy and takes soooo long to load or do anything it's actually put me off the franchise. Sad as I was a big fan. I know nobody cares but it's just sad.
0;After 2 days of playing GTA V it's such a realistic Los Angeles replica. But there is a Big Defect!!! There is no Lowrider Car customization!!? No Hydralic available and no custom lowrider paint job(which exsist in San Andreas). And also The Declasse Voodo(Chevy Impala) only comes with a rusted version no clean car available so dissapointed!
0;i very much liked the singleplayer story and gameplay.and then i discoverd modding and even had more fun with it.and 2k the perent company of rockstar are now basiclliy banning moding in gta v just so you buy more microtransactions in the online multiplayer.
0;No mod support they recently added a bunch of junk code that made a very well optimized game not be able to run rockstar social cub is a ing joke and has locked me out OF MY OWN ACCOUNT and i need to be signed into it to get it all reset. This game is fun to goof around with but it the online is abosolutly riddled with hackers. I do not recommend this game at all it's gotten worse over time and i really wish i could get my money back for it.
0;This would be a good game if modding was still a thing.Take Two Interactive and Rockstar I have a present for you......................./ /) .................... / ../ .................../..../ ............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...') ......... .................'...../ ..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............( .............. ............. ...
0;Game overall is fun but the more I play it the more often I have CTD errors self radio randomly breaks the entire vehicle stereo system and have random frame drops down to 10FPS. Wouldn't recommend for PC get it on console as this game is clearly not optimized well for PC.
0;This game was delayed extraordinarily to introduce a project to the market that gets old fast and has a horrible community. It's overhyped and frankly an embarassment to the GTA series. Pirate it at least you can see strip club s the only innovation done in the game.
0;gta iv is better. Noobie car system. Some mission you headshot a guy again and again but he cannot dead cause he wear armor? lol its armor dude head is totally fraggile. Spend most of the time not driving but loading the game. Noob multiplayer system. Waste of money. Hope you dont make gta6 untill things are RIGHT! NOOBIE ROCKSTAR
0;I am absolutely disgusted by the behavior of Rockstar games and especially Take Two Interactive. I will never by another game under the title of those two horrific and garbage companies that disrespect their communities. DO NOT BY THIS GAME OR ANY OTHER ROCKSTAR GAME EVER!
0;Played it before on ps3 with no stuttering really. I got it on my pc it runs ok for a little while SOMETIMES. Most of the time it stutters so bad I don't want to play it now it hurt my stomach. I got r9 270x 2gb graphics all settings to lowest can go 12 gbs ram quad core cpu. I want to delete this game now that is how bad the stuttering is. IT IS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything is up to date. All settings in CCC are also on low this pc is all optimized for gameplay.
0;As fun as the game is it is now anti modding even for single player and vehicles and other things you can buy for online are so inflated in price to sell more shark cards if you have a job or anything else where you can't dedicate 15 hours a day to it it'll take you weeks to get that new item unless you buy shark cards.
0;I'll be honest I like money. Especially in GTA. When a hacker joined my game and started giving me millions I was ecstatic. I had 80 million and everything in the game. Then without even installing a mod I was banned from the game forever. My friends received the same treatment from the hacker and they still play on today. Sort it out rockstar.
0;sorry but i just can't recommend this game anymore. r* and taketwo failed to handle all the cheaters in this game and they decide the best way to do it is to disable and do a legal cease and desist order to all other legit mod maker available for this game. this is pure evil. instead trying to fix their game they decide to kill mods that keeps the game alive for many years. so screw you r* may you all rot in hell.
0;Product received for free. I started playing this game with mods and OpenIV and if there was something wrong I uninstall it and install it back and my mods are gone and I download them back. Well I messed up on one of my files and uninstalled it and installed it back and you're probably wondering that my files reseted no they ing didn't I reuninstalled it 2 more times and I still got a ing error on my game and now I can't even open my god damn game. Please fix this
0;This game isn't fun! The campaign is a little bit. Online is worst. The main thing is that you have to but money!!!Without having any money to spend you end up wanting to hack the game which results in a game ban which is exactly what I did!So unless you wanna spends hundreds of dollars or end up doing missions for your whole life this game is bad for the poor.Not recommended! Ice
0;Played this game loved everything Got ban for 1 month did deserve that for modding Then started playing again after a month.After playing received an email stating my account has been permanently banned.Did like 10 15 emails to Rockstar support and the reply is coming from a bot.
0;The doomsday update broke this ing game. The deluxes homing rockets seem to hit everything even when I use the oppressor impossible to dodge. In general is this game more based on modders becuase some cars cost 4million up to 6 million and a shark card with 8 million costs 100$. Rockstar is out of ideas so i think they should make a GTA 6 now. Sample1
0;It is a fun game. I have obviously spent many hours playing it. Good story good online for the most part. After taking a break to play other games for awhile I then return wishing to drive down random sidewalks once more. BAD NEWS ROCKSTAR SOCIAL WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO LAUNCH THE GAME.With this I cannot recommend the game.
0;Loadin.... loading.... loading..... Loadin..... Loadin...... Loadin.... There are only few heist. This game is not much compared to its price.... and ROCKSTAR fu*king start dealing with them cheaters it kills the game. After i get beck home from a long day at work i want to relax dullmyself a bit and grindsomething but with the server loading and cheating its so fing fustratig
0;Single player mode is quite nice but Online mode is a complete disaster. You get put into missions with others without asking for it you get kicked off your friends only server for going to the bathroom and everything is a complete mess making it a horriffic experience trying to understand the game.
0;This game was so good. it has a great singleplayer. but i cant reccomend it because of the money hungry take two. apparently. having one of the best selling games ever just. isnt enough for them. they need to shut down mods and do anything they can to squeeze more cash out of people
0;GTA Online Loading screen simulator + Excessively expensive EVERYTHING.They ban you for no reason.They won't let you use mods in offline mode.They released the game for PC several months after consoles.They will keep treating us like sh*t.F*ck Rockstar.
0;RIP OpenIVCongratulations R* and Take Two. You have Mannaged to crush the last ounce of fun from this game.The online expirience is tewrrible and the so called 'free' DLC is such an obvious money grab attempt. Never again will i waste my money on you stingy developers. Best of luck selling your worthless shark cards now! s
0;The game in its self is just a masterpiece story is extremlly well crafted and charecters actually metter. But i mean most gamers have already experienced it and played for at least 20hours.The problem is the online thingy rockstar for the past year or so are just milking the game and making it more and more grindy.
0;It's sad to see such an amazing company like rockstar turn to the ways of EA. If they want to over their long time fans fine. Those review scores show we wont stand for this and Red Dead 2 and any future titles will be seen with alot skepticism. All their games from here on out will have microtransactions which ruin the online.
0;This game is good however Rockstar's parent company Take Two are ruining the freedom of single player modders who are harming nobody except for Take Two's huge desire for mass micro transactions. Please do not support this game until Take Two stop their 'Cease and Assist' on the best thing that happened to GTA single player Open IV.
0;"""After buying this game 4 seperate times and the final time on PC to """"PURRLY MOD SINGLEPLAYER"""" If your going to try and fix this work with them to fix the issuses that you have insted of creating a biger problem. I will untill the ban is lifted never buy another Take Two Game."""
0;Constantly adding content relatively bug free incredible multiplayer great fun.EDIT 2 years laterThe game's community shrinks and shrinks with modding being a common place thing to do. After all it creates a new experience and gives more motivation to play whether that be single player or online.Nice job rockstar and your parent company you really did it this time.
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GANE ON PC. They do not give support to PC players and they also ban people falsly and reset your charactor It is BS that they refuse to give u all of ur shark card money after they ur charactor. I suggest NEVER buy this for steam. I have spent 3k on shark cards reported over 50 players for modding and they banned me after 1200 hours of clean play.
0;Good job off your entire community. Modding is what gives GTA life with their lackluster updates that can only be done by either grinding out 24 hours for 1 vehicle or buying the overpriced shark cards. Do not support R* anymore. It's sad to see them go downhill like this.
0;One of the worst and most furstrating online modes I have experienced. Unbearable grind just a few fun heists leavers unplayable due to hackers and cheaters.The offline singleplayer story mode is one of the best Ive seen. Im done with GTA Online for good. And I fear for Red Dead 2.....
0;THEIR SUPPORT IS SUCKS I got banned because modding in STORY MODE while I'm connected to the internet. Their system thought I mod in Online because I'm Connected to the Internet. Call Centre is only a maching with no person to talk Submit a ticket is just a COPY PASTED word from their Terms of Service. Game Is good but the support is very bad.
0;The only thing left in this game is kids still in highschool with only the intent of killing everyone in sight and added content to get you to spend money. but now the added content makes you do a series of unskippable escort missions and endless unfunny unskippable cutscenes just so you can get the one thing you need to upgrade any of the new fun vehicles. unless your playing on a formal rp server this game is the least fun ive had in a long while.
0;ROCKSTAR! I like the game and all but it gets so boring... And the company used to SUPPORT mods. Now these are banning them! Mods are one of the ing things that makes the game fun... Its a sandbox game! YOUR SUPPOSED TO MOD! So in conclusion Rockstar Take Two and GTA ONLINE! Im not a modder on GTA just for the fact that I do not want to get banned
0;5th time I bought this game last time I buy any of take twos products or rockstar played a few months got back to level 70 got accused of nodding my a modder. Friend was actually doing it lost everything. Over 1000 invested in game all gone do to their poor system. Dont spend money in this game fair warning griefers will win.
0;Piece of 2K/Rockstar ing up once again. I couldnt give 2 about online but taking out modding in singleplayer?? Thats too far considering that it doesnt effect online or you weighty pockets. 2K/Rockstar fix this t before its too late and people begin to boycott this now game.Dont get me wrong i love gta 5 but in its current state it deserves a down vote (((((((((((((((((((
0;In some odd sickening sense of irony the creators of Grand Theft Auto V have committed theft against me of my cash and time.Without a single warning banned for a month like that and any and all progress which had taken a multitude of months to accomplished vanished without a trace. Customer support provided no rhyme or reason and that was that.Absolutely disgusting.
0;i used to love this game and this company. but recent events showcase they do NOT care about their player base and ONLY care about gouging us for more and more SHARK CARDS. Not only do these force us to pay them but the ing steal EARNED money from their player base.I EARNED $700k and some modder gives me $400k and rockstar takes it ALL.THEY TOOK ALL OF MY MONEY EVEN THE EARNED THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AND THEM.
0;"""loads of cheaters and modders still around this game ... got banned because i got dropped 1 billion in game currency from a random person i did wrote a letter to rockstar they said why did use multiplayer mods even though i've sent a recording from the process as well ) ) even bought a shark card in the past year but yes im a """"hacker"""" D thank you for nothing really.."""
0;Gave GTA5 a fair chance...storywise it's the worst gta to date online is repetitive and has a broken economy ment to trick you into buying sharkcards in order to avoid the endless and repetitive grind. If you have a modded account the game feels less broken (I assume xd) sometimes but eventually its gonna get boring fast It just isn't a good game in my humble opinion. Bought tk2's stock some time ago when the whole online started. Sold it this year at least they didn't that up too xd
0;SIngle Player story mode was great and well done. Multiplayer was just okay considering the hype and now if you wanted to spice it up with a little modding it doesn't seem likely. Hopefully they can sell a few extra cheat codes for their credibility! Also anybody paying attention to Bethesda and creation club? Maybe jump on that too ya junts.
0;It takes years to load online when its willing to even load. I have good internet 150 up 80 down on a slow day but gta online rarely loads within half an hour i know they like money but maybe fix one of the oldest problems in the game before making tonnes of dlc.
0;For any new players joining the game. You will have very little fun expect flying motorcycles to rocket you wherever you go and reach every objective before you. You are not alowed an rpg until lvl 60 ingame making the first 100 hours absolutely joyless. It is clear they do not care about balance or new players. how they managed to make such a bad game with 100s of millions confuses me.
0;Out of principle I cannot recommend this game. It has a weak single player story line and is effectively one of the worst software products as a whole I have ever tried with loadings screens that stretches for 5 10 minutes and the definite worst multiplayer implementation of any game ever.
0;yeah hackers are a problem...but this isn't gonna fix it.games pretty great on free content side of things but i look at streamers like eli and his community and his fellow streamers on the same server or similar.so yeah... ima support the peeps who use mods for good.
0;FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU TAKE TWO!
0;Not recommended for online since youre going to get banned after a month for no reason ive never cheated or did anything that would be against the terms and service and still got banned for 100% no reason you rockstar! just becasue you make billions of dollar doesnt mean you can treat innocent players like and do nothing about the cheater that ACUTULLY void the terms and service
0;Yep so people have been complaining about the ban thingy. And it's true a small modification on the game files can gets you banned whelp. I guess this game can't make a difference between online and offline mode! And people that always hacking in the game never gets banned how Great!
0;This game is the biggest piece of poo i have ever played. After playing this game i suffered from loss of brain cells and chromosomes. I strongly recommend you dont play this game and just play roblox gta it is a much better game with much better graphics. I hate this game so much. Screw you rockstar you communist sclungs. This game is not for fellow history nuts.
0;Take Two they just ruined GTA V......................./ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...')......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...
0;Well now that this game is full of hackers and outdated with Ps3 graphics at best. Watch Dogs 2 is way better and no hackers you play one that s it. F. u. c. k. this s. h. i. t. if you don t want to get hacked don't play this game or if you value your bank account .... sadly i recommend to pirate this s. h. i. t. not because of money issues for security and peace of mind cause not being online is just fine with me with this title .. story is good
0;I have changed my mind about GTA VTake two has shown a remarkable amount of greed in the past few years shoving useless DLC down our throats.. all at the same time silencing the real thing that was fun about this game single player modding. For this alone I can no longer recommend this game.
0;Plays online with a buddy goes to his apartment and get drunk as hell on wine and whiskey. Then we take a hit from the bong and go to the bedroom we kill eachother and our bodys fall out of the window. 1337/420 would get drunk again.EDIT It's actually really good don't check my game hours but instead make your's higher.also this t about 25discount on 80 dollars or something dont ask me about it since i was busy playing the game while that happend Sincerely Eriqoua Darkyfox Sweden
0;worked perfectly fine until it suddenly just crashes saying that the game data is corrupt and i should reinstall the game. i can still start the game until it randomly just crashes again i dont know what the problem is ive tried reinstalling and so but nothing is working... I paid for this ame and i cant play it for 15 minutes until it crashes my pc has a gtx 1060 16gb ram intel i7 7600k it shouldnt have a problem running this. if this really cant be fixed then this game is a disgrace...
0;The single player game is ok nothing specal stands out. online play is just sad rockstar does not deal with hacker or cheats and you can see after first little bit of time you spend online. going to go to my car tank falls from sky kills you .... walking down street some guy come and shots in a indestructible car ... cheater dropping mil of dollars on player so that you crash ... in the end rockstar does not care about cheater or hacker in the game any more and they run free and ruin the game
0;Great game scumbag publishers. Even before the whole OpenIV mess GTA Online has long been plagued by hackers &amp unjust bans and nothing has been done about it because this game is an untouchable cash cow to Take Two. Greed and complacency are all it is. If you buy this game you are enabling them.
0;Single player is fun. This could be one of the best online games ever. Rockstar will bleed your wallet. If you want to grind it out and not pay to win (more like pay not to get trolled) you still have to deal with stuff like trolls in a jet fighter droping bombs on your head when your trying to get around town doing the grind. The other players are toxic. I lost all enjoyment playing this game online. I want it to be good but the system is screwed with the pVp killing going on
0;"""Got banned for a month assumed it however when i came back after a month ban I got banned permentaly!I hate rockstar now the only thing they can say is """" ... In addition understand that the action placed on your account is final and will not be canceled."""
0;Negative review for extremely long loading times of GTA Online and the recent actions of Take Two against Open IV modding tools.Sometimes physics might be silly mior bugs first person mode is quite disappointing default controls for keyboard and mouse are not very good annoying camera silly crowd shoutouts.Surprisingly decent optimizations and nice graphics gameplay wise has GTA flavour.Next step after GTA 4 certainly. Nextgen ? If you say so.
0;Take Two CancerYou can take 2 of these YouAlmost forgot you too R*Don't defend those ers at R* they are the ones who make the games they could easily solve this problem if they wanted to all they have to say is TT calm the down or I find myself a new distributor for RDR2. Problem solvedControl your bia tch R*
0;The grind is real on this one unless you decide to spend half your irl paycheck to actually be able to buy that nice looking car you just stay stuck at that point between supply costs and your actual payout from doing these tedious mission's they offer... if you don't have a friend to play this with dont even bother buying this.
0;GTA Online Loading Simulator...In Online Mode are playing only retard kids under 18.. They don t play heists they only killing themselves in free mode and a lot of cheaters ! Huge amount of them ! Also this police wanted system... sux like hell ! It s the worse system which has been created so far! F*cking police know where you are always ! Eeven when you fire a gun with silcener in the desert police will find you !
0;don't buy this if you're expecting a good multiplayer experience. it's plagued with small server population (per lobby not overall population) as well as people using scripts and what not to get an unfair advantage over everyone else.Singleplayer is fun but let down by the fact the devs refuse to add any of the MP content to SP. This can be alleviated with mods but it takes a while to set them up.
0;I would say get the game but you get pushed around a lot of racist remarks little kids and a total not worth it for money grind it takes 2 hours to get 100k but the thing you want is 24 million and that will give you a total of 20k a hour have fun its a waste the only way to get substantial money is to get hacked or modded OH YEA dont forget the KD warriors who have a need for being noticed in a game they have played for as long as its been out
0;I never liked GTA Online mostly because MM is about as competent as a jellyfish trying to learn quantum mechanics also because of hackers. I use a trainer on SP just to get inf ammo and all that just to have fun and have an ENB to make it look cool. Well I had if it werent for Take Two being s for money and telling their playerbase to take a long walk off a short pier.
0;NOW I am MADwe wanty the Liberty City Mod not some character changing mod or whatever many people wanted to play the Liberty City in GTAV mod and were pumped up for it and how is it agaiunst modding policy unless you feel like it is distributing a different game for free then release it as a DLC yourself it will GREATLY help rejuvenate the game and will briung in more players or make inactive players more active
0;I am not a modder nor do I use mods. However I think Take Two really screwed the pooch on this whole OPENIV thing. There are still hackers dropping money bags all over gta online so I am kinda confused..What was the point? To punish the loyal players of the game and do nothing to the hackers?
0;RIP OpenIV.*Edit* Okay I am happy to be wrong in this situation. Still as far as online goes this game is pretty Matchmaking with friends being difficult at times (what is this uplay?) combined with excessive grind for cash as a push for the playerbase to give in and buy shark cards. I mean I've made it through 99% of a heist just to have 1 friend parachute in to a cliff and the mission is failed.If you want a review of the single player look elsewhere. I heard its short but pretty good.
0;singel play is okay good story lots of side missions to!online is where the the bad part is... it's the bigest grind fest u can think of (if u like to grind there u go!) almost everything is overpriced! loads of hackers from time to time and other wise there is some other bs it's okay but more of a 50/50
0;Online play is bad without friendsFriend just got banned even though he just got the game from steam summer sale he just installed the game and played online for 15 mins with us before getting banned for no reason. He is not a modder or a hacker in any games. I had smillar issue once also years ago. And real cheaters are also still in the game fine. Joined a server recently with people exploding everywhere. Rockstar games fix your game and not sit on your pile of cash
0;its like br ragnarok cant shoot them meanwhile they stand there not moving untill the perfect moment when the 30 shots you put in their ing head didint reg and they realise you are shoothing at them and one shots you GG russia one way reg gg pro mlg but I still bought the game twice.That being said Armored Kukaracha all day Passive Mode &amp Heists GG
0;The flying controllers on PC in this game are bad. I don't get my bullets back when I die.The police can kill me when I'm running.I can't run away when someone hits me. The police spawn right in front of me when the road looks like it's safe.I lose money when I die.The police can kill me with one shot.
0;pro single player story is nice!cons single player is dead to rockstar (online content gets no single player release ie low riders)pro now with multiplayercons multiplayer sucks hardand btw it is STILL 60 bucks? you gotta be me....edit 1 year later still 60 bucks. and they shoved a c&amp d up (offline!!!!) modders rear. are you kidding me?next gta will be pirated i promise you....
0;Any game that tries to crush the single player modding community active for years while the publisher will shamelessly sell ingame cash for $40.00 is not worth the money. (Yes I can afford it but I will not pay for a game a second time thats assinine)
0;Ok overall not gonna lie this game is pretty good and what is the most enjoyable is gta online but rockstar are f****n a******s so im playin GTA online and a modder gives me money right so i obviously aint gonna get mad over free money so i just accepted next thing i know im f****n suspended for a month holy S**t its not fair
0;When you first come into the story line you will meet a little kitty in the street corner. I tried to hold that cat and pressed some keys instead touching the kitty the character I controlled kicked the kitty. And it's dead. Definitely the worst gaming experience in my human life.Yes I AM a kitty lover.Highly not recommended.Edited Jun 16th 2017Just heard about the lawsuit from Take Two to the mod tools Open IV negative review remained.
0;Where do I start. This game was amazing on consoles but pc is meh. The story is very good but online is just a huge NO. They ban you for anything and then you try to tell them it wasnt you and they dont read your appeal. Ive been banned twice because some hacker gave me money and there was nothing i could do. I recommend story mode but online is so screwed up dont waste 60$. Buy saints row or just cause much better games on PC.
0;Crashes 99% of the time Then lags for 5 mins. After this runs like a dream however the stats required are missleading. I have 2 times the amount needed with the norton on. norton takes 1% of ram and then as soon as I start up gta 5 everything lags as gta 5 takes all 7 cores and 16gb ram. Really Rockstar Good game my
0;Sent a cease and desist to the creator of a singleplayer modding tool developer who's been doing this for 10 years because Take Two claims it can make cheats.It can't it's strictly locked to singleplayer. They're banning something that literally has NOTHING to do with their problem.
0;I really love this game its pretty much my favorite game of all time but for one soul purpose I cannot reccomend this and this is due to the huge amount of modders about evrey online game I get in theres a ing modder. They take awway your weopons blow you up it honestly just ruins the fun. If you can find a game without modders this game is extremly fun with freinds. Also props to rockstar for the good amount of updates and content to keep this game fun.
0;If you purchase this game from Steam you will not be able to play it offline. What an encouragment to actually pay for your games.GTA6 will be torrented and cracked the minute it is released. Not my fault if they make people that pay for their games put up with so much t.I'll gladly prefer some Russian trojan keygen to Rockstar Social Club on my PC.Over and out!
0;my son declan desperately wanted this game so as a loving mother i bought it for him. however i come to beieve that this game has made my son extremely flamboyant in other words made him really gayso single mothers out there please be aware that this game has a slight chance of making your son very much a disappointmentalso i disowned my sonthis game ing sucks

0;Wait a few days to buy this game unless you want to have to deal with all the bugs crashes and all around t that you have to deal with like Redoing the tutorial 10 times because of game crashes or having max frames then all of a sudden the game crashes due to a fatal error with no number code.
0;This is most certainly a great PC game. Very nice graphics wonderful optimization gameplay is as usual in a GTA AKA very good.If found the story entertaining as well however a few parts were somewhat of a drag.Overall I'd recommand it in a heartbeat if it weren't for Take2's ttery. They had the most successful game ever in term of gross revenue and had to try and milk it some more. No mods in a gta seriously? What the hell were you thinking?Not recommended.
0;Really good game if you can play that is.About half or a quarter of the player base gets crashes of multiple kinds myself included.I can play the game but after a random time played it crashes.So...Game is 10/10Functionality is 3/10Rockstar is also not very helpful even though they have a ticket system you have to call them to get your ticket escalated within a reasonable time.
0;Never buy this game if you are intersted to play Multiplayer... it is not working properly.. i am getting kicked with error message every 5 minutes and it also shuts down my home connection... support is fully ignoring you in a case of asking ... dont buy this game NEVER...
0;Very fun trust me. But it stutters all the time and I know it's not just me because just about all my friends my brother and some youtubers have the problem too. The stuttering makes it hard to play the game and I have to restart my game many times for it to work
0;Giving this a negative review for Rockstar's stance on modding and their MP updates that continually break SP mods and make modded GTA5 literally unplayable until the modders catch up. Don't get me wrong GTA5 is a great game and made even greater by the modding community. However having unwanted updates break everything and require full reinstall of all mods is infuriating. Let us keep our mods!
0;So you wanna invest 2 years into a game to then get banned for no reason like thousands of other players? Then this game is the right choice! Buy yourself some shark cards too so you can afford at least a house in GTA Online. Go duck yourself Rockstar!
0;running windows 7 and it locks up constantly. once again good job rock star. also when it does run its like a cross between GTA IV and L.A. Noire in appearance. cops are annoyingly difficult to get rid of and cars and people slow you down A LOT when you go on a random driving rampage like I enjoy doing. I'm almost ready to go back to playing GTA IV.
0;"""Hello I have a problem with the GTA V . After a month I'm already playing the game GTA V on line . One day I suddenly can not get into the game with my Activation Code . I'm getting a message """" An unknown Rockstar Game Services error occurred . Please try again later"""" . I ask for your help urgently."""
0;Really? Cease and desist on OpenIV? People have ing bought this turd of a game because of it and now you're taking it down? you Rockstar. I'd refund this game immedaitely if I could and I would urge everyone to avoid giving their hard earned money to a piece of company such as this.
0;Single Player is great love playing it. Online play thats another story every lobby theres a modder blowing up. Got a 2 week ban for playing in a lobby with a modder who was giving free money and blowing stuff up tried to appeal it at Rstar's website but they gave no s so playing online stick to SP at least you can mod SP. Will i buy GTA6 most likely not unless the online gets fixed in a hurry
0;Bought the game hoping to play the PC version like everybody else.Every 10 mins into the game and it crashes and this has been occuring over a few hours STRAIGHT.Waited months for this PC version of the game to be released and all they can give is something that crashes every 10 minutes. GTA V is a great game but what is the use if you can't play it properly?Royal disaster. Thanks for giving such a great gaming experience for our money.
0;This game is trash. Single player is lame and boring and only no lifes play it. GTA Online anyways is even worse. They like to add insanely expensive vehicles and when you work to get them people with horrible vehicles can easily win. Don't recommend don't waste your money on this trash.
0;F***ing double DRM BS with an unitutative setup and they couldn't solve that in the month long delay. This is worse than the old series because I have to setup an account link my soical club account to my steam account then god knows what. This is terrible.
0;If I actually get into the game my gta online chracter looks like a barcode. But most of the time i get stuck at a loading screen. The same thing is happeneing to my friends like when it came out with 360 you cant get on because of the servers. I understand things like this happens at the delay of big games but its happened before and they delayed it 3 times to fix bugs. The game should be flawless right now. Once all of this gets fixed it will be a great game.
0;Absolute garbage from Rockstar. After only a week of playing it tells me that I cannot access the rockstar servers and the game will not let me play despite the fact that I do have internet and have spent 2 whole days looking online for solutions none of which worked and still haven't heard back from Rockstar tech support. Not to mention the various in game glitches that happened when I could actually play the game. Garbage company.

0;Buy this at your own risk. Looks like almost all of the negative reviews are from people who cannot even play the game due to Social Club errors. I'm currently still not able to launch the game after hours trying the possible fixes. Still no response on this issue from Rockstar after more than 1/2 a day. I rarely pre order and I sure do regret this one.
0;huge download... okay... have to play tutorial before playing onile... okay... have to use inputs to pass tutorial... okay...

0;"""Singleplayer + Multiplayer Hackers everywhere no point of going online. And just for Singleplayer you can torrent this Don't buy it.....ever...UPDATE They now made it even worse. Upsale upon upsale. Buy this buy this buy that. U know if you dont have game credits then buy a shark card. ... NO! YOU buy a shark card i already bought the game. Also all the """"DLC"""" are the same just different theme. Still negative review."""
0;Could of been a great game but online is full of hackers and there is zero support from Rockstar. Also there are a million stupid features that dont even work. Loading heists being put back in free roam quitting a game to be put half way across the map cannot click enter to chat because it will select things kicked for idleing after literally 30s ingame voice is world wide with no options etc etc etc. you Rockstar. Principal of the game is good but the execution is ing terrible
0;Don't buy this game it's ing t. There is no communism involved and all of the communist based items are not even named correctly. But anyway I decided to try and Gulag Rockstar but it did not work due to some international laws. But as i say this game isnt worth any of the hairs in my moustache.
0;Rockstar and Take Two can go f*ck themselves. Ruining online charging extreme amounts of money for fun and now the final nail in the coffin preventing people from modding singleplayer because the content modders offer is better than the content they offer. W*nkers.
0;When your board of directors of a publishing company decides to fix the anticheat by targeting singleplayer mods and not the scripters online then you've got a really big problem. Banning mods in singleplayer doesn't fix the multiplayer cheating problem. Please learn to use your brain Take Two. Fun Game Terrible publishing company.
0;"""Would love to say how great the game is it 's fun to play.. That being said it would be great having the chance to play it without these damn hackers. Too many times i join a lobby and get rained down with missles everytime i respawn or i try to do business battles with a player that is invincible has auto aim and kills me instantly. Just today i've joined 5 hacked lobbies. and to finish it off i got a bloody ddos but some sh*tty f*ck with """"GodApollo"""" in his name. REAL FUN."""
0;A really nice game but a lot of toxic haters online and no fun at all you are waiting for a mission 3/4 of the time and one time that I shoot a bunch of players a lot of cheats in the session turned me in mushroom or something. This is intolerable. Bought it on XBOX and PC even bought the console itself for this game now i regret it.
0;If you want a game that crashes cosntantly is a giant pain in the to start has literally no support for issues whatsover takes 60 dollars from you and into your granmother's fat mouth then GTAV is the game for you! What other games have a sign in service that never works and makes you reset your account evertime you play? Where else are you going to have pc destroying issues with literally no support from the developers at all. Rockstar really did it this time!
0;The game itself is pretty fun but the comunity and dev's are absolute cancer got banned for nothing contacted support asked why said they can't tell me. I think i got banned because i picked up like 20k of modded money too bad you can't choose to pick them up or not because you get put in a cage and money just starts raining on you.
0;Would like to say a word about Online You have to do something with that cheaters. Reports are seems to be absolutely pointless. Unfair players are causing havoc for hours after being reported. Players who are not using some kind of specialized software are asking cheaters for money instead of kicking them or reporting.
0;game itself is good but the fact tha mods have now been esentially removed due to 2ks cease and desist on the modding platform that most developers use there is no point getting the game on pc as it is very graphics intesive and needs a very powerful computer just get the xbox one or ps4 version ore even the xbox 360 or ps3 versions are still good
0;Don't get me wrong I have lots of pointless fun in this game. Unfortunately griefing modders make this game pretty tough to enjoy. Usually bad stuff happens when the stakes are high and there is a modder. Can't say it hasn't benfited me in many ways but Rockstar created a monster and it has lost control.
0;This game is a t sad excuse for a mobile game. The microtransactions are the sole basis of its in game economy. When people tell you that selling cars gets you money it really doesn't. This games content is full of a bunch of $100.00 DLCs in which make up the basis of this games fun. t do not buy.
0;"""If you are getting this for online play think again it's very buggy you will be playing """"online"""" in an empty world because everyone is getting disconnected every 3 minnutes.The heists are buggy game characters freeze mission objectives don't load. It's very stressful to play this game and you won't enjoy it.Rockstar isn't doing anything to fix it either it has been over 1 year now and nothing changed."""
0;hello fellow gamers of the steam community iam here to talk about the prodact Grand Theft Auto V this video game got becuse my mom told me to get off and there is no mod support ( i dont like the grind for like 1 car who explode and you get hobo really fast pls do not buy of you grind for some shirt so do not buy at the moment xD
0;I only recommend this game for playing with friends or playing alone.In my twenty hours playing ive had encounters with over 20 hackers.Driving on pc is a nightmare with tons of glitching.When I first started the tutorial I couldn't even join my friends before I finished half the dam missions.When I started online I was by high lvl players constantly.
0;Hackers are horrible matchmaking is horrible the time you need to spend on this stupid game is insane if you want anything coolI installed this game again just to see how it was the first server that I could find with players actually in it had a hacker that was spawning every other person on the server in front of his rhino tank so he could shoot you.
0;So you took mads from us I would really like it if you thought about your actions before you took them. I don't personally use them but it seems like a move to do this also I love your game but until you put mods back I am not happy at all with you. So Take2 it is time to quit having this little fit and give us our mods back.
0;Steam along side Rockstar have now made it impossible to MOD. WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT IT ON PC!!!! I OWN 2 COPIES ON PS4 1 XBOX360 XBOX1 AND ON STEAM AND YOU DONT THINK I PAID ENOUGH YOU ARE TAKING LIBERTIES WITH A PRODUCT I BOUGHT!!!! I'M HEATED ENOUGH TO LOOK UP LEGAL ACTION!(you cant do anything because we accepted the terms and conditions that we accept being steams . this may be the last straw for steam and i)
0;Product received for free. I actually like this game but the last time I can not join multiplayer mode. I admit that a couple of months ago I hacked into the multiplayer mode. I was banned from multiplayer mode. After a month I was unbanned and booted again to play multiplayer mode. But next time I went in and showed me the message when again hacking the multiplayer mode. But I do not hack on multiplayer I swear. It banned me forever. What is all this? I want my multiplayer mode back !!!

0;Typical micro transaction crapfest with bad cheat detection and now they're taking down mod support. This was the last rockstar game I will ever buy the rest I will pirate if I get an overwhelming urge to play them.Screw you T2 interactive. You are the reason we can't have nice things.
0;I used to love the GTA games but ever since GTA V came out Rockstar stopped making new games because they rely on the microtransactions. I know I am salty because I got banned i was not willing to spend thousands for a game all I wanted to do is mess around. It's time to stop by not buying or playing this 4 years old game that hates you if you don't pay them extra.
0;Sadly I am going to give this a negative review. It is so majorly polluted with hackers. They ban some for 2 weeks and a bypass hack comes out along with god mode and no you can't go passive to ignore them. They will still kill you. Single player is great and private lobby also. But if you have nobody else to play with at any given time and try joining others it gets ruined by more hackers. Rockstar needs to fix this crap. Start perma banning idiots.
0;it was a good game untill i got mods it crashed and i tried to fix it and all the the things rockstar brang me to was links that dont work anymore so untill theirs something we can do like reseting the game that would be perfect because i miss playing this game
0;It is pretty obvious that Take Two the made this move for shark cards. Example of PURE GREED. Oh and OpenIV cannot be used online because there are restrictions in the files. Also what do you expect us to do grind up to $8M to buy your DLC? Banning OpenIV does NOTHING and... I also received $40k money bags in online as usual!
0;No Anti Cheat system. Pay to Win game. Hackers dropping ton's $$ on players. I asked about hackers on the Rockstar Forums Instead of getting a reply I was permanently banned from the fourms. Great way to treat a person that has been such a big fan of rockstar for years. I will no longer support any Rockstar games in the future.

0;Grand Theft Auto 5 is a good game. But Rockstar &amp Take Two are completely messing it up. Only new content for online playing (GTA ONLINE) Single player is still as it was on release. Bring the new content to SP to!!!!! They removed legit modding completely from the game.At this moment. Won't buy the next title!If Rockstar would solve this things. I'm gladly to put it back to positive!Don't get me wrong. I don't like hackers and hack mods. But legit modding was awesome...
0;Yeah I joined a modded TD and I didnt know it was modded. I got leveled like 100 times with 2 kills and I got banned over it! That's They didnt do anything about the BAN either I messaged them. They just won't respond! If you're looking to buy this game for the online mode don't. Its a waste of time money and the community just sucks. A major fat one for assistance. I bet they don't have a support team just to save money. Wouldn't surprise me honestly.
0;Single Player is great fun.Online is buggy as hell. Up to the point where many of Rockstar's own missions are uncompletable for me for some unknown reason Simeon repossession missions never play the mission complete cutscene forcing me to alt+f4 the game as my character is uncontrollable. Added bonus in that I can't ask for help on Rockstar's support forums until I've owned the game for 30 days...
0;look lads im right now. let me tell you a story mans aquired gta of was all cool ez to run op pc ya get me then it broke rip in peice was very sad no way to fix so i spend $70 on steam. yes you read right i purchased this for the second time lmao. guess what!? pc cant run this fam using 750ti 15 3.3hz and 8gb ram and worse thing is im only using 1086 mb?!!?!?!? this is trash cba refund frig u steam frig u rockstar waste my money

0;GTA V is great singeplayer but honestly online. I've tried for hours days on end to do stuff like heists but every group I get just sucks. You waste so much time trying to get people for to only have morons that s everything up. Great job rockstar for yet another tier game. 1/10 would not buy again
0;Buy this game only if you love 10 min loading screens everytime you try to go into GTA Online. Seriously this game is pretty substandard for a AAA title game. If this game was a $10 game I would have closed an eye though. Until Rockstar decides to re price this game at $10 or fix their **** don't bother getting this game. Even so I've seen better $10 games out there.
0;Dont bother wasting your money for a game thats stupidly overpriced and all you will do is grind and grind and grind until your so bored of the game that you will be writing a review just like this because everything in the game is over priced and worthless because all the game is is a big fat money grab
0;Single player main story is very short.. not hard at all.. i expected more. The map issint that big either u cant enter much buildings wich i expected because thats what everyone wanted after the previous GTA games.Okay the looks are better but thats all.. the map is not bigger than san andreas wich is 10 year older or something. Expected more for the single player. Havent played multi yet
0;This game was too violent for me. I was walking around and saw two guys playing darts. I couldn't believe my eyes. That sight scarred me for life. I guess I'll just go back to playing GTA 6 where the dart playing is at a minimum. My poor virgin eyes. This game's graphics also look like doodoo ss b!tch And I want to kill myself after being exposed to the horror of dart throwing. 911/420 IGN
0;Launcher crashes every time. It's currently broken and unplayable. I've tried everything. I can't say that I'm surprised.EDIT The problem has been solved. For anyone having this problem disable the GeForce driver launch the game then enable the driver again. Despite having an easy fix it is still ridiculous that I couldn't play for a day.

0;This game sucks You can't even launch it up... like come on! ing still I try launching it tells me a file is missing or some what the I have to wait another 18 hours and I left a team with 2k subs to become a gaming channel way to go GTA you're always in anyway
0;Hackers plague the game and Rockstar does nothing about them. God moding in PvP Gamemodes and dropping cash because of the unrealistic price tags on items.Don't expect any Single player updates either because that wouldn't make as much money as shark cards ))))
0;So its been almost 2 days since the releease of the game and i still can't start the game. I contact rockstar support for help and they close my ticket and say my pc isnt up to spec even though A. It is B. I supplied them with a Dxdiag which they did not read and C. I even gave them a frecking Gpuz report to prove it.So in conclusion **** this game and rockstar. )
0;Isn't it ironic how Offline mode has not been updated at all by rockstar since the game was released yet the first update to offline mode for years is taking away the one thing about gta V that still makes the majority of the community play the game? Just a thought...I don't even play with mods on GTA but even I can acknowledge what a move it was for taketwo to ban mods. **** you taketwo you are s
0;Really bad and violent game. You can play as three diferent characters one of them is a complete psychopath.This game allows you to do whatever you want but encourages you to do crime that's why there are so many school shootings. And the women in this game are displayed like hookers that ask for the themselves
0;iest online experience Ive ever had. Especilly from a game that has been invested so much money in I expected to have at least 20 miutes of stable online play. Which even with the mount of money invvested and made on this game cant be accomplished.Being Rockstrt i'd cll the online stability flop comparable to Microsoft's miscrriage called Windows Vista.Waiting for GTA 6 for a worthy online session )
0;Banned me for a mouth and took my online guy away from me all cuzz i was enjoying there game with a SP mod tryed emailing them see if ill be getting it back two times now and i still get a bot answer not even say yes or no all that work from when it come out on the 360 then to xbox one now on here gone all over SP mod does not seam far.

Those of us who are mistaken delete the player's heart was desperate but you into the game to see see! Or plugins in groups I want to say R star! You finish eat jujube.
0;Needs fixes bad. Mouse lag is insane. I switched to using a PS4 controller for now. Weird bug where in a heist and a player dies the screen just stays on there face. A teammate must commit suicide to fix. 60FPS is possible but you have to really lower the graphics to the point of where it looks awful. Wait for some patches before you buy.
0;i have done everything they have said to work around this problem and it still doesnt work i now have 3 microsoft accounts and lost 60$ for a game that doesnt even work... i dont recomend getting it till they figure out there problem. Even then maybe not.
0;worst game in history. to much bugs. in every lobby with over 10 people in there is atleast 1 modder that's going to up your experience. they overprice everything. when u climb mount chilliad they spawn u in the middle of the mountain so u cant do if u kill urself u are just going to spawn at the same place again. But if they add real cars instead of these gay cars they have now i would be happy. )
0;The online aspect does not work for me and many other people in the forums. Rockstar expects us to take this sitting down if the game does not work for us we deserve a full $60 dollar refund no questions asked. All of this shady business practice in the online store community is unacceptable.

0;1.5 million for purchasing early is a lie..allow me to clarify if you want the FULL amount.it is a lie..you cannot get 1 million of it unless you PVP!!!!!...PVErs were only given 500k!!!!!....this is a total misrepresentation of what was to be when sold ...if developers/reps will lie this early then game isnt worth it
0;Rockstar Social club..... what junk that is... stopped me playing at launch... inexcusable I have completed the game on a ps3 and its a great title sadly at the moment the PC version is unplayable (Further update Its since been over 10 Hours from Launch and the stupid Social club has linked the wrong account to my steam client...Honestly close to going for a refund.
0;Rockstar goes on ban waves banning everyone on a server that is being griefed by modders/hackers and wonders why people get off.Customer support is non existant. Appealing the wrongful ban doesn't exist so say goodbye to your $60.Won't be purchasing another Rockstar product in the future if this is how they treat customers.
0;"""I have got to the last mission called """"The Final Score"""" and the game decided to die on me. I drive the van to the bank and at the front gate there is no cutscene entering the bank the van just stays still and doesn't move. I have filed a refund request but bet that like usual steam will deny the request because of my playtime even know there is nothing I can do to fix this issue with the game."""
0;The single player may be worth the money The online is a that will make you want to cut your wrists. If you buy this game and intend to play online either download yourself some hacks quick smart or prepare to have your game crashed by hackers constantly.

0;This game was great up until I discovered that you cannot set each character's personal vehicle. So when I buy my $100k car I can't spawn with it and when you don't drive back to your bought parking garage and park it there you will lose it forever. Even if you park it at your own ****ing house your car just disappears. I can't believe how incompetent people who make games are. This is basic stuff!
0;Worse game ever... So many issue faced... My nick got changed by rockstar and i practically begged them to change my nick... My game still hangs randomly... Seems like they make changes to your account or character without prior notice... They randomly ban people... Issues after issues... And the game is barely playable... Took them so long to release this game... Yet.. So much problems.. . I even preordered in the early part to support them but was ...
0;Rockstar is one of the worst developers when it comes to caring about their players.Everything in the game is overly expensive to get everything in last update it was around 50 million and it didn't even add much.You need to grind for so long you need to not have a life if you want to get anywhere in the online game.Overall it's a good game if you have money in it.I know many people falsely banned as well I haven't myself though. F*** you Rockstar.
0;Story mode is as normal. Online is completly broken and only there for money making to buy SHark cards. I think I walked out of my garage to be missled by other players. In team play Level 1 will be against level 200+! Completly broken! The game is fair in story mode like previoius GTA But the annoying from broken play as a cash cow for shark cards is horrid buiseness model.
0;Hey! If any Rockstar people are reading this please help! Everytime I try to join online or press ESC it freezes! I tried turning the DirectX to 12 but there is no 12 yet! And my pc runs on DirectX 12 so I dont know what to do. Please help as fast as you can please!
0;"""At the point of this review Rockstar is price gouging during the Steam Summer sale to not allow a single purchase of GTA V. They made it so you can only purchase the base game with a """"Shark Card"""" gouging the price to 80$.

0;Bought the game Spent about 13 hours downloading and installing it and nothing but problems. Can't play the game because of the Social Club/Steam linking. Apparently the key Steam gave me is already in use which is pretty stupid. All in all nothing but problems with Rockstar with any game I get from then Deffinitely a DO NOT buy. Not worth the hassle. Negative 10000 Rep
0;This game is horrible. Do not buy it. Every mission has NPCs that are impossible to kill and will NEVER miss. It was a mistake buying this game and I would likely refund it if I had the chance. Save your money frustration and time. NEVER BUY THIS GAME
0;GTA Online Instead of installing/creating a anti cheat system like Valve Anti Cheat. They hire corrupt moderators n' admins to go on their way out and ban legit players just because they picked up the hacked money weither accident or not also they don't give a about hackers. GTA 5 Singleplayer the story mode is teh best.
0;GRAD THEF AUTO 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LIKE GAME BUT DONT NNONONONONONONOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOYou play as micheal de ah and go around and blow up and then get a bunch of money for it and the cops are so lazy and stuff and they dont want to bother arrest you and do big poos in their panties then i die the end aaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!ROCKSTAR SMELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;I bought this game for PC because I wanted to use single player cheats without having to enter them every 5 minutes. Since Take2 is going after modders I have to rank this game based on the base game.Not even remotly worth the price. Stay away from thsi game.
0;My recommendation is that if you like this game and want to play it BUY THE CONSOLE VERSION This games actually filled with hackers and greifers and all the rest. I bought the game last night and played it this morning for an hour and I was met with 4 hackers Might not sound like alot but you don't get a minutes peace from these guys they're completely incapable of playing fair. Once again Don't buy this version buy the console version for peace from hackers

0;Game is dead people are scum and paying for shark cards is the only way to play Rockstar are dead to me. Also the servers take forever even longer than console on a pc.... and also default options for races are settings. Catchup and slipstream on top of custom cars makes it less about skill and more about modded accounts...
0;Don't waste your money on this game! Modding is what made this game fun but now the only way to enjoy this game is by spending stupid amounts of money! Mods offer all that was promised but never delivered but now they have killed their own game by banning all that made this game fun! DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!

How do they keep ing up I'll never know.

0;The Singleplayer is really nice... good graphics nice storyline many side quest and overall very enjoyable...But oh boy the Multiplayer...It feels like 80% of the players are in kindergarden they kill you over and over destroy your personal vehicles and up in heist.GTA Online is not playable without friends (wich i dont have C) so its basically aids on a stick

0;the game used to be fun and fair and with new over priced and super OP stuff the game has become some pay to enjoy game.each update they add some more OP stuff so those who dont have time or money will suffer in online part and it seems there are more hackers rather than normal players in game.i know if the stuff are really cheap the game will lose its main purpose but with super expensive stuff lots of players are starting to use hacks
0;Not one session I have joined in the last year has not had one or more of those people that chase you down and kill you repeatedly until you leave. You cant enter passive mode while playing with friends in a group and nothing you can say or do will get them off of you. Half the time they are modders too. Its impossible to get anything done on free roam servers but the game tries to get you to join them for more money selling cargo.
0;This game is a toxic pile of The community is abhorrent. It's close to impossible for me to actually get anywhere with the newer missions because I just get blown up during the setup stages. Everything has just descended into chaos with this game it's not very good anymore.

0;I've got half a mind about this game. The multiplayer is half baked and it's full of hackers but that's not necessarily a problem of the game itself. As a multiplayer game GTA V is really fun if you have friends but in pub games it generally tends to be a matter of frustration.As for single player it's weird because it's a definitely fun game marred by the weird gulf of features between single and multi player. But it's not that bad.
0;So I bought this game. $75 No worries I can handle that. 60GB in size okay now youre pushing me then 2 painful days of solid downloading later and I try and play online and of course. It crashes everytime every single time. Rockstar sometimes you can be an award winning game studios that take us on a magical journey and the rest of the time youre just that impatient twelve year old kid who s pies and other household appliences because he cant wait to have sex.

0;"""Great game updated weekly with new content.2016 edit 2018*I can not believe outdated this review was. GTA has turned into a sh*t show of hackers unrealistic pricing on new """"DLC"""" vehicles and no change in how to make money. 10/10 would not recommend to anyone. It is now rockstars cashcow and they plan to milk every penny they can."""
0;I bought this game when it came out for 360. I took over a week and a half before rockstar made it playible. I couldnt log in and when i finally did i lost all my progress including a lvl 43 char.YEARS later it comes out on PC and when ever i try to open the game it crashes. All i have to say is EPIC fail AGAIN rockstar. Just sell the title and let someone who knows how to make a game do it. Give up you clearly have no f'ing idea what your doing.
0;I sure wish I could play this game for more than 5 minutes with a friend. Every single time I'm playing the game aroudn 5 minutes in everyone will disappear from the derver and I will be left in my own server. I spend 7 minutes at a loading screen for less time to play in game. Sick game.
0;FU_CK THIS GAME WITH ITS BUGSS ! u get the car upgrade it put it in ur garage and u dont find it on the next log in.. u see ur old cars wich u sold long time ago... I lost minimum 200k with these bugs without taking into consideration wasted time.. those insanly long loading screens... problems with joining with your crew members to the same server... and so on and on and on.. AND U FU_CKERS SELL GAME FOR 60 EUR WHILE THIS GAME IS IN BETA STAGE !!! FU !!!
0;One of the best games I have ever played to bad it has to be hosted on some of the worst servers i have ever experienced(online part that is). 9/10 times i play this game for 1 hour then log off to avoid getting off by the constant connection issues or the lack of competent players after waiting 30 mins for a heist group.So sad to say this is NOT a fun experience unless you have friends to play with! But with the right friends u will have a blast!
0;"""I have had this game for a week now and after atleast 20 phone calls to Rockstar support and hours of trying their """"solutions"""" my online hasn't worked at all. I literally bought the game just for the online and I can't play it. It amazes me that Rockstar took 2 years to put this game out and it doesn't work. 10/10Glad I paid 60 dollars for a game I can't play."""
0;Running the game on my old rig keeps crashing / hanging with no BSODs. Just BAM frozen. I'm above the min specs but this is ridiculous. Game rocks. PC version is buggy as Never had a game wreak this much havok. I even installed the special GTA V nVidia drivers. Loading times are absolutely hellish even on my friend's higher end rigs. Trying to play Online gets me kicked because whenever I try to adjust settings it keeps saying I'm idle for too long. If your rig is don't even try seriously.
0;single player is fun multiplayer is like wow but somehow even more grindy and little to no reward but a shiny car. not to mention the waves upon waves of hackers who light your character on fire and kick you from the gamei mean the combat is good thats all.please dont give rockstar your money they dont deserve it.
0;"""My main issue involves game not launching and recieveing the """"exited unexpectedly"""" message. I have troubled shooted countless hourse trying to fix this game myself. Ever since the release i have submitted mutliple trouble tickets and not one of them have been replied to.Again this is a failure on both rockstar and steam to provide quality game play to its consumers."""
0;Worst customer service in the world just do not buy from them anymore STEAM is very bad to their costumers no wonder everybody is playing with EPIC games got a problem with my GTA V cant play the game for more than 3 month bought it from steam they telling me to contact rockstar games .gfetting a masseg once im trying to get in this steam account is conected to a diffrent social club account . its not true its my personal account .
0;I hate to write this but....cheaters / modders or whatever... spoil all the goods things at the roots for online experience... Even if you think or someone says that it's not so bad...it is...and there is no way to fix that...sadly...very dissapointing... As much as I want to love this game...I cant...So if you want to play it online buy it on PS4...
0;Great game except all of these ridiculous flying motorcycles and cars that shoot homing missles. I can't stand this stuff I'm doing a mission in a tanka nd someone flys over adn shoots one homing missle at me and my Rhino blows up mission over. Great. Just great. What a fair game when other players can just obliterate you like this.
0;Way too many hackers roaming around freely with nothing better to do then shoot money all around kill every player on sight and spawn tons of and crash your game..Also loading screens are f***ing atrocious.although the singleplayer is fun and multiplayer heist are a great way to pass your time with friends.so overall get it on sale (as long as Rockstar will actually put it on sale and won't try to scam us next time)
0;Needs a map expansion. I cannot believe nothing has been released after all these years. I just cant believe they truly waited to GTA 6 to give us a bigger world. Just feel a little let down. old review Way to go Rockstar!!! GTA V is a masterpiece. Waiting for one world to connect all there cities...Being able to drive around from city to city like in the Crew...That boys and girls would be how Grand Theft Auto becomes the 8th Wonder of the world!!! Cant wait for GTA 6
0;Good in terms of content but as per usual the mentally defective tards who run the game can't be bothered to keep hackers from having free reign of the online servers giving them license to go so far as to close your game or kick you from matches at will.
0;Game is full of garbage game mechanics like unskippable cut scenes and terrible online multiplayer. You have to go online if you want to have access to certain jobs. Takes forever to connect online even if you have a beast of a Rig bc you have to connect with every person currently in an online session. You are forced to connect online bc you cannot right from the opening menus make your own online session. Nothing but garbage loading screens all fing day with this game.
0;"""Tried to go back to playing the game after a year just wanted to play single player campaign mode and it wouldn't load because of a """"social club error"""". So I reinstalled the game and it still doesn't work and I get the same error. i've been dealing with this for the last two days. I've given rockstar hundreds of dollars in my life and this is how they repay me? By taking away a product I payed for without any warning? We should file a class action lawsuit. I would sign up."""
0;Mod the game a lot better than the countless hours of grind you don't need to go through just to get the basic materials needed for a base and then the millions adding on to it not including all the upgrades and the ridiculously expensive cars reaching almost 3 million.
0;"""Take two easily one of the worse game """"developing"""" companies I have ever made the unfortunate mistake of paying money for a game to. EDIT Now that Take Two has hopefully learned their lesson I can give the game a good review again. EDIT Rockstar is now banning legitimate players who are not hacking or modding. And they refuse to do anything about the ban waves that ban actuall players. Avoid this unless you are going to use FiveM or only play the completely unupdated singleplayer."""
0;"""1 Awsome game everybody has to agree with this one . 2 I'm not gonna say """"Don't buy it""""BuT3 Game cost to much like for real man 60 euros .

0;Played great for a while an amazing PC port when you can get it up and running. Unforantley a game breaking bug exists within Rockstars Social Launcher that you have to have open while you play GTA Launcher just Wont boot up in windows and will crash after about 3 seconds. Its amazing to see my 60 bucks get wasted so much but it seems like this problems been around for a while and rockstar either has no idea how to fix it or since they already got your money they dont care.
0;my social club was linked to steam and it gor rid of my log in info and i cant log in on gta when contacting them about this they completly ignore it and dont help u with it they only send things to log in and change your password when u cant log in to that
0;"""Removes all my cash on day of release of fun looking dlc (from 250M to 20K)""""fine I'll play single player with mods"""" Sends cease and desist to OpenIV team...K I'll just play something else. Rockstar has lost their way among the piles of money they get from Shark cards. I just wanna have fun and Rockstar seems hellbent on preventing that from happening."""
0;Worst online gaming experince i have ever had does not work its slow the loading screens are un godly and the player base are full of trolls and s the single player i got stuck as franklin not able to do anything and that was my breaking point. GTA5 is a waste of money do not buy it stick to your other games
0;The game is good and entertaining but the online is very bad. People constantly getting banned for no apparent reason. When you contact Rockstar support they don't even tell you why you are banned. I would not recomend this game for anyone that is wishing to play GTV online.
0;rockstar/take2 clearly hate their customers (pc release delay for years as one of examples) and have now declared open war to customers and forbid even singleplayer mods and harass volunteer mod creators with cease and desist letters.no more money from me to rockstar or take2 until they restrain their corporate greed and publicly apologize. threatening legal action against volunteer community is the worst they could have ever done. even EA would not steep so low.
0;"""So because paying for this game multiple times wasn't enough money for them they decided to take away my mods. IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE! This is simply an attempt to push us into multiplayer mode (where they actually bothered to add stuff unlike single player) where it is basicly built around micro transactions. My favorite quote for the online game """"Micro transation laden hell hole"""" N3."""
0;HORRIBLE network issues for GTA Online Performing Heist tasks are impossible due to ploayers constantly dropping out of the session.Would not reccommend if you want to play onlineSingle Player experience is stable and has a very enjoyable character switching feature.
0;STOP UPDATING AND BREAKING THIS GAME YOU GREEDY MONGOLOIDS ALL YOU ARE DOING IS BREAKING THE OFFLINE PLAY.NO ONE BUT HACKERS PLAY ONLINEYOU BAN PPL FOR BEING IN A GAME THAT A HACKER JOINSI AM SOO GLAD I PURCHASED THIS STEAMING TURD WITH PROMO BUCKS AND NOT REAL LIFE SPENDY FOLDY MONEY
0;The overall design of the game or a good personal feeling good play a lot especially OL mode gives the player more play options personally feel that the only drawback is that the log OL model is not very stable often appear offline mode but also unable to connect! A lot of players have also appeared in this situation do not know is the server slag R star or because the network causes!
0;"""Dont ever """"EVER"""" buy this game if you are going to play it online. Your games will be full of invincible cars and people that is if you dont start combusting randomly or start ejecting water from your head. You cant even report these hackers because they will kill you so fast that you cant even open report menu. All the while innocent people will get banned beacuse of these hackers while the true culprits get away. If you love your sanity just go play something else just leave run..."""
0;Was a cool game until the money hungry developers took away single player mod tools and removed 10 mil of my legit money. Grind for 30 hours to have enough money to buy the new stuff in the next update or pay $120 to get $16 20 mil and buy everything in one update rinse and repeat.
0;Hire the modders pay them to make the single player content you REFUSE to create. Don't think about it as a bad thing that your fans are creative. Help them. You are lucky and yet you ignore and now actively attack your community. That is just sad. We all know you should be better. Please make good going forward. We don't want you to become heartless like EA.
0;Ok so i gave GTAV a really good review and decided i was wrong!GTA has the potential to be the best game ever! Loads to do online and lots being added BUT...........cant play online without coming across hackers. Would ask for refund if i hadn't played single player!ROCKSTAR SORT YOUR OUT AND GET RID OF THE HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;One of my favorite games. But Rockstar has removed what made this game great. With no mods this game stays bland and boring after so long of playing. Mods were what made this game interesting for me and now theyre gone. Im pretty and have uninstalled. i might come back if mod support returns. This is complete t Rockstar...
0;Do you like GTA online but hate microtransactions and repetitive low paying missions?? gtaforcehax . com for only $7 can get you all the money you need! Why spend $10 for 500k in game when you can spend $7 on unlimited money. P.S. Take Two. RIP OpenIV.
0;Bought this game and played the crap out of it. When I got my fill of the rather interesting single player campaign I tried the less than stellar grindhouse hell hole that is the online multyplayer. shortly after that I resorted to mods so that I could enjoy the beautiful open world. Now take two has taken away the only enjoyable thing from this for me. One of the best selling games of all time ruined by petty greed. I guess it's time to let this game die.
0;Ugh what can I say take 2 has messed up so many times delaying the PC version for a year taking off countless mods and multiplayer content I gave them a second chance and bought the PC version when it came out but now with them closing down the open IV team I know that I will not be buying the next GTA there is no point to GTA without the mods.
0;Loading screen...I need more loading screen ....10/10 best Ban Simulator... you pay them 60 dollars cant have anything online cozz of prices and after some time they just ban you for not buying sharkcards ( i mean why would you use online space if you arent making them more money) But they forget one thing.. PC MASTER RACE REVENGE https //www.youtube.com/watch?v ub99VMrG0WQ
0;the story is probly one of the best single player games i have ever played. online used to be good to.but inocent players are being banned for no reason its become pay to win and modders just get worse everytime they try to fix it. going back to the play to win thing what is the end goal of online anyways so far its just aquire curency and get cars.
0;I waited three days for this game to download and when it finally downloaded i was very excited to play to only find out after the first few seconds the game in story mode would crash and i was not able to see anything only sound all i would see is shapes and sounds. im very dissapointed I might have to get a refund if i dont find out how to fix soon....
0;Too much of a grind everything in the game is so damn expensive. They're trying to influence people to buy shark cards just so they can steal more money from us. I do not recommend this game anymore so I'll give Rockstar and Take Two interactive a royal you.
0;The gameplay in single player is good especially with PC having mods over the console version. The multiplayer is meeehh and Rockstar(2k) trying to milk its customers' of money through DLC is just ridiculous. I completely disagree them trying to remove the modding community (Ala getting rid of OpenIV tool) because I think it is one of the defining features of the game. Not recommending it if this continues.
0;one of the most awful games because they are trying to take all ur moneythey remove openiv just cause they want you to play the despicably HORRIBLE online filled with awful people that hate u hackers and pay to win. i only bought this game to play mods now that i cant whats the ing point.
0;Online is garbage.Every session you join is guarenteed a modder. You go in passive mode to hide from modders? Goodluck with that. Oh the best part of the game is getting calls from lester/tony/etc. while you pvp! Trying to snipe? *phone call* you zoom out to answer the phone . Seriously? Rockstar needs to get their together and not just think about how to bankrupt players in order to buy more sharkcards .
0;Used to be good if you could get a session without a hacker. Game has become a money grab and the developers and Take Two have no shame in telling us they only care about our money. They also ed the modding community one of the only communities that was keeping their game alive. Don't support them by buying this game. If you already own it don't buy any shark cards. They did this to themselves.
0;The ONLY reason this game exists is because we stood up and defended them from congress and law. Now this same company has stabbed us all in the back and used/abused the law to attack the very people that made them what they are.Deleted from all five Steam accounts in my house hold and Xbox and PS4 versions deleted as well.
0;This game can be tons of fun but is ruined by how much of a cash grab it's become. I could recommend it for the singleplayer (storymode) alone which is well made well voice acted and offers plenty of content. The online mode is frequently updated and is fun in its own right. It's a good game ruined by a company that tries to squeeze money out of you for Shark Cards.
0;before you buy this game I suggest check out the forums to see how the system lock out the innocent people's account but let the cheater keeps playing. the best record they have done is lock out a people who just touched the game for only 2 hours without doing anything and got locked. good luck if you want to buy this game
0;I recently upgraded my graphics cards and wanted to have a try on GTA online after a couple of months. But starting in the first mission i got ejected from my car while i was driving fast and then some *** shot me 4 times as soon as i respawn. There are cheaters everywhere and i don't know how can they enjoy this. If rock star doesn't care to fix cheating then this great game is going to waste.
0;I do enjoy playing the Story mode far more than Multiplayer mainly due to the extremely horrible player base I keep getting paired with... Haven't managed to find a decent lobby that isn't either empty or full of people going around killing stuff and ignoring the goals... I'll just stick to wandering around Story and making up things to do since they never bother adding very much new except for the online cash cow mode...
0;Here's a Rhyme Take Two F*** You!Cant stop the Mod's Wont Stop the Mods and now you cant take back what you done ALSO If your going to send a legal document planing on sueing someone SPELL CHECK IT! Take Two your aslmost as bad a Konami!#GTAMODS4LIFE#FUTAKE2
0;Repeatedly asked STEAM for help about the error code ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT with no sucess. I have enough time to maybe do a run for my Club or a Hangar mission before I crash. I can't play the game anymore either. I can't pvp I can't do just about anything without crashing. I have deleted and reinstalled like 10 times &amp I have to always play in safe mode in direct X 10.1. Sometimes I have days where I crash with in the first 1 5 mins over and over again.
0;I tried to like this game. The single player is every bit as good as the equivalent version of this game. But the multiplayer is literally atrocious. Scammers spammers and hackers litter the game. It's no longer fun. Rockstar continues to add features. It's funny becasue the basic premise of the game is no longer viable. Even EA does a better job of hacker protection.
0;Modders will always win. Take two is trying to get rid of them so players dont get drops from modders and are more inclined to buy shark cards. Ive put in 2 years of grind and only recently started modding up until i got banned. Sure it was satisfying to finally be able to buy something after grinding for cash but the most fun ive had was when i was modding.
0;My account was hacked along with many other peoples accounts and i have no been able to play since i can no longer log into social club (someone changed my email and password) and Rockstar has been pretty mute about the whole subject up to this point. So far i had around 3 days to play and the person who stole my account has had about a week to play... i pretty much just paid Steam and Rockstar $60 to make my hard drive 60 70GB smaller...
0;Good game and there s not too much wrong with it but it s a negative review because of the fact that all online sessions are infested with modders anyone who plays from scratch without buying or cheating in money is as good as dead as everyone will have tha mass weapons
0;This is a great game but GTA online is a slow tedious grindfest. Since Take Two torpedoed mods there is no replay value for the game. The campaign and gameplay is great but with a broken multiplayer and decreased freedom it is not worth the full price anymore.
0;Whenever I use this game with a youtube video open in the steam browser and tab back in during a cutscene my game won't register my keyboard and mouse inputs and I have to restart the game. /strike Valve /strike Rockstar please fix.Also there are modders who can set your car on fire instantaneously the moment they join ruining your source vehicle missions. Get an anticheat or a better one if it exists
0;story is okay.online is a cash grab only mommys boys shark card spastics still play and buy massive amounts of ingame cash with moms credit card so they can buy a tank and drive around like loners mindlessly killing players while jacking themselves off.
0;Such a shame that instead of working towards making GTAO better and dealing with hackers (and thus bringing alot of players back that have long since given up on the GTAO experience) efforts are put in place to spite those having thier own fun offline. To think that Rockstar and co. always seemed like such a progressive company.
0;trash trash trash there're tons of error occur every single day even im playing with i7 gtx 1080ti and decent connection but still suddenly rockstar will kick u out of the game with 'there are too many request from ur ip address try again later code.8000' or 'saving fail' but foremost u cant login again for hours when ur kicked out and rockstar wont response for it its really annoying so i dont recommend it anyway
0;After about two weeks of playing I hopped on one day to find that GTA 5 uninstalled itself. Very disappointing because I had to download this game non stop for 7 days.. I would not like to repeat this again and I think Ill call it quits here also it seems as if the developers don't care about fixing problems in the games only money. The game is fun not I would not recommend it.
0;No game can be positively endorsed that breaks down on a modding community which actually brings said game a lot of popularity and sales. It is highly negative for the game and for the name of the publisher to chose this option rather than intelligently cooperating with modders and solving any issues that might arise in relation to modding tools.
0;Rockstar are a backwards corrupt development team who should have been taken to court 7 times over. Avoid buying at all costs GTA V is a good game but every business practice committed by rockstar should have been made illegal at the dawn of the internet.
0;Bought the game a couple months ago and had lots of fun playing with my friends. Until I got hit with the most recent ban wave. Don't buy this game. I lost 100+ hours of my time for something I didn't even do. Rockstar won't even admit that they messed up.
0;The single player is great however the online is built to make you buy sharkcards (in game money micro transaction). Everything in the online is expansive and while you can have fun without buying a sharkcard you won't be able to enjoy all the features and to make matters worse they are now attacking single player mod developers.
0;No singleplayer expansion content every update that R* out goes to the online portion and said updates break mods for a few days. Downgrading also crashes the game for me.It's still fun as a singleplayer game I just hate that I cannot play it due to my mods not working everytime they update.And them for the OpenIV incident.
0;During the first days after pc release this game was great and im talking about performance as for the online and story i think its good 9/10 but performance... Damn everyday that passes i lose more and more fps all of this started after the first patch thank you rockstar...
0;OpenIV and the connected modding scene are part of what made this game so wonderful. With take 2 interactive putting a cease and desist on what has been the platform for most GTA mods for the past ten years so much of the game is lost and with that don't bother buying
0;cringy to log in and get 5 different calls from NPC's every time over absolute dog scheisser that you 100% cannot disable no matter whatimagine how good the game could have beenT2 have destroyed GTA I love Rockstar but I have little hope for their future titles
0;this game suffers alot of problems. modders and in game problems are cheif among them.do not get this game if you get it you will enjoy it and find it quite addictive. and then you'll get struck by errors and glitches that are supposedly 'not natural' or just have 'bad luck'. and you'll feel the way i feel nowi myself had roughly $45768 of in game currency and after the game crashed and i reloaded i now only have $4658.HOURS AND HOUS OF GAMEPLAY GONE THANKS FOR NOTHING ROCKSTAR!
0;"""i tot it was gonna be a fun game till i hit a dog with my car on first person and i felt badapparently i almost got myself banned from modding and i would advice everyone to made a petition for modding on gta 5 ! i will put this game """"not recommended"""" for now till they change their mind and notice how low online population is right now"""
0;game could be best game of all time but unfortunatly with all the crashinmg and bugs i cannot recomend this game at the time currently after playing the game for over two weeks with frequant crashes and glitches i am unable to play this game anymore it fails to load storymode no fixes the patch did not fix this i am very disappointed after this long wait and all the money i paid i get a disfunctional game that i cannot enjoy.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! noit until they come up with a fix
0;I'm here to add my voice to the outrage expressed at Take Two Interactive's recent actions toward the modding community. Before buying this game please be aware that until Take two retract their cease and desist statement all Gta mods you may be familiar with will not work. I will also state that until this violation of basic decency toward Gta s playerbase has been addressed anyone unfamiliar with the debacle should spend their money elsewhere.
0;"""R* and Take Two promised single player dlc like 3 years ago. That never happened. At least we can mod right? Well not anymore. They support GTA online but who cares not everyone wants to play with a bunch of 12 year olds just wreaking havoc and failing heists. I wish I could get a refund due to empty promises. Its sad but R* and take two are now on the """"do not buy"""" list. And they should be on yours too.gameplay mehreplayability noneonline who cares"""

0;I can t enjoy GTA 5 (online) nearly as much as I used to because I've gotten to a point where everything I want cost too much money and Rockstar made it that way to sell use their stupid Shark Cards but I'm not going to be their cash cow so I bid GTA 5 farewell.
0;I have NOT been banned (yet?) but there are way too many people being banned on this game for absolutely no reason. I feel like instead of finding ways to ban the hackers bans are just a random coin flip for everyone. Right now this is a very poor choice of game to buy as you have severe risk of losing it all.

0;gta would be a good game. its got the content alright but these bastards expect you to throw away so many hours of your life to get the good things. You literally have to grind for ages to properly grind in the first place. and then grind for ages more to finally get the stuff you want. people have ing lives. cant spend countless hundreds of hours in this game.
0;This review isn't about gameplay so if you're curious about that stop reading now. My issue was that it didn't work on my computer. Had issues connecting to the social club. After a few hours of waiting for it to download it's 63GB I decided that I should refund it and buy a working game. It does look amazing if you manage to get it to work but I just couldn't.
0;The game would be 100% perfect if it wasn't OVERWHELEMED by modders who blow you up in every lobby you enter. No need to buy shark cards since any modder will give you MILLIONS which kills the economy. Game is fun but the modding kills it. Rockstar does absolutely nothing to stop it.
0;The game has a good story line and there is lots of modding opportunities for Single Player such as LSPDFR. The downside is that the online mode is not worth it and there is no continuation of the story line after you have performed the final heist. I would like to see a way where you can perform heists after the story or even DLC to continue it. Good singleplayer bad multiplayer.//update TakeTwo violating the rights of PC gamers have made the game completely useless. Boycott Rockstar. xo
0;"""The game is nothing but a grind at this stage. Used to love this game it used to be so weird (in a good way) witty and diverse but now there is just countless of these supposedly """"free dlcs"""" being added to online that you have to spend hundreds of dollars to even get some of the new things or grind for hours on end it's ridiculous. Can't Rockstar have fun like they used to instead of milking my for my money?"""
0;I want to play this game but I can't even download it again.I've already downloaded and installed this game 2 3 times. Each time 11 or more gb of data was either corrupt in the download or just missing. It seems to be a hit miss thing with people. My roommate installed through steam and is playing just fine. Until this game is fixed don't buy it.
0;honestly even after the time i put into GTA i really cant recommend it rockstar support is a joke and some player who havent done anything wrong get banned for no apearant reason while actual hackers and modders are allowed to run free and spawn in your house.
0;This whole OpenIV shutdown is Take Two Interactive/Rockstar's fault for not preventing mods ONLINE. Take Two and Rockstar has NO ONE to blame but THEMSELVES. Modding is what keeps this game popular. Without mods this game would get boring as f**k after replaying the story over and over and doing the same thing evertime.F**K YOU TAKE TWO AND ROCKSTAR!
0;The game is out since 2013. Alot of updates for Multiplayer. Alot of clickbait video's on Youtube about Gta 6. Alot of toxic/weird people on multiplayer. Alot of useless boring mods in singleplayer. Basicly back in 2013 2015 it was fun but i just dont see how i can have fun starting this game up.
0;Single player is fun enough if a tad samey the multiplayer however... It's just bad. You basically have to buy shark cards to get anywhere anymore because prices are so inflated. You can get one shot by some 12 year old that stole mommy's credit card and bought an effectively invincible vehicle and there are so many hackers that there truly is no point even trying to play for real anymore.Don't go anywhere near the multiplayer no matter how many friends you have. It's just not worth it.
0;it is good i love playing it with my friends but when try to play online public you will enter the dark side it is full of griefers and ppl who really dont have a life and just wanna make kill your self it is hell in there and worst is that if you wanna do any thing you gotta be in public online i hate this game for that and it is filled to the brim with micro transactions what happend to the old good rockstar
0;"""Every change i've seen on GTA O made me switch from a positive review to a negative one.With over 3000 hours on record Rockstar banned me. I joined a random heist got in their car they teleport. I submit a ticket under """"I dont want to get banned"""" category on the Rockstar support website explaining what happened. They next day they suspend my account for 30 days and reset everything."""
0;Story is fun but online is controlled by modders. Makes the game sometimes unfun and sometimes everyone starts reporting everyone. So you'll see reports on you just because your in the session and no one knows who the modder is. After all these years rockstar still hasnt fixed this issue. Do not spend a penny on this game just go buy a cheap copy from gamestop or something play the campaign and trash it.
0;I used to play this game a lot played the story mode 4 times. I started online and enjoyed playing for a while I experienced modders which lead to me being temp banned a week later after I got unbanned I assumed all the modifications to my account were reverted but when I connected online I played for a about 10 mins and was met with a ban message this time permanent for the same reason. (Modifications were Major Level / Money Increase Most things insta unlocked etc.
0;"""I like how I got banned for modding on my main account and then on my second account I have given myself hundreds of millions of ingame dollars and never ever ever ever ever ever got banned because the ban system is """"flawless"""" according to Rockstar. Sucks for the people who have the patience to play this game legit and get banned for it."""
0;How 2 GTA Online1. Make character and finish tutorial2. Go search up gta recovery servers3. Join a group and buy a recovery of your choice4. Go back to GTA online and play with $$$ in your bank5. Sit back and spend all your money on things you will never be able to buy without grinding forever
0;While I like the game the online play is attrocious. There are cheaters all over the place. Technologically it is a very advanced game. Play the game for the single player version and not the online version. I bought it for the online game play and I cannot recommend it.
0;Thankfully modding is back and Take Two said they're sorry. That's nice but uninstalling the game freed up like 75 gigs on my harddrive so I think I'm not gonna reinstall it. Singleplayer has gotten boring and the online isn't fun. So this review is still negative.At least now I can finally play KSP and not feel guilty about it.
0;Story mode is a 10/10. but online is another Issue. This game has been dying for a while and instead of leaving it alone Rockstar continues to try and make money off of it. The only time I enjoyed it is when I played around with mods but now I've been banned so it's a thumbs down and a uninstall from me 2/10 good story modeGreedy company
0;This loading screen has wasted me an eternity of lifetime. You either sent me to online or tell me something went wrong and sent me back why in the hell do you have to stuck me in the clouds and let me rot away like a fa hking corpse died of waiting! Phoque You Rockstar!
0;To buy this you must first buy this and to buy that you must first buy this but first you must buy this then buy this then that then this and then drop 1.5 mil on the floor then buy that then drive 500 miles then fly under 10 bridges then buy 20 sharks cards then wire us 10 000 USD AND THEN you can get your first car. Easy.Only fun with friends. P2W.
0;"""Removed my negative review because they fixed steam controller but now I can't even log in. It's making me fill out captchas that are literally impossible to finish. Then I can't remember """"rockstar social club"""" email. Can't even play the game anymore. Remove this terrible bs"""
0;"""This game used to be awesome I pretty much only play GTA online and now its so full of hackers and cheaters that every person who you try to shoot at will likely glitch you into oblivion and crash your game... Theres no more of the cool """"Here have 20 mil"""" hackers Rockstar got rid of all those horrible demons they couldn't give less of a about all the people who exploit the out of the game teleporting around and flying through the air spawning cars on people.."""
0;"""There is a problem with this game where it freezes randomly. I would not recommend it because Rockstar's only response is """"update your graphics card."""" Lol if it's already up to date then what? They're just blowing smoke because they don't know what the problem is."""
0;Do yourself a favor and boycott Take Two. Chances are you are reading reviews now because you saw somewhere about the C&amp D of OpenIV. It as im sure you are aware of is a very anti consumer practice. I cant in anyway see a stading reason for its removal Nor can I see a reason to support this decision in any positive light.
0;After owning this game on xbox 360 as well as ps4 as well as pc Rockstar and Take Two has made me not a fan of their game anymore. The game has grown stale despite the extremely stupid updates and so I've taken to adding some mods for personal play to make the game better. But after what the company did I highly doubt that I will purchase their next GTA game (which will probably be in 10 years since these s are slow as to actually release anything in a timely manner)
0;Oh Hey See You Like modding Our Game Would Be A Shame if We uhh Took That Down.......and thats exactly what were gonna do Rockstar..and Take Two You Dumbass Comapny i unistalled GTA because i didnt wanna get Perma Banned For Modding But I Recently Wanted to Reinstall For Modding But then i find out mid install You Cant mod The Game...YOU'VE KILLED YOUR GAME! 0/10https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv Sign Here To Get mods Back..Maybe
0;Nothing like loading up story mode and getting hurled into a never ending loadscreen for an online lobby. This game used to be fun but anything fun that doesn't generate revinue for R* seems to be patched out.EDIT 6/16/17 Looks like Take Two has sent a C&amp D to OpenIV effectively removing the ability to safely mod singleplayer. Thanks T2
0;The game isn't that good without mods and they have killed those.They have attacked the modding comunity for reasons they will not explicitly state ( * They want more money being my best bet * ) and have thrown a nail or two into their coffins.As of this moment i will only purchase rockstar games when discounted 60% or more.
0;Take Two has spat in the face of an enormous part of the GTA community whose goodwill has been built up over the last decade. The destruction of the modding community and the increasing necessity of microtransactions to keep up with the game has become too much to bear. Don't buy this game.
0;Take Two Interactive has falsely accused the developers of OpenIV of facilitating hack tools and cheats that interfere with GTA Online. Without even considering the reality of the situation the sicced their lawyers on the developers causing the end of one of the greatest mod tools this game has ever seen.I cannot in good conscience support a company this aggressively anti consumer.
0;Welp At the moment Take Two Interactive have gave Open Iv a modding tool box a cease and desist to stop any work on the mod or even haveing it available claming it is used for people looking to exsplot the game this is simplely lieing.Its a scum thing to do &amp were all waiting to see what the real reason was for doing this.
0;Normally I can't recommend this game enough but since the publisher's decision to gernade mods and modders... well it simply doesn't work anymore. I woulc call Take Two a flaming box of scrotums but that's being too kind for ruining one of my favorite games of the last 10 years.
0;To tell the truth I have a book but now can be said not to play this game.50% of the game time I was staring at the city's haze. 45% of the time I was staring at the multiplayer game. 4% of the time I was watching a slide show.Real game time is only 1%.All of the experience of a multiplayer game.So I'm going to give a bad review and when I'm going to fix the server I'll think about it.
0;You went from having hundreds of dollars in your wallet to having nothing. Now you are rich on a game full of rocket launchers and kids who screams in your headphones. Poof! Your money is gone too and you can only sell your cars for half the price. Your planes and yacht can't be selled. Rockstar give you one option... BUY MORE SHARK CARDS!!
0;So take two just banned modding for a game that was probably only still alive and kicking for the mods being released... I cannot fathom the stupidity and rash actions taken by take two and will no longer support a company that attacks its own (thriving) community and fanbase. Without mods this game is pretty much dead on the PC platform
0;It is unjust to blatantly just take down a modding tool and ruin a subcommunity as a whole just because it allowed for some people to cheat even though the primary source of cheaters used trainers which didn't use OpenIV. It is entirely unfair to punish everyone for the actions of others. Killing a modding community is something I find entirely horrible. I liked Rockstar before for continuing to produce content now I'm unsure that I can place my trust in them again in the future.
0;The game is pay to win. You have level 8000 modders running around multiplayer who have more money than rank. Rockstar reset my account after one of said modders gave me tons of money. Now I am stuck on low level fighting attack helicopters. Game is complete garbage. Not buying any other rockstar games EVER!
0;GTA Online bans you if you play by the rules but you get a free pass if you're a hacker. Unfortunately online mode is a lot less fun when you're playing in a closed single player session with no mods but hey that's the price you pay if you don't want to get instantly banned.
0;Good Game but the Ram 4GB and VGA 2GB its still lag but this is cool game and FPS so good Thx Steam and Social ClubROKSTAR LAIK PEPEK U KNOW ? IS LIK BAPAK DIEUU ANJING PULA KONTOL PEPEK JEMBUTBAPAK DIEU KALAU PUNYA KONTOL GUNAKAN DENGAN BAIK JANGAN KAYAK BAPAK DIEU ANJING
0;Online reminds me of an MMO with a lot of grind for new content (but you can pay with your real money for virtual $$$). Updates are pretty much the same with similar missions and mechanics.Also optimization is bad (freezes and lags even on good computers). Online takes years to load and there is a lot of cheaters. R* doesn't care about players they just want the monies. Single Player is nice tho.
0;This game was awesome when I played on Ps4 2 years ago but now I decided to play it on Pc and Oh my god it's awful nearly all the lobbies are either full trollers that won't let you do anything or modders that will shower u with money drops or r invencible . This game was better and I realy enjoyed it but now it's a pieace of sh**
0;"""Made by a money grabbing company who doesnt care for it's comminity.Take 2 issuing a Cease and Desist notice to the makers of the well known modding comminity beind OpenIV to """"help tackle ingame cheating"""" yeah right!Used to love this game now after this well I dont want to recommend anything made bya company that will wrongfully ban innocent players with no appeal system.TL DR Rockstar Says You To CommunityAnd FYI no ive not been banned"""
0;Rockstar and Take Two killed all of the awesome modders' and youtubers' community by shuting down OpenIV. Don't support them until they fix this problemFor those who want to continue modding enhancing the SP or seeing new and enhanced content from LSPDFR youtubers go to this link https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv?recruiter 734313824&amp utm_source share_petition&amp utm_medium copylink&amp utm_campaign share_petition&amp utm_term wj_welcome_email_v2.2_q1
0;I'm not happy with Gta 5. I can't play offline. too play offline you need to be online. so how's that work?. I like playing single player. I don't know why I have to be online to play single player. Rockstar must be stupid or hiring stupid people. I hope they learn from their mistakes. because I'm thinking about Grand Theft Auto 6. I don't know if I will buy it or not.
0;Please Rocstar fix your game. This day I come to play the game and I noticed 2 of my cars was randomly dissappeared in online mode. Then I went help my friend to do some heists.. Where is chopter man who will pick us up were just flying little cirkle and didn't pick us up we tried it 4 times.. This game is full of bugs and rockstar is focusing to fix exploits first.. don't buy this game not worth 60
0;Rock* bans you online for modding single player money. Well last time I buy a game from this scummy company. Have had a ticket open on their website for a week now and they still haven't responded to tell me the duration because that's not information we need to know or anything. Let me just sit through the 10 minute loading screen each day to check. Scummy company. Would recommend this game but would NOT recommend paying for it.
0;"""Great. Got banned. Seems like Rockstar is being very idiotic. Many people are getting banned for doing nothing or using simple FOV mods. People are even getting banned for """"cheating"""" in singleplayer. If that tweet I saw by Rockstar calling their consumers """"dumbasses"""" is real which I hope it is not then they are insanely stupid arrogant s."""
0;I have been playing this game on and off since the summer of 2016. I have played the storymode countless times. However if your buying this game for online dont do it. Online mode is just a cash grab. Yes you do have fun from time to time but if you dont spend money its just hours and hours of unfun grinding. Doing the heists are impossible if you dont have friends.
0;Stupid why not let mods on singleplayer. Mods are the only thing that makes people want to play that game anymore. everything you come with is the same nothing mew. oh wait you add ROCKET bikes?!? like who is interested in that except people who has never played a game EVER. Ridiculous
0;this game has gone to you literally need a mod menu to have fun in this game now not only are they pushing micro transactions but the game is bugged all to hell and the community is just god awful this review wont help anyone but i just want the rating to go down a tiny bit lol
0;Still have yet to play this game due to gta launcher crashes. Disabled antivirus reinstalled etc. nothing has worked. Some people have got past it by disabling their gpu but my motherboard doesn't have an onboard chip so that isn't really an option..oh well it's Rockstar's duty to make the game load right anyhow. No problem out of any other game I own.
0;Cant stand online as it's grindy because prices are so high so people buy sharkcards. I understand blocking online modding but attacking offline mods does nothing but ruin it and make people mad. I only play offline and now one of the biggest selling points of GTAV has been taken away.
0;buy only if you're interested playing the story mode.online is utterly cheaters every session and if you play more than 30 mins sometimes it will disconnect you from the session. community is more cancer than lol and dota combined devs dont really care since they made enough money. they will ban legit players. say hacker drops me some money they will ban me not the hacker and lets not forget about the fact.
0;Retured to this game to play with the mods i guess that not happening anymore.Old ReviewGreat game as it always has been currently the only issues I have with it are in GTA Online the loading times are terrible and if a player disconnects from a heist all your crew is kicked to freeroam which sucks if your right at the end of a heist.
0;Transaction failed because Rockstar services received too many requests from my game? What the hell is that bllsht? Do you want me to buy your shttie Shark Cards? You Rockstar guys are the mtherfkcing worst. Burn in hell along with all your greedy pile of crap.
0;the game is full of long reloads an being kicked from server. sucks spend most of my time loading . it all so has a tendency to put you on a server by your self. been me off. couple that with the playing that keep leaveing missions makes the loading even longer. so if you enjoy being screwd after you have spen a good chunk on change yes please buy this game
0;UPDATE! THEY REMOVED THE SUPPORT FOR MODDING. NOT COOL!So I have been playing for a couple of hours and I can only say this. The console versions was beta tests for the pc version. This game is gourgios works perfectly performance wise and only takes a few tweeks to make the fps view mode work perfectly!If you liked san andreas and have not played a gta game since then this should be your next gta game )
0;Rockstar Take two interactive on behalf of the PC MOD community You are not dealing with console kids You are dealing with the PC community we know what we buy and we dont submit to abusive policies like console users do you can ing suck my I dont recommend this game or any supported by Take two interactive you need to respect .. dont insult our intelligency we are not stupidHere is my apport to you abusive toads
0;Ive played for a while now because i have friends that play. 20 minutes to log in and then bounced back out by a modder is the norm in this joke of a game. not even going to type the whole rant about pay to do anything in game unless youre modding. Rockstar has hit a new low with the latest patch.
0;GTA V is fun but rockstar is being a scammer by adding max payne 3 / shark card/ san andreas then bumping it up to 75 dollars to make it look like a sale when it is not.Rockstar treat your pc gamers better please or we won't be buying the next game you make.
0;Don t buy this game nothing but hacks and exploits. people crash your account if you kill them. Basicly it s one of the most hacked games i have ever played. sometimes you can t even play for many hours coz exploiters clean the servers in a rampage exploding everyone.
0;"""This is a very very good game I spent a least a hundred hours enjoying it.But unfortunately some idiots decided """"Let's make OpenIV which is a backbone for ALL mods ever existed in GTA IV and V illegal. Because they add microtransaction only premium vehicle to SINGLEPLAYER. AND WE'RE GREEDY COOPERATE THAT WANT TO MILK EVERY SINGLE CENT OUT OF OUR PLAYERS'S POCKET"""""""
0;Old opinion Simply one of the best games ever created even in 2016.Huge living world lots of missions lots of things to do lots of cars.Multiplayer is nice but definitley not for everyone. Lots of griefers and its hard to earn enough money.New opinion Dear Take 2 go F yourself.
0;Randomly banned for no reason by a faulty anti cheat/mod system mass banning thousands of players. Insanely terrible ban support system/customer service that runs by the guilty are guilty and the innocent are guilty. Rockstar is too lazy to acknowledge their mistakes aswell. It's guarenteed that they won't compensate for their mistakes aswell. I highly recommend you do not buy this game if you want to play online.
0;Want to live in fear of being banned for no reason? Do you like unjust treatment automatically dispensed by a broken anti cheat system? Are you ready for unilateral action taken against your hard earned time and assets by a heartless algorithim? If this sounds appealing to you AND you crave the woeful inaction and unresponsiveness of customer support that doesn't actually care about support this is the game for you.
0;"""The online feature of this game is the absolute worst part and you should not buy it for that. Instead buy it for the surprisingly well done story mode that has more to offer than the multiplayer does. The story offers about 30 hours of gameplay or so if you take it at a steady pace. It took me about 60 because of how broken up my """"can vidya"""" days are but yeah.Never buy any shark cards.Also Rockstar will ban you even if you don't cheat and blame you. And no I wasn't banned."""
0;Even after 1000+ hours I'd only kinda recommend it. There are many cars but they are increasingly expensive &amp R* attacks its own mod community. There are a variety of things to do but there will be MANY lengthy restarts. Single player issues have never been patched. Hackers are prevalent. Voice spam is lengthy to disable. Matchmaking is archaic and random at best.
0;Spent over $100 on this game. 360 copy + Sharkcard + PC copy many hours of playing on 360 but not so much on PC.Pros Excellent story mode really fun to play Great upgrade from GTA IV (map and gameplay wise) Lots of stuff to do / experiment with Fun to do stuff with friends (races heists etc.)Cons Rockstar is a horrible company Everything online costs millions and requires a ton of grinding (half of it you don't even use) Hackers/cheaters in almost every lobby practically unplayable
0;Updating this review to the negative due to the back handed tactics of take two and their money grubbing ways the game is good but the publisher should learn to diewe have all bought the game and itss way to late for a refund but try this with red dead two and ill make sure that gets pirated
0;This game has already been neglected by rockstar they are no longer keeping the game clean of hackers. EVERY game has hackers in it. Do not buy this game for online play I really wouldnt recommend buying it to support rockstar. If you decide you want to release a PC game you have to make sure you keep your servers clean neglecting to do so shows your companies true colors shows you do not care about the fans.
0;The game crashes after playing for like 10 mins. so i decided to switch to safe settings it lasted for like 20 minutes but still crashed at the end! Now i am at a longer mission that takes longer than 20 minutes. So now i cannot play the game. I even tried to redownload the game but that did not work. neither did changing some settings on my computer. Does anybody know what is going on???
0;ok i can't say i like the game or i love the game i can say these are not even powerful words to give my feeling about it i'm completely addicted to it i crave for it lol so many things to explore to do many many varied missions a very good multiplayer etc.it's just one of my favourite game everTHUMBS DOWN NOW AFTER 1350H OF GAMEPLAY BECAUSE OF F ...... SERVER PROBLEMS AND MODDERS STILL THERE
0;"""Horrible Launch. With millions in sales and prelaunch revenue this game should be polished and glitch free. I will NEVER pre order a rockstar game ever again.Game constantly crashes during game play at random intervals.""""GTA V is not responding"""" to """"GTA V has stopped responding""""My specs AMD 8350Crosshair V formula ZCrossfirex 2x280x16gb corsair platinum*editNew glitch / crashing""""Grand Theft Auto V has stopped working"""""""
0;Money rains from the skies and hackers just ruin your day but thats not even the worst thing.The worst thing is that the hackers rain money on you but then sometime later you get banned for not being able to evade the bags that just fall into your face.Rockstar support does not respond to tickets obviously since everyone who gets owned by hackers get hacker flagged.All i wanted to do is to just have a few good races with my buddies but no fun allowed i guess.
0;"""Shark Card baits. Take 2 interactive and Rockstar Games are extremely greedy with this game.The ingame prices are extremely high newer DLC expansions come up with ridiculous vehicles that make freeroam servers a hell of high level clubbers. the online game is plagued with cheaters that rockstar is not doing anything about.it's basically a big middle finger in your face that tells you """"give us your money""""here's a tip Don't."""
0;Rockstar support is terrible I was banned when I never modded too. Literally after I just bought a shark card. Take2 and Rockstar have some of the worst business practices lately I would NEVER buy any of their products. I suggest you avoid at all cost.
0;So i've been trying to get this game to work for hours now trying all kinds of fixes and diffrent things to get the damn thing to work and its really sad when im happy about getting an error code because before that i got nothing11/10 rockstar(it'd be different if steam/rockstar actually did something or said something or where helping anyone but they have just sat around dead silent)
0;Fun game to play online with some friends Pros +Awesome graphics+Good optimization+Fun large diverse map to exploreCons Hackers Hackers Hackers HackersConclusion Online is fun when you aren't getting power fisted by hackers in every lobby. I'd like to recommend this game but i can't until they fix all the t they are allowing on their servers
0;Wonderful game everyone else is right. Only one reason why I disliked this game As soon as you get into the game the grind for money is real. So real that you gotta spend tons of hours for just one new car. I hate that. If you don't like the grind don't buy this game.
0;Bought it at 8 pm. 2 days later the download is finished at approx 11 42 am.I have not stopped playing it until 9 am the next day. I am level 21 and my eyes are burnt out.Send helpEDIT Since 2016 a lot has changed in GTA Online that made me steer away from it. From game breaking glitches that are hella abused in public sessions to the god awful updates that encourage griefing. This game could have been great but due to dev's greed I'll be moving to FiveM in the future.
0;GTA V is awesome.GTA Online is ruined thanks to sharkcards and insane high ingame prices. If you have a social life with friends and all that this game is NOT for you.This videogame is perfect for people who have nothing else to do than grinding virtual money.
0;Online is a complete mess despite the amount of money im sure they have made with those shark cards.Hackers are everywhere constantly ruining the game and yet instead of solving that problem they just ignore it and go after the single player modders instead that arent hurting anyone.
0;I have to say this is one of the best game in the world but I also have to remind u that TAKETWO is a bitcxh!!!! This is a very special game which I recommend you to play the crack version and u might still go online with the multi5 or 5reborn mod............
0;hi i don't get the game start it rashes when the luncher are done loading. i have red that you can chage the name but i dn'r udertand the name i am supos to change is it MICROSOFT orSOCIAL CLUB i am really angry ofr this sh*t i pisses me really of wht can i do to get this sh*t to work
0;hey all dont buy this game gta 5 is a money scam they give u free dlc's ??? but u cant access them without the impossible amount of money that they wont let u earn cause its a scam so what do u do buya shark cardu probably bought about 3 or 4 shark cards per dlcnow is that free ? thats how they make their money and btw i can sell a pound of coke for way more then 20 grand like in missions lol pound of coke is so much more then that this game rips u off its a shell of what gta use to be
0;Everyone hacks online and Rockstar does nothing to stop it. Enjoy wasting your time trying missions while people in God mode kill you over and over again.Also if you try and play legit online the pay rates are way off. Rockstar pushes their sharkcards which are a total scam.The story is great but the broken online mode makes me regret paying for this game.
0;GTA V was turning into something special until Take Two decided they didn't want us to have mods. You have to grind and get griefed by script kiddies in GTA online or shell out money to buy Shark Cards. This is what Take Two wants just more money they don't care about your experience online. This is why they had OPEN IV shutdown. Everytime i join a multiplayer session there is at least one script kiddy never fails. If you are looking for a great online experience do not buy this game.

0;Paid $20 for hacks. gave money to everyone I found in lobbies. Gets banned because people abuse the hacks 10/10. Glad they're focused on making more money off of shark cards rather than just incouraging people to play with friends in solo lobbies or ban people who are abusing the hacks not giving people money.
0;This game is cancer they adjusted my account by 1.8 Million in currency that I earned through Motorcycle MC missions. The final straw for me was when I was executed outside my full drug lab. There support team is basically an idiom. Because they sure as hell do not support anybody. They've closed countless tickets on me and continue to deny my hard earned currency. RIP GTA You will be missed.
0;Pretty disappointing port filled with script kiddies and cheat engine cheaters.. Flying control is completely and un fun to use the very little customisablility with respect to playing with your friends. RP and money is a grind I assume to promote their cash card sales. I have very little hope of any meaningful updates or patches because why bother? they have fully tapped out all the markets. Also this game will never be legitimately modded as Rockstar are completely useless.
0;OK so this is a good Game and all but it is $60. That in mind there is a big problem for a lot of users preventing them from playing the game. i am one of them. Rockstar dosnt care at all and wont help us or refund us.P.S. i know there is alot of bad spelling but keep it to your self... i know i just dont care
0;single player is fun the online is a cashgrabbing guzzler and the mods have all been made illegal. Do not buy this game and i strongly advise against supporting any take two products in the future. They wont let people do what they want with their own games out of fear they will lose micro transaction income. If the cease and decist is retracted then i would advise buying it. If they refuse to however boycott the products.
0;Never buy this game cuz Rockstar doesn't comply costumer rights.All they they concider is MONEY.They do everything to make you buy shark cards although they have sold over millions of copies of F****** GTA V.A simple mission takes more than 40 mins or hours but all you got will be too little money which you won't be able to buy anything you want.
0;yea this was a good game only because of single player mods now your better off going for watchdogs 2!!! RIP Rockstar games due to the stupid OpenIV cease and desist order you have taken out against your biggest allie it made GTA more FUN and gave it a longer shelf life....OPENIV team thank you for your efforts
0;Well was really looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA 6 but not anymore. Single player mods are the best. Even more fun than playing online when my friends aren't on. I have the steam version which I use for single player mods and the Social Club version for online. Was also looking forward to all the upcoming mods but those are no longer going to happen. Oh well. Time to move on to another game anyway.
0;After over 10 years of being able to mod games Take Two has decided to declare it illegal in order to get more money from Sharkcards online which are a total scam. Rockstar is purposely making things in game more expensive and it is incredibly dull to try and grind enough to purchase the stuff that you want. Take Two just cares about money not about the games
0;"""Unacceptable antimodding behavior combined with a focus of DLC content strictly for the online mode has me disgusted. What happened to the single player DLC that was """"coming soon"""" back in 2014? I'm so tired of video games becoming cash cows. You won't produce a single player DLC and then have the audacity to try to remove modding services like OpenIV? Is the money worth becoming the next EA or Ubisoft?"""
0;Rockstar really did a great job on this game and it is by far the best open world game I've played.Amendment Due to Take Two's actions against OpenIV and other modding software I'm gonna have to revoke my support for this game. Unjust legal action trumps making a good game from my perspective.
0;Their mod support policy is completely garbage really takes the joy out of playing for fun after the main questline is finished.Also getting banned from multiplayer for using mods in the singleplayer is borderline . Stop trying to sabotage the people who want to make your game more enjoyable.
0;So much fun...goodbye Origin and BF4 such a let down. Get this game NOW! fps grinder sim...you name it this game has it covered.My edit...This game is wonderful but due to the gery of TakeTwo(more) and Rockstar I have uninstalled this game. It is a shame that the greed of corporate overlords leads them to make such detrimental descisions.

0;One of the greatest games of all time completely destroyed by greed. People create mods out of love for your game and instead of supporting that passion you rip those creative tools out of their hands. Disgusting greed and shameful disdain for your customers. SAD.
0;Take 2 interactive are greedy s so them any game they are over we are gonna take away open iv because it affects online like come on where is the ing proof you try to go online using open iv it says you are attempting to acces gta online with an altered version of gtav returning to single player they just want to force people to online so they can milk them of their money so take 2 you.
0;Its such a ing poor as game i only get killed by ing cheaters with poor aimbot camping 300meters away in a house shooting me through a wall bro if u wanna buy this game dont buy it its t so many chinese littel cheaters thats why asians have so small because they suck at video games off pubg.
0;Had a lot of fun in Singleplayer and doing the handful of heists with friends over and over again in a private lobby.Tried public lobbies for a bit and legit had a hacker in every other lobby I connected to.Can only recommend if it goes on a good sale and you have no intention of playing in public lobbies otherwise it's not worth your money.
0;Great game for the single player but on the multi player side is a different story but still great job rockstar! You did it again haha on the second thought you take2! you took away the freedom of creativity and fun at this game! you took it away with pride and greed. a**holes
0;GTA V has alot of issues with hackers. Tons of hackers in every public session. Don't listen to the crybabies claiming to be banned for no reason. Great single player 8.5/10 multiplayer though has some major issues with hackers and insane long loading times. Multiplayer 1.5/10 and i want that to be higher but to many issue!SO MANY HACKERS!! EVERY SINGLE GAME I GET TELEPORTED TO THE SKY AND KILLED! MY VEHICLE GETS BLOW UP BY HACKERS THIS GAME IS F ED DO NOT BUY IT TO PLAY ONLINE!!!!!!
0;the game is moving perfectly the graphics are wonderful .... it's a shame that after a few months of play the game starts to move hard and lagg.... i can not play this game because after 5 min of playing tha game start lagging ... and yes i my pc ahould normally run this game without problems
0;This review might change later but for the time being... I can't recommend this game. I bought it after debating for a bit but decided to jump in and enjoy it. It crashed a few times and was offered the self refund option. I tried it again and I was able to bind and play a bit of the game.... then it crashed again... I wish I had taken the inital self refund. If you read this my recommendation is to wait I bought it to enjoy it and now I just feel like I'm stuck with it as opposed to enjoy it.
0;Too enhanced on trying to go more into the future which is ruining the whole point of being a gangsta/criminal. Being a low level I can affor these pay to win items and get my beat my every with a exploding sniper rifle because they have put money into the game.
0;"""After working hard to gain cash on the game about an 8 hour grind a """"modder/hacker/bored GM"""" decided it would be fun to kill everyone on the server I just randomly burst into flames like everyone else and even when we died and respawned we were still on fire dying about 12 15 times. at that point I logged off knowing each death was costing me money for medical bills.The game itself is fantastic but this """"event"""" was total t."""
0;GTA V is perfecta game itself.. but if you want a good ONLINE GTA V u will be dissapointed because cheaters are everywhere!! Rockstar do nothing serious to stop them.Cheaters even modified my gta textures and whatever.. and i now need to reinstall whole game... no anticheat system..
0;By all accounts it was a decent game but the almost necessity of expensive microtransactions in the online and the new policy against modding the developers have just driven it down alongside other cashcow games that exist only to slowly siphon from your wallet.
0;High and mighty cheat shaming community even for a minor alteration of a game you own. Content you are outright grind blocked You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.I honestly hope more server attacks happen and fry the hardware.Pirate the game in protest.
0;Game got ruined after running out of any other ideas. Like I can't tell if this is GTA anymore its all flying bikes submarine cars jetpacks and shark cards. (When you can just jump lobbies until you find a hacker. Or wait until a hacker forcibly gives you money and you end up getting banned for it) I'm glad I played this game back when it was new and they weren't left trying to squeze out every bit of money they can get from you before this game dies.
0;Worst Launch I've seen yet I can't even Play the game I 've payed $60 for yet. I have to wait for Rockstar to fix it. Such a dumb error. I wonder what they are going to do to make up for all of us who cant even get passed the launcher.1. It took 30 minutes to link Social Club to Steam because of a login Error on their end. 2. Finally got past that now I can't get past the Launcher it crashes every time.3. Now we have to wait for who knows how long for a fix.This sucks Rockstar!
0;Let me start off on the right foot. this game is amazing i enjoy every minute of gameplay and cutscene because they just look fantastic. BUT I CANT PLAY THE GAME no matter what i do it just doesn't work. it crashes either the game or my entire computer. so please don't waste your money on this. buy gta 4 or any other one because they dont crash constantly.
0;I love gta online. I love gta story missions. I love the gta modded community. Just because they dont make any money on the story mode and mods doesnt mean you should stop making them. I bought gta largly for the story missions. I have spent countless hours playing modded gta aswell. Honestly this is just sad Rockstar.
0;"""""""Take two just essentially banned modding for this game I'll never support them again.""""Pretty much this. With no interest in online and a complete lack of meaningful single player DLC (i.e. story based content and not just a few weapons and cars) mods were all that kept me coming back to GTA V. Not happy."""
0;Game is kinda fun when you play with 4 people and have 2 hours for the load screen to pass.Currently running an i7 3.6ghz 16Gig of ram 2133 mhz 2x GTX 970's GTA5 on a 500GB SSD windows on a seperate 60GB SSD and I can launch GTA 5 online and after 10 minutes of sitting there looking at the same ing 4 pictures over and over kinda sucks.make the game more functional.http //steamcommunity.com/id/Sharpy0091/screenshot/307738832841658881
0;you need a monster Pc to run this game. i get no lag but every thing looks like I paid 60$ for shity game. On the up side it is fun. It is what i paid for. so i would say yes.why i chaged it to no.NO mods allowed they will ban you. I hope they change this.RIP GTA V
0;FUVKING AWESOME GAME OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG JUST PLAY ONLINE WITH YOUR FRIEND U WILL NOT SLEEP PU SEE UP ITS OLD REVIEW THIS NEWNOW I GIVE 1/10 cuz Rockstar remove my money in gta v all and RIP OPEN IV NOW NOOB
0;wanna have a multiplayer experience where you constantly killed by fire underneath or explosion on your faces out of nowhere? or you can get killed by a modder whom has god mode on. what a fun that would be ain't it? considering this game has at least 1 modders in every session expect this wonderful gaming experience brought you by rockstar games
0;I support the OpenIV team and video game modding as a whole. If you support modding your video games please do not support these developers. They have shut down efforts for anyone to attempt to mod their game. This is disgusting. I will never play this game again.
0;This is not a game to play with your friends. It's a game to play with subjects. If you wan't to be a MC or CEO the only one to profit from the missions is you not any of your friends so everybody ends by it's own. The only people who gets any profit from this game are the modders and hackers who don't need any money lol.
0;Take two have banned the use of mods of which has been a major part of this game series for as long as i can remember.They really screwed up this time. DO NOT buy Grand Theft Auto 5 in protest against this stupid act. boycotting can be quite a powerful tool.
0;Don't believe the recommended specs..... my pc meets the specs but have nothing but graphical issues even with lowest settings. This is the third release for this game. Why are there so many bugs graphical issues and connection issues? Plus I still haven't received my bonus money for the Online part of the game from my pre order. What's up with that? I submitted a ticket with Rockstar and have been ignored it seems. Anyone else get screwed on the pre order cash??
0;Loved this game to pieces on console I always had so much respect for this franchise. I'm dissapointed now that modding is banned and even if it came back they'll probably charge you to download mods too you TAKE TWO why don't you TAKE this thumbs down
0;Take Two just gutted the modding scene in an effort to push the pay 2 win hacker filled multiplayer version.I cannot in good conscience support this publisher or any of their titles.They reverted the cease and desist so OpenIV is back. My negative recommendation still stays. The fact that Take Two thought this was a good idea in the first place is reason enough. Not to mention the huge amount of microtransactions in a $60 game that's been out for years and sold millions of copies.
0;After installation process which took half a day and a 105 GB (!!!) of ssd space needed during the installation I later found out that no bonuses awarded neither as for returning player or for pre purchase. The PS3 version was so much better. Shame on rockstar ....
0;Really good game the story line is amazing I would recomend this to others but the online experience is dire I spend most of my time on loading scrreens waiting for another loading screen randomly timeout most of my sessions are full of hackers russians and ducks.Take 2 you silly people dont ban modding in single player after the story ends THATS WHERE THE FUN IS.
0;YOU ALL AND YOUR 'NES you are all incapable of making a CHEATER free server i hope someone hacks your servers and shuts them down so you can lose some money you mother ers .... i so regret buying this game .... cant even play for 5 minutes without someone hacking my character or just straight up blowing me up.... YOU ALL
0;Ok at the beggining of the release everything look pretty good but now almost in every session there is AT LEAST one hacker who in either in god mode or killing everydoby instatly DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL LOSE ANY KIND OF FUN BECOUSE OF HACKERS Rockstar do not give a sh t about banning them. Dowload this game from torrents and enjoy you will save money and patience while trying to do something with all these kids who use hacks.
0;Grand Theft Loading 5 Online It's bareable at first because of the exciment of playing a new GTA/GTL (Grand Theft Loading) but when you spend more time loading the game than you do playing you get exhausted after awhile. Bought on xbone 360 xbone one and steam and all are comparable and will probably continue to buy rockstar games as I enjoy them but Grand Theft Loading 5 Online will wear on you after 4 12 weeks if you're a reasonable person who doesn't have time.
0;i have to post a negative review because of the way rockstar treath their modders.gta sa mp has still over 1000 players and the whole community waited years for a new gta multiplayer client.Now rockstar took down gta mp.net and destroyed the future of modded servers.this is not acceptable and from now i will boycott gta v.damn rockstar learn to SUPPORT modders. this is why the most players play gta v. because of mods.finally learn your lesson rockstar!
0;Take TwoTake This....................../ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...')......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...
0;Plays online for 95 hours Attains a high rank office high end apartment and expensive car without buying shark cards Loses everything due to an error in Rockstar's cloud servers Calls and Emails customer service Directed to submit a request on their support site Asked to upload files before I submit the request Uploads files and is still unable to submit request No other way to contact Rockstar SOL 1/420 would scream at my monitor againThanks Rockstar
0;"""DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS MICROTRANSACTIONS DOWNGRADE FROM ANY OTHER GTA GAMEBut if you are more interested about the singelpayer then go ahead that aspect was great the online became just cancer full of grinding and loosing your time to just see how a new update brings more useless but """"better"""" stuff that you will want because they know how to trick our minds just like marketing does in real life."""
0;Rockstar raised price from 59.99 to 74.98 just before the Summer Sale. Online is unplayable because of hackers whose can frame you in possession of hacks. Rockstar sucks and is not doing anything.Also if you want to have fun in Online you must have A LOT of money so you must buy Shark Cards for real big money...
0;I gave this game a 8/10 when I bought it in june of 2015. I had many fun hours messing around in singleplayer but as of 15/6/2017 I do not longer recommend this game becouse of the closure of the open IV modding tool. This is a exactly dumb decision from Take two and I hope they come to their senses becouse the only reason GTA 5 was popular on PC was becouse of mods that is the only reason and I give it a couple of months before GTA 5 is dead if take two does not roleback their decision.
0;"""You have now ruined GTA 5 modding and have ruined the sole reason of playing this game. The single player without mods is boring after completion the multiplayer is a dead microtransaction piece of that is a sorry excuse for a multiplayer and now apparently no more mods are allowed because they are now """"illegal"""". you Take Two Interactive. you.UPDATE Open IV is now back in action! Thank you Rockstar for talking some sense into Take Two. As for Take Two ing burn in hell."""
0;Sort your dev's out.0 efforts being made to stop the hackers on the Multiplayer rendering the game unplayable online..Virtually 0 improvements made to the poor lobbying systems honestly one of the poorest releases for a Triple A title and highest grossing games in history.Very poor.Do not buy plenty more games worthy of 40.
0;why is this game still $70? the only part of this game that is any good on PC is single player. online is just filled to the rim with modders that can blow you up just by driving past you. I would consider the 50% off price of this game to be the full price of this game that's all it's worth.
0;"""I Mean You Know Its Gta And Its Pretty Cool Fun And Well Maded But In Gta Online I Realy Think That Rockstar Should Freaking Stop Banning Peoples Because They Recived Money From """"Modders"""" Its Not Our Fault. And We Should Not Get Banned From Online If WE Didint Modded The Game..."""
0;still has a lot of bugs i have a 4g graphic cards and it thinks i only have a 1g idk how that works but great job rock star. Also found out today the person who made the keyboard controls was so ed up when he did it he didnt think if your flying a plane and you get a call you lose all control cuzzzzzzzzzz its the mouse that controls it. WOW how about you dude you gave me the worest head ache ever so you twice.
0;Don't buy. Take two killed modding. Modding made this game as amazing as it was. It was a great game now it isn't anymore. Wouldn't buy it if I were you.EDIT The modding tool is back now! It's great once again!EDIT 2 Yup... Changing this review again.. They removed money from me for no ing reason. It wasn't much like a million or two but it was a pain in the to make it back since I couldn't afford to buy a vehicle warehouse to make money fast
0;thanks open iv is back for SOLO player but it's a loss of time to reinstall all the mod again after each update i even created a copy of the game but this solution take a lot of space in the disk so thank you but making this game unplayable in solo mod without internet is a stupid idea.
0;The story mode is great it really is. HOWEVER. After you finish it you're left with nothing to do except play online. And GTA Online is anything but great. I won't explain all the scummy tactics of Rockstar a lot of reviewers have done it before me. I'm just going to confirm that they're all telling the truth.
0;The online game play is fun the problem I have is the online game and off line game are like playing two different games all around like off line game you die quick unlike the online game you do not. I know many to list but with the delay on PC side to fix stuff Very disappointed.
0;I love this game but it's like a bad relationship I keep coming back expecting it to change and it doesn't. I can even look past the shark card nonsense and over priced free content but the lack of support and modding has finally after so many years gotten so bad that you literally cannot find a session without a modder turning a server into their own amusement park. Reporting these modders has been laughable for years and they even brag in public games that it will do nothing.
0;I used to recommend this game but now i won't. The developer has intentionally increase the vehicle prices to a state where we need to grind so hard for a freaking car. That's not all it took a long time to make a milion dollar in this game except playing repetitive heists. There are Tons of cheaters too..
0;Still can't play the game. I click play it spins up Steam says I'm in game and it just crashes. Don't even get a window or anything. I bought it back in January so don't feel like refunding just waiting out for a patch I guess? I have a desktop with AMD.
0;DON'T BUY!!The 60 bucks that the game costs it's only an ADMISSION FEE.in order to buy the content for the updates they want you to buy CASH CARDS like the Megalodon one that costs even more than the game itself. either that or you get money from a hacker.PAY TO WIN? more like PAY TO HAVE FUN or pay to acces every little cool thing that come with the updates.Hope that a lot of hackers will come and destroy R* economy.R* is killing the game anyway.DON'T BUY!!
0;spend $9999 in microtransactions to get anywhere or get banned and buy the game again basically. Good game. Terrible company. Accounts are locked so you cant use your char on someone elses pc. And seriously if you heard half of the things R* does to its employees youd give a kid a cigarette just to feel clean again.
0;When GTA first came out on Steam it was really fun and enjoyable experience... But since Rockstar thought it would be funny to start banning players for no reason I have changed my mind about this game. And this is written after getting banned for a second time
0;Not worth the money....bugs everywhere the gameplay is not polished the story is okOnline is unplayable more grinding than in every MMO p2w is present everywhere the only situation where i havent had a hacker on the server was when i was alone on an server The Money you earn is in no relation of the money you need to buy basic features.....I dont know why this game gets hyped its just garbage
0;Mods are back. Doesn't change the fact that the multiplayer is a broken grindfest full of cheaters though. Simply not worth it if you plan to play multiplayer exclusively.Game also comes with a huge amount of issues. Social Club is a broken piece of software and probably one of the worst forms of DRM I have ever come across. It's ridiculous
0;Extremely fun and would have played it more but... I cant even finish the damn heists cause i would need to wait literly an hour each time i have to do a set up and then some noob would join and immediatly leave or keep dieing and i would need to restart. gta should take a page from l4d's book and keep the game going and dont ruin it for everyone when some dumbass leaves. took over 20 hrs just to get past the lamar missions because of people who cant even sit and even play for 10 mins.
0;This game is a grindy hacked mess. With every dlc comes new vehicles planes jobs and other utilites. But guess what each individual item costs $3 000 000+ each totally nearly $300 per update JUST TO EXPERIENCE WHAT WAS ADDED.What the hell is this? Why are we being force to work jobs and earn our money in GRAND THEFT AUTO. Make the planes spawn in. Make the new cars spawn in. I have a job already why the would I want to work another one when I come home just to earn virtual t.
0;Turned my review negative for this because of 2 reasons.1. The game is littered with hackers online and it seems Rockstar can't keep up with getting rid of them. 2. Take2 &amp Rockstar's attitude and actions towards FiveM &amp other 3rd party multiplayer mod developers. Rockstar will milk the **** out of this game and not care about its community until they suck every penny from it.
0;I have been playnig this game since the ps3 release of the game.And I own the PS3 PS4 and PC version of the game. hax at every faking where.they are pleased to u even your internet is fine the server will not register your hit and then u will get killed instead making money is ing hard unless you have some cheating softwares a vehicle will cost you 6mil long loading time. even worse then ps3/ps4 everything is all about heists. boring af.
0;They've updated the game about 30 times with new stuff to buy but bugs that have been there since day 1 go unpatched. Unless of course that bug allows you to change your characters clothes or obtain in game money. Matchmaking is a mess. It is the worst I have ever seen implemented in any game to date. It never works. The game is full of bugs and glitches that Rockstar flat out ignores whilst pushing out money grab updates over and over.
0;If you like getting killed by hackers in literally EVERY. SINGLE. LOBBY then this is the game for you.Hey they finally got rid of all the hackers! But now my ing game isn't playable. God damn it rockstar. I payed $70 for this ing game and I expect it to work! Get your together.
0;This game will **** your over and be a complete waste of time and man i thought ea was bad taking 200$ dollars out my pocket each year but this game wont even let you complete the ultimate heist mission with out banning you the next week and tbh the rendering and distance scaling feaure is and to top it all off its service is **** so dont buy it its a waste of money
0;GTA V online is a scam to get you to use micro transactions to make money because doing any activities to grind the money takes too long. Heist are not possible to do since they require multiple people but no one ever completes them due to Quitters discconnects or overall bad match making. Take 2 also RUINS MODDING for me which is the only reason why i ever play the game anymore. Don't expect to be back playing while Rockstar tries the screw us over.
0;i bought GTA V for pc since i dont have a next gen console and it did not work at all. My Pc can run star citizen just fine but my FPS would drop down to 10 20 frames for no reason i honestly have to say that out of the 108 minutes i had it before i got my refund i spent 65 messing around with settings to get a better FPS to no avail. To which i have to say i am very disappointed more so that i'm still stuck playing this on 360 and not on my Pc.
0;Single player nice multiplayer impossible due to bad designed servers Stare from clouds get ready in a 31 player map while your friends are in an other map load into your friends map get whacked upon way to friends house finally join a heist then friends pc crashes all members of heist go to different server. Useless.
0;Played about 40 hours and got a perma ban. Never cheated no mods no prior bans. Took $ weeks for rockstar to fix an install problem before buying it on steam. Played with a few friends and got banned. Never recived a response. The servers are filled with modders that kill other players and make online boarderline unplayable. Rockstar no longer cares abouth this game. Don't waste your money.
0;Do not buy this game. Rockstar and TakeTwo are a bunch of money grubbing pieces of crap who are only interested in microtransactions. They could care less about the happiness and satisfaction of their playerbase and only see us as floating wallets. Burn in hell Rockstar and TakeTwo.
0;Banned with no explanation or time frame. Keep in mind that any user who is offended at another player can submit player cheating reports as well as tell their friends to do so. The system of automated banning does not work at all and absolutely ruins the game more than any supposed modders.

0;This game is a piece of rockstar are ing useless for abit 2 weeks now ive had a ticket and no response i payed 40 pound to play this game and i got to play it for around 10 hours then it starts crashing on me after around 5 10 minutes of playing ive tryed bloody everything to fix this reinstalling verify game cache even defragged my hard drive to no success and rockstar can't even be bothered to help me.
0;an open sandbox game that doent allow modding.....REALLY. if someone buys a game for FULL price they should be able to play the game as they see fit. maybe if rockstar(take two) wouldnt try and sell WAY overly priced shark cards(8mill for a $100)and be money hungry little jews(i mean no offence if your actually jewish) they wouldnt have this problem they dont need the extra cash to make DLC just take a look into the sales side of things.
0;Take Two just (14 June 2017) gutted one of the most critical modding tools for GTA with a cease and desist effectivly killing most of the modding scene to try and force people to their fee to pay multiplayer gongshow rather than let people have fun like they want.Avoid until (if ever) they unscrew it all.Update 24 June 2017 Rockstar has come out in defence of mods. Things might be okay after all but Take Two are still greedy and online is a raging torm as always. Time will tell.
0;Just went to complete hackers spawn money on you without your choice and rockstar removes your legit money too for the hackers that they werent able to stop themselves the same hackers that come into the lobby and kill you with godmode for months at a time and still dont get banned... This game is utter and nothing but an excuse for rockstar to sell you shark cards
0;Imagine ruining a game for fans who made the last game have such a large following.Truth is since the start this game has been ripping off their fans initial release was delayed heist were shown to be a large part of online but upon release quickly died off online is full of bugs.Do not buy they just want our money thats why online everything is so expensive so you have to buy shark cards unless you grind for hours
0;game is ok how ever rockstar are a bunch of rip off merchants taking in game money that is earnt from doing missions and heists .There are major problems with the way they conduct themselves they allow modders to interfere with legit players online wrecking game enjoyment for honest players also dont bother buying shark cards as they will take the money you receive from them and say you didnt earn it .At end of day rockstar need to sort their crap out or loose lots of respect and players
0;I always get disconnected from online hard for me to make money on the game with that. I can't get on the game and have fun anymore. ( I port fowarded all the ports that they provided and still didnt work. Thanks for choosing me to be another unlucky one.
0;"""Generally grindy and cash grabbing online with a toxic community that ruins much other reason to play. Singleplayer is interesting but with Take Two hunting mods now there's not much to do that's really """"fun"""" beyond completionist collectibles and what not."""
0;This version of the game was only worth it for mods but take two and 2k have ed it and gave the tool openlV a cease and desist. off you corporate tyrants. Also for anyone who reads this... dont let this become a precedent and over any creative modding scenes in the future. Complain. Argue. And dont buy this game.
0;Was an amazing game until the greedy people at 2K decided that we cant mod the game anymore (the whole reason i bought the game on pc in the first place) I do not recommend this game to anyone who likes to have fun and play the game the way they want to
0;this game has a pretty solid single player which is even better with MODS but now that you can't have that the only thing left is online which is trash loading screens take forever everyones toxic and i have yet to be in a server without being immediatly killed/teleported/trolled by hackers due to lack of any sort of cheating prevention system TL DR its like buying a box of chocolates but the seller takes all the chocolates away after you buy it.
0;GTA is an amazing series. However once superpowers in the industry like Take Two come in they LOVE to ruin the modding scene. I won't be purchasing another Take Two game from here on out until they fix their buisness plans. You should NEVER force microtransactions on players when they pay you 70 ING DOLLARS for your product. Theres already a MASSIVE uproar starting in the community Take Two and you best fix these issues before you have some irreversable damage.
0;Loading screens for ease of pain play with 3 friends for missions is making this game worse.Oh Yeah they banned mods......................./ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...')......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...
0;Once you beat the single player campaign there really isn't to do in this game. Online is frustrating and basically pay to play. The only thing about this game that kept bringing me back was the mod scene which has been getting the cold shoulder from the publishers as long as there have been GTA mods. If the publishers want people to play their games they need to embrace the things that people actually enjoy.
0;Just read about what Take Two has done as a result of issues surround modders within multiplayer. The destruction of the main community and individuals that will essentially keep your game alive for years to come is not a good way to solve a problem that causes your multi billion dollar company to loose a bit on a 4 year old game. Very dissapointed that Rockstar could allow this to happen.
0;Time to stop the micro transactions ITS TIME TO STOP TAKE TWOBring Back the MODSThe funny thing is that they think we were to stupid to notice that they did this. Well now it looks like Take Two Interactive has a little bit of a riot on there greedy hands
0;Third time I've bought the game sorry my 60$ wasnt good enough along with you having the 4th highest selling game of all time. Only reason I bought this in PC was for mods. I will not buy or play and 2K or Rockstar games until OPEN IV is allowed to come back.
0;Bliss for 2 weeks when they banned openiv app. Now they caved like little girls because so many cheaters complained. Dont buy this game to play online all your grinding work crates drugs cars will get destroyed by cheaters. You will have people shooting at you with rpgs from cars people will use aim bots to make impossible sniper kills or throw u up in the air when your about to kill them. Not worth it.

0;Hackers are a problem in any game. However this one has hackers that crank it to 11. Still a good game tho level 120 and no (major) issues yet.EDIT MAJOR ISSUE R* and TakeTwo for trying to kill modding. I should be able to use the product I payed for however I like as long as I don't ruin others' enjoyment.
0;Rest in Peace OpenIV we shall not forget thy name when modding... you will recieve all the fish you want in modding heaven.... _ R.I.P. GRAND THEFT AUTO 5 MODDING.... RAISE YOUR DONGERS IN PROTEST. you Rockstar and Take Two I hope you will recognize your mistake in doing this horrible deed. You have awoken the monster of bad reviews.Support the petiton to save OpenIV (Sorry dont have link other reviews surely have them) YOU AND YOUR SHARK CARDS
0;For **** sake I love this game the single player anyway and modding was the only way for me to continue playing seeing as Rockstar scrapped the story DLC in favor of multiplayer and now with them essentially eliminating modding to appease multiplayer this is the last straw and now we all have to take drastic action.STOP ****ING OVER SINGLEPLAYER
0;Look I'm not on the wagon that we should totally boycott rockstar. I completely dissagree with their choices to deny modding especially single player mods. If people that want to mod can't? Return the game.. don't buy it Vote with your wallet. If you don't want to mod then fine buy it! Unless you want to support those that have a problem with this anti mod practices. Rockstar... c'mon guys wtf.
0;Rockstar is currently banning anybody who has used/is using mods even in singleplayer. Additionally they have failed to secure their game against the simplest of cheats on the most vulnerable platform. You'd think a AAA game would care about its customers and be properly secured...
0;Just look at this review. Now since it's irrelevant fyck off take two!There's no need to write anything that could lure you more into this game. Just take a look at some of the things you can do in the amazing open world *cough* pls RDR2 for PC! *cough*and see what a loving community can create. MODS! Well downloadmoreram didn't died for rekt.
0;now the free expansions are nice but banning mods first for online and now for singleplayer is mad. they just try to squeeze as much money out of players by making the already expensive game hard to grind in online forcing people to buy shark cards.and now they force people to play more online by basically making the singleplayer boring after completing the story mode.they probably did not expect this backlash.
0;I'd stay away from this game until such time that rockstar decided to let you play the game you paid for how you want. At the moment not playing the game the way they want you to will get you banned. They do not want the modding community to take off because they are invested in there microtransactions and selling us stuff later. Anything the modding community makes is seen as a threat to there income.
0;Dont buy this game.Instead of banning hackers that mod GTA Online that risk everyones account they decided to ban mods on singleplayer which dont harm anyone.I guess it takes too much effort for that and cant handle it.Overall the game has nice story but online is pretty sh bad.
0;Online went to with the modders and the grinding it takes to actually be able to afford the DLC they are bringing out. Then they go and ban modding on single player. That was the only reason I played the game no point now. Take 2. Take 2 in your mouth ya fannies.
0;I was banned unfairly like a lot of other people so I just used the Steam version for single player mods only to find out that Take 2 have basically killed SP modding. Do not recommend. GTA is just an over inflated micro transaction hellhole. A Yacht converted to real money is 120$ AUD.
0;Take Two Interactive is trying to kill one of the key features of PC Gaming starting with a devastating blow to Grand Theft Auto modding. If they start pulling this on all of their owned games then goodbye to modding in Civilization games and Kerbal Space Program.
0;So it's illegal to mod now? Hmmm seems to me like Take Two (Rockstar) are instead having issues with their own programming and are now going to downgrade any kind of playability the game had. Oh well maybe they will hear us for once instead of just banning random people who have done nothing and destroying a foundation of the game for no reason. Situation is worse than when it was pay for mods.
0;Started as a great game... then got better on PC with offline mods that have kept the game alive. GTA Online is a sh*tshow full of 12 year olds who troll the crap out of you. Yet for some reason T2 decided to go after OpenIV which is how we do most of our offline modding and why most of us rebought this title and continue to play it. Bad move noone wants to play your mediocre online and buy your shark cards so you go after the single player modders. bye felicia
0;I was addicted to gta online but after 500 hours i got bored and at the moment it has so many bugs an problems its a pain in the I tried contacting customer support about these issues but they always blamed me about the problems. Also i think the game is a bit too pay to win atm. RIP modding. I would recommend this game but there are way too many issues right now.
0;I cant even play the game! I installed it and whenever i go to play it i cant. It just doesnt respond after a feew seconds of a black screen and and has to force close. I tried everything on the website and nothing has worked. Therefore i give it a 0/10.
0;Take Two Interactive has decided the shut down OpenIV the tool used for modding GTA V. With this many mods will no longer be available essentially killing the singleplayer modding scene. As an avid modder this is terrible the PC community will not accept this screwing over of your fan base. I paid $60 for a game with the expectation to be able to mod it but Take Two has decided that I cannot do that. On behalf of the OpenIV team you.
0;If you're going to buy and play this game by all means do so for the single player mode. As for online you've missed the boat. The game is littered with hackers Rockstar doesn't even bother to ban them anymore. Don't spend a red cent on in game currency or waste any time leveling. Other than that the single player mode is solid.
0;Single Player 8/10 + great story+ amazing graphics+ beautiful map+ in depth characters+ in game events+ Music repetitive missions no casino glitches unrealisticOnline 1/10 hackers bans glitches servers lagging community is SALTY bad players no matchmaking heists are boring and pointless missions are brokenOnline needs serious revamping.
0;they recently removed anyway of modding the game. FOR SINGLEPLAYER. not even online. they have always been battling that which not suprising. but to attack a single player mod that has been around for over 10 years. all so they can get more micro transactions from multiplayer. thats pretty dang messed up. please dont buy the game. the devs dont deserve your support
0;Take Two does not deserve your money it is legal precedent that modding through Open IV was legal but they chose to disregard that anyways. No one buys this on PC for the vanilla or online they screwed over all the community. Take Two does not respect you don't give them any of your money until if they possibly reverse their decision (and they won't). In other words never buy or play anything from Take Two Interactive again.
0;"""Take Two Interactive the publisher of GTA V is trying to screw us all. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. CUrently they are attacking the moding comunity and have walled off content from the single player with the aim to make you spend money on """"micro"""" transactions in the multiplayer.Simply put they are using anti consumer practises and therefore you shouldn't buy this game."""
0;Rockstar and Take Two already screwed us PC players over by saying literally nothing about a PC version for the game for more than a year after release (wouldn't have been that hard to just say 'hey don't worry it's coming') and they are probably doing the same with RDR2 but now trying to eliminate the modding community for their games is just completely f*****g us over.We should stop supporting them for now they need to know that they can't get through with this.
0;Do not purchase this while Take Two actively seeks out to destroy the modding community. OpenIV is a community driven tool active since GTA III dedicated to provide amazing and easy to use modding capabilities for single player.When rectification takes place and Take Two again allows the development of OpenIV I will adjust this review and happily thumb up GTA V.
0;Just read some of the reviews here. Open IV was shut down which is ******* stupid because mods can add years to a games lifespan. Loading takes forever. Making money takes forever. Takes 10 drconds to ruin someones hard work which probably took them all day doing. If they really shut down open iv due to online hackers why not just seperate the two games (online and story) so modders can still work the magic in one
0;The SP is superb. 9/10The MP has a large potential but it hasn't been used. Instanced 30 players cap per server flying sux lots of rubberbanding (imagine the lag from china to spain) few motivation to PvP beyond ganking interaction menu is useless in pvp etc etc...4/10Buy it if you're a SP fan. Don't if you'd like to PvP.
0;This game is trash take two banned modding and without that the game is basically dead they want us to play online and pay them money they are just MONEY HUNGRY screw all of you not supporting you and never will there is also a petition going on it is call Save Open IV go to be part of it if you can
0;This used to be a fun and imaginative game. Now it's become exactly like the city after which it is modeled. Full of heartless haters and uncontrolled cheating it's become a contest to see who has the biggest wallet and the smallest heart. Single player was good until they banned OpenIV now we can't even customize single player.
0;Thanks for screwing over the modding community it's not like the reason i am still playing this game today is because of mods nah not at all....... I dont understand what you are trying to achieve but it certainly seems to make you guys get a very bad reputation. I once loved rockstar and their games and how they allowed people to mod their games in singleplayer. I dont recommend this game if you are a modder like me because at the moment they dont seem to be supporting mods.....
0;Until Take2 interactive decides to allow mods again I cannot recommend playing GTAV. It is a good game but when I purchase something for myself I should be allowed to modify it in any way I like. This review will change if Take2 decides to stop being s and trying to get people to buy shark cards by disallowing mods for story mode.
0;Every time an update rolled out for multiplayer I would na�vely see if even a few of the features were included in singleplayer only to be disappointed time after time. With the new company attitude towards singleplayer modification what once was a selling point is now fading away. The game is fun online is fun but forcing this constraint takes away what the game could be and indeed what the game I paid for should be.
0;Went back to my positive review from 2 years ago when I still had hope for this game to finally deliver on the promises of pre console launch. The shark cards and updates have been a joke the fans have asked for heists and single player expansions since launch and been ignored. Don't buy this game for online and if you do want to try the story don't pay more than 20 euro.
0;This game is very fun however I believe there are many more games that you would be better off spending your $60 on. Mods don't work and whenever there is a new update their seems to be new problems. After pushing this game release date back for PC people wanted a game that was fun and operated correctly after all this time.
0;"""Take Two has literally just killed this game and possibly Rockstar. They are getting rid of the main selling point for it on Pc MODS. Atleast a certain other greedy company """"Paid Mods """" understands that mods are what sells their game. RIP your income."""
0;"""This game will get positive reviews only if Rockstar will UNBAN EVERY SINGLE PLAYER wich got banned for """"modding"""" because more than half of them got banned because they got money from a modder.Btw your anticheat suck so much ban the real modders not te victims of themBad english sry"""
0;"""This will be the last R* game I purchase. Multiplayer is trash everyone is looking for """"Shrek"""" or a modder/hacker to gib me dat money. Lobby wait times are over 20 minutes if you can get into a game most people bounce the eff out of there before you can cash out. Single player is a solid 20/10. Make the GTA online expansions for single player FFS. This game gave me the Aids"""
0;Words cannot describe the level of ed up you just achieved almost to the levels of 'One Man's Lie' but still pretty over the line.What possible risk or hazard could it bring upon your company?Good luck selling anything else after this you basically just signed your death warrant by not allowing SP mods.
0;wish i didnt get game i played online all fine got 8.000.000 sharkcard and ended up earning over 50 million in the time iv had game. then modders started giving me money and Rockstar update game and takes all my money saying it was all Illigitimately gained so now i have no money so rockstar can f off. if u dont beleve i earned lots of money in short time im in wheelchair so got sod all else to do...
0;Online never worked because of account corruption. The whole game stopped working 3 months later. I have recieved about 14 e mails from Rockstar support and these bots have never solved a god damn thing. Later I discovered that there is no way to get refunded. Thank you Rockstar. You suck hard
0;"""I really enjoyed modding this game. It was the biggest reason I bought this on PC in the first place. But since mods are now """"illegal"""" for this game I don't give a about it anymore. Thanks for ruining a great modding experience because you hate your fanbase."""
0;Truly a disgrace to the tens of thousands of modders across the globe. This was literally the ONLY reason I bought this on PC.. I've bought this when it came out on Xbox 360 then on Xbox One and now I don't see a need to even bother playing on PC. Just a wasteland and with the removal of OpenIV modding is... no longer a thing.
0;I guess I'm going to leave a negative review since Take Two decided to go after GTA modding. Single player game is fun but I'm tired of this Also the online is kind of and grindy. GTA IV's online was more simplistic but I found it a lot more fun because it didn't have artificial barriers put up to try to get players to spend real money.
0;Do they not realize that half of the games replayibility comes FROM their modding community?? I cant even get into my game unless I reinstall it now. But i guess I have no real reason to reinstall it anymore. The Online community is toxic and boring anyway. Might as well free up the space.
0;Forget the whole open IV situation im sick of playing online like its a FTPits like im not shown any respect. The only way to make any real money is through hacking or buying shark cards and when its someone like me who doesnt necessarily have friends to play with that part of the game is tottaly useless. Dont support take two or rockstar for that matter.
0;The single player side of this game is great. I like the storyline and multi character options. The GTA Online part however is a great dissapointment. I was looking forward to play this game in a 2 player cooperative mode. However once again the multiplayer side is entirely pvp. In a game like this where cooperative gaming gives so much benefit i cant believe it has been left out.Maybe GTA 6 will finally include this. lets just hope the fans on pc arent left out for a few years.
0;thanks for scrowwing up gta 5 for me now i cant even play it the one and only way i had to make money yall took away so way even play gta 5 is geting not better i now me being just one person does not meen iney thing to yall so good bye o i am one that does mission to make money but yall just down graded the mission so it is not worth doing
0;It was good but over the time it gets boring it's good for the first year of play though.After a year of it's release in PC it's no more than a corporate cashgrab expensive items that is exclusive to the online and have to mod for it to be available in the offline/story sharkcards. It's no longer good now.
0;Take Two has ruined the GTA community since they have decided to remove single player mods and openiv and that doesnt harm the game or online in anyway. I am very frustrated i cant mod SINGLEPLAYER because it ruins online. But its ok I will just buy thousands of sharkcards on a stale game with reskinned updates.
0;Rediculous. To combat multiplayer modding to stop people who don't want to grind hundreds of hours or pay irl $$$ to unlock mediocre content they make SINGLE PLAYER modding illegal by shutting down OpenIV. OpenIV has NOTHING to do with multiplayer modding! Never buying a Take Two game again.
0;I have put quite a bit of time into GTA V and I find it really fun to play with friends and sometimes even by yourself but after what happened at E3 I cannot recommend this game to you just because of how horrible the developers have acted towards the GTA V community.
0;After hackers plagging the Online for more than a year (maybe even year and half) and the constant new microtransactions in the form of the trash that is Shark Cards Take Two along with Rockstar are becoming a shame and ripping apart this game that was once gold.Going back on the situation of locking modding isn't enough to justify a positive review they are in the sh it and do sh it decisions.The game is now but a shadow of what it could have been. What a shame...
0;The single player mode of this game is good but the online segment is horrid. Not so much because of the gameplay but because of all the hacking and how Rockstar isn't able to contain it.The Online mode could be great but there is no point in going onto a public game unless you want to run the risk of being banned because someone uses your name to kill everyone on the server or tosses loads of money onto you.
0;the game is great and the new updates they put out for GTA online looks really cool too bad you get banned from online without a reason and now they remove modding from singleplayer. The only reason to get this game is to play the story and the vanilla singleplayer.
0;GTA5 is a good game. But the problem with the game is not the game itself but the online community. hacks and mods running in online mod breaks the game. People playing with unfair advantages just makes honest players so frustrated. Rockstar chooses to do nothing which will only deterioate the online community and ultimately lose players.Though Rockstar said people should report hackers and cheaters but reports does nothing and it seems Rockstar does not give a
0;Used to be really fun when it first came out and I still occasionally have fun with friends but the massive amounts of inflation in the games prices in order to drive Shark Card sales have been kind of ridiculous. Combine that with the way they are going after non hacking mod builders and I just don't really recommend it.
0;Great game almost triple the offline hours just screwing around in singleplayer. Small problem after their latest update I get the message that I have a modded game client. This is a known problem apparently and Rockstar's support on these things still haven't gotten to it...an update that happened the 14th of March. Great game 10/10 gameplay.God awful support that tends to ban for no reason as well as screw up the game.
0;GTAV As best described here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_okI'm leaving this review in regards to T2 and R* 's decesion to send a cease and desist to OpenIV in a deliberate attempt to kill off modding. In terms of the game itself single player was ok with mods it was awesome. Online sucks to many micro transactions.Sign this petition remind T2 and R* why most of us bought this game https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;Been stucked in the game luncher loading process for literally an hour and nothing happened. I tried to restart steam change compatibility restart computer and basically anything I could think of but still couldn't solve the problem. I'm quite disappointed by this weird bug I don't care about in game bugs because I know it's not easy to solve every single one of them at launch but I think players should at least be able to play the game right?
0;I do not support this greedy company and how they shut down mods . The modding community is why I bought the game so looks like I won't be buying your future and up coming games . I do not recommend this game or any other game from Take 2 or Rockstar.
0;what t2no follow through on single player dlc then online is turned into a F2P hardcore grindfest that isn't fun unless you cheat money into the game or spend literally hundreds to thousands on real life money to buy stuff in game? niceoh and single player modding isn't allowed now either probably because you think it is taking away from the online playerbase and cutting into your ridiculously grubby cash grab of a game? nice
0;Don't get me wrong I've had alot of fun with this game. But god damn if take two and R* don't have some shoddy business practices. The direction that this game has taken over the last few months I'm going to confidently say DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUY SOMETHING ELSE.
0;Just who in the right mind would not allow to mod a game. It's seriously the best part about the game. Online starts getting so repetitive that I would like to play singleplayer but every new feature that comes to the game only comes to online. So thats a big middle finger to the gamers. Seriously Rockstar Games you used to be awesome. WTF Happend?
0;"""Shameless cash grab. Used to have some replay value but they've gotten rid of mods which ruins the game after the campaign. Online isn't any good either as the only way to make any substantial amount of money in order to buy the repetitive """"new"""" content that comes out every month is to buy the in game money with real money (Shark Cards)."""
0;GTA Online is awful. It's filled with griefers racists and little kids. Instead of doing something about this R* decides to take down the one thing that makes single player mode tolerable. GTA Online is a grind and every update brings more ridiculously overpriced DLC items. it's obvious that R* only cares about making money from shark cards.
0;I leave the bottom and my reccomendation unchanged yes it is true that OpenIV is probably back for good now but regardless. It did happen and they tried to just sweep it under the rug. This should never of happend in the first place and Take Two have destroyed their already brittle reputation.Shame really been playing this game on and off for 2 years and now after 50 60 hours of playing with mods Take Two decides enough is enough. RIP mods and RIP open IV the backbone for almost every GTA mod.
0;Story was great multiplayer is slow servers kinda suck people getting banned from shark cards sounds awful. Well worth it during a sale. Wouldn't pay full price until these issues are resolved completely. Got it for 40 bucksEdit Not cool to take down modded servers. Grabbing my pitchfork
0;Lets support Open IV by boycotting the SHARK cards from now on this is how we will respond to banning of MODS.Honestly why let something like this grow for over a long period of time and then come out of nowhere and tell them to stop it its like teaching a kid to walk and then not allowing him to.
0;You spend more time loading than actually playing. You'll spend 10 minutes getting a group together and driving only to have a mission failed by someone disconnecting. Everyone mods and cheats. One of the most toxic player bases I've seen. The controls are garbage. Servers fail to load or save constantly. Support is garbage. Worst game ever. Wish I could get even a partial refund and I bought it on sale.
0;Well its not that bad but i need to say something when i was playing as usual im going to do my finale heist of prison break after all the killing shooting till the end one idiot just afk while parachuting to the beach well fk him that he's not respecting on team mates there must be some idiot who will ruin this game's mission so far i wish those idiots won't appear in gta online again in the future.
0;Well this game was good wait thats a lie. Its only good with mods for offline use and now take two have banned the mods and taken open iv is down. This is the only reason many people by the game is just for the mods. Take your time and sign this petition. https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;Downloaded the Game was hyped as . And then? Well the game starts....well thats waht my steam profile says....for about 3 seconds and nothing happens after that. i am so happy to pay 60 for an Icon .Extra Yes my PC has the requirements No i dont use anything other than the ABC in my windows name Yes R* still has nothing to say about this bug (they should move there are 80 pages in the Steam Forum regarding thi issue.
0;"""GTA V is fun for a while and GTAO is also entertaining but then you realize how much of a grind it is for NOTHING. A few cars and guns just to help you grind even more and maybe buy a yatch (or something similar). With the issues about mods shark cards """"free"""" dlc etc both Rockstar and Take Two are devolving into what players loathe."""
0;Sick and tired of AAA developers removing modding from PC Gaming. It's been the cornerstone of the PC experience and people shouldn't stand for it any longer. Here's to hoping this kills the games sales and generates additional bad press for their stockholders.
0;Trash anticheat &gt proceeds to close openiv just because of the 'client side master race who gives a f of the server checks client is always right' mentality instead of making a better anticheat/or even simple server checks(like please you can just call the natives and without checking any data it just adds the value) &gt more $$Sadly thats not how it works.
0;The majority of my hours was spent playing with various single player mods thanks to openIV. Now it's all gone and its very sad how Rockstar/TakeTwo decided to remove any chances of modding. This game gets worse and worse with so many DLCs that are so expensive. It would be amazing for Rockstar to allow openIV to operate. For now rockstar i'm extremely dissapointed and I hope you do the right thing. OpenIV team stay strong you have the modding community by your side!! &lt 3
0;You ruined the mods that made this game so much more enjoyable to play! Yes I agree that online multiplayer cheating is bad but for the rest of us who use mods to make single player mode more enjoyable its frustrating annoying and in the end makes me not even want to buy another Rockstar game or anything associated with Take Two.
0;Grand Theft Auto crash edition. I have a descent computer but this game has crashed 5 times in two hours. I've adjusted the video settings to stupid low levels and the problem still persists. Until the game is stable it's no fun and nearly unplayable(thanks to no saves mid mission). Stick to the console version unless you enjoy playing the opening scene mulitple times ina row.
0;The game used to be really fun to play online. Then Rockstar started banning people who play legitimately and letting the script kiddies continue to play.Every new update to GTA online makes the game slightly worse instead of better and devs don't really fix any of the things that actually need to be fixed they just try to pander to the community that ruins your day if you try to have fun playing it.
0;Rockstar and take two make millions off this game yet have a garbage microtransaction online pay to win buisness model. Modders plauge the online like a cancer. Every lobby has a modder that just messes with you and makes the game unplayable all they care about is there online dlc which is used to milk the consumer dry and encourage you to buy sharkcards the microtransactions that give you money online its sick to see a beloved company like this turn to greed honestly f uck rockstar
0;Hackers are everywhere. Every single session I've joined has one and you can't do anything with even 1 around. They'll just kill everyone on the server endlessly. Online is terrible. Singleplayer is a far better experience for this game needs a few mods so you can access all the online content offline but you don't have to edit game files to do that.
0;I guess I'll jump on the hate bandwagon for now not just because take two killed development of openIV but because the gunrunning dlc is broken at the moment. If it nearly impossible to make any money or get any of the research unlocks without purchasing them.
0;Due to the recent actions of Take Two and Rockstar I am no longer supporting the two from today and in future releases unless they pull the cease and desist of OpenIV.Do not buy this game unless you want to support a corrupted company who hates modders.Petition https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;Until modding gets unbanned this game is Theres about a day's worth of content without mods multiplayer is filled with endless sticky bombs and cheaters and dlc does nothing but add more cars. Mods were the only thing that allowed people to have actual fun in this game. Clean up your ing act rockstar.
0;Jumping in at a later date due to all the fuss. But I do geninly belive that the multiplayer aspect of this game is well and truely screwed. To much content is locked behind an absurdly high Paywall including aspects of the game that make this both Pay to win and Pay to play. The singleplayer remains a truely solid game but with regards to GTA O the game is no longer fun to play.
0;Modding is what first got me interested in game development and fueled my passions to learn how to model and program back in the late 90's when game developers cared enough to give their own tools away along with documentation and the game. this t stance against modding severely disappointing and will affect my future decisions to purchase games from Rockstar/Take 2.
0;Rockstar is trying pretty hard to push online and their cash system to sell shark cards but at the same time they have given up moderation (it seems) of people modifying the game in online servers. A lot of people ruin the online experience for tons of people and Rockstar has made it clear that they don't have plans to improve single player. Love the game but it's getting longer and longer between when I boot it up.
0;First GTA Online becomes more of a cash cow than ever forcing you to either grind for literally weeks to get a decent amount of money or buy ridiculously expensive shark cards. Then the ban the OpenIV mod tool making a lot of mods impossible arguing that it supposedly affects multiplayer which I have yet to see happen. This is nothing short of a power grab by Take Two interactive.
0;Just bought the Warriors on PS4 and it lags like a in splitscreen to the point of being unplayable. Installed Manhunt recently game crashes at the first door interaction. Vice City and San Andreas are unplayable as well on PC. A lot of wasted money and time. These guys seriously lack pride and care for their games. Figured leaving a negative review here is the best thing I could do to hurt them back. And the modding cease and desist thing too I guess.
0;RIP OpenIV.Go to hell Take Two......................./ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...')......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...PC GAMING IS AGAINST YOU!!
0;I bought this game when it came out on PS3 because I just needed it on release. I bought it again for PC because It's PC! We buy things on the PC so we can tweak the game more to our liking enjoying much better hardware threfore better experience oh and mods.
0;this is a good game that i'd love to give a good rating to. however the developers are ruining their game by removing mod support. mods aren't cheating because they fix the game rather than exploiting the game. mods make the game more fun for a lot of people and rockstar doesn't care. I think that this game 100% deserves the mostly negative reviews because it's rediculous.
0;I am not playing or buying any more games made by rockstar or prublish by take two due to the open iv situation. Open IV has a feature that makes you have to download a .asi file so that the mods used will work. This .asi file disables going into GTA online. If research was done this would be know. So please stop targeting the singleplayer modders as they cause no harm.
0;I would say that at the moment this game is the best in the world. It is very awesome 11/10 also cheap during summer sale (36.99)*EDIT*Hehe 11/10 would not say it is the best in the world. Why get rid of free SINGLEPLAYER mods again oh yes money. The developer is as arrogant as Sony.
0;"""Banned singleplayer mods because it's """"competition"""" for your multiplayer even though the people with that do mod singleplayer probably play online on console. Also I've lost more than $1.5mil because of some ing rng it's great that you guys are taking intiative after the fact though. Great job Take Two you've on your own chest."""
0;Single player is okay though pretty lack luster compared to earlier titles.The multiplayer is a horrible horrendous grind. There is not a single way to make money at an acceptable rate. Content releases have been limited to PvP (which this game does not do well). Heists are fun but get old after the 200+ time and yet R* won't add more.
0;The online mode is full of hackers barely able to do something fun because of that i get randomly kicked from sessions that makes me impossible to play missions with friends and now you remove the mods. Well time to play something else than this game.
0;Banned for no reason... Seriously.. never buying another Rockstar game again..You can troll all you want but the truth is that i never loaded any mods or violated any of the rules listed. So frustrated that they reset everything on your online account... so yeah the game isnt great enough for me to go through it all over again... i hope everyone that works at Rockstar Games wakes up in the middle of the night to find their house on fire and all the doors locked mysteriously from the outside.
0;Single player was great but rockstar has abandoned it for the cash grab that is GTA Online. On top of this they are attacking their modding community and doing ablsolutely nothing about hackers. Online could be improved by a huge margin if they simply stop monetizing it this much and start banning hackers but that is not going to happen.
0;Probably the best PC port of a game in years. It can run on anything.Unfortunately the jews over at Taketwo interactive have made GTA Online a terrible experience. It's all shark cards and killing other players and doesn't leave much room for actual fun like in GTA IV multiplayer. Also going after mods was a ing stupid move you idiot jews. Do not buy this garbage pirate it.
0;well done Rockstar and T2 screwing over your customers . shame on you . modding cannot nor should not be banned. ..ever! its that community that help drive sales and kepp players returning and inspiring others to buy the game . so what if some are building cheats... its not real life its a fricken game...!!!!! you've already made millions on this game and micro transactions and still charging full price... you've got some neck on you to try pulling this stunt.
0;I've never seen a video game developer do anything so incredibly anti consumer. A huge reason for the continued replayability of this game is with mods and Take Two Interactive has completely sabatoged their own game. You could have worked with OpenIV or at least dictated boundaries but you've just gone and ruined everything. There are oil companies that I like more than you now.
0;"""you R* waiting for 2 years and what? A piece of I know the game s great but what s the y meaning of """"GTAV HAS STOPPED RUNNING""""? Not mention that AMD GRAPHICS has no Optimization. Why double GRAPHICS can't start GTAV? What the bloody PC you use to test this game? Why laptop can't open it? Pulled off so many times and what? You ruined a y good game! Though lots of bugs at least ACU could entre the game. If no patches for PC version then get lost and suck my R*."""
0;Take Two has banned any modding for this game and has gotten even greedier expecting you to pay for everything. Online is a complete joke with cheating and hacking. They are concerned with modding yet cannot fix the real problem which is online cheating.
0;Great game for the offline story mode. But unfortunately that's not why I bought this game I bought it for the online gameplay... And I got fu*ked. The online community in this game is trash full of hackers ready to ruin your day. You can try switching rooms only to find another hacker right around the corner. Ruined the game for me imo.
0;worst service ever..pre ordered 2 weeks early..still locked out of social club..never even got to play the game..never trust anything on steam..they deliberatly sell and promote games that they either know are full of cheaters or dont even work at all..total scam site..been using it for years and they are always stealing from people..i could tell you stories of their theivery that would curl your toes..buy nothing from steam
0;This game was great on PC thanks to mods. For multiplatform gamers that already had this game mods were the main reason for getting the PC version. Thanks to Take Two's policy on cracking down on mods I would NOT RECOMMEND. Also nobody can ensure that they will not push any more anti consumer practices and microtransactions.
0;Take 2. People work hard to create things like OpenIV whilst recieving no money doing so. When a large corporation like these bastards come along and ban peoples hard work it's disheartening to say the least. Just another example of a large company ing a small group of individuals. Long live the modding community x
0;I don't usually play GTA V but when I did play it the gaming experience compared to the previous game was spectacular. Unfortunately due to Take 2 removing the ability to mod this game and banning anyone who gets into an online lobby with a hacker is absoultly . How is it my fault I get into a game with a hacker ON YOUR OFFICIAL SERVERS? Terrible company. I will NEVRR support you unless you support the modders who keep your game alive and triving with new content. Good riddance.
0;I love this game I have over 700 hours just on PC not including all the time spend on the original release on xbox360. However if you take away the key ability that PC users have over console the ability to mod and customize single player parts of the game. I think that completely ruins the game. Because of this I would not support Rockstar games or Taketwo.
0;Edited The mod banning thing was a bummer... We used to meet up with all of my friends on the same session but there are some problems about that most of my friends have quitted the game because of that.. So many things need to be fixed before I could recommend this game.
0;Modders give up vast amounts of time and put in vast amounts of effort to improve the longevity of your game and ask nothing in return. You literally already make money for nothing from them and that STILL isn't enough.So on behalf of every modder you.And to every modder thank you for your hard work.
0;Grindy cashgrab. While the singleplayer is fun for a bit it dies pretty quickly leaving us with a mediocre online experience. I wouldn't recommend buying this game specially considering Take Two/Rockstar actions against the modding community recently. Just pirate it and play the singleplayer for some hours the multiplayer is a big pile of
0;Taking down mods in general was a bad idea T2 because of your incompetance to make a capable anticheat system for online you take down singleplayer's mods also !! i personally hate griefers in online i fully support taking down mod menus !! i personally bought the game twice only because of singleplayer mods and vehicle mods and such ... !! good job T2 You fu*k it up !!
0;YES buy this game if you do not play online mode and do single player only. The online mode is completely full of modders and peices of trash cheaters that totally ruin the online mode. Morton's gets all their salt from the online community for this game... people suck...
0;Rockstar and Take Two Interactive should be ashamed of their actions towards the OpenIV modding team and modders in general. Don't support companies that don't support their community. Anti consumer actions need to be fought in the only way money hungry tyrants like these understand By closing your wallet to them.
0;I enjoyed the game for a long time largely due to the offline modding. OpenIV only allowed users to mod offline. This will fix nothing but ruin everything. Enjoy having a game with no offline players and no online players because this will do nothing to stop the modding. P.S. your pay to play cash cards that led to many online modders to begin with.
0;Open IV DOES NOT SUPPORT GTA ONLINE MODS!Open IV has been shut down by Take two and this means they have disabled around half of the available GTA V single player mods. Their reasoning is that Open IV enables the creation of malicious GTA Online mods which is strictly NOT TRUE. Because of this I implore you to NOT buy GTA V until this issue is resolved and Open IV is restored.
0;Do not buy Take two interactive are greedy and spiteful they hit one of the biggest mods with a take down notice. This on its own wouldn't seem so bad however we all know the reason they are doing it is to force you to play the online aspects so they can ram more micro transactions down your throat. They think of us as purely cash cows and if you aren't willing to spend more money in their eyes you aren't even considered human ths company! save your cash and give it to someone more deserving
0;This game has more cheaters than any other game on the internet. People using God Mode Rockstar does nothing. People teleport to you while doing a VIP mission so they can kill you and steal your money Rockstar does nothing. People can exlpode an enitre lobby Rockstar does nothing. People spawn money to avoid buying in game currency BANNED! Do not buy and do not count on GTA6 getting it right. #PayTheBenz
0;This game is out on pc still one year and the online is still the same.....No new heists.Tons of loading times.Throws back to single player after every single setup.Cheaters everywhere.Updates are always the same (5 new cars thats all)Flying cars in every session.50% of the players still dont know how to play.
0;The only reason I got this game on PC was mods and you took that away Take Two. Thanks.I will say that I'm pretty sure Rockstar has cleared the problem but I leave my review as is to say F*#k Take Two. They tried to do a sh#%ty thing and didn't get away with it doesn't change the fact that they tried to do it.
0;"""Take Two """"Microtransactions from shark cards are making us more then most AAA games on release we're under charging customers! Now let's ban Single Player mods because modders are producing content for Single Player dear god people might play that instead of buying shark cards!"""""""
0;"""Oh yeah new """"free dlc"""" for gta online fly a mig would be nice. Free if you want to grind a ton of heist and activities. Missions were downgraded and offer less money than before they clearly want to get more money with micro transactions. No wonder there was no SP dlc coming out not worth it... greedy Rockstar."""
0;"""Bought 2 shark cards the 8 million dollar one when the summer sale was on but only got one of the purchase contacted rockstar and they said it was already in my account when it wasn't because it still comes up with the message """"Exceeded the daily purchase limit the money will be in your acount in 24 hours"""" it's been a week now and i would either like my money back or the money in game thanks for nothing tar"""
0;openiv is finally useable thanks to rockstar.Edit Now its time for all of us that have been falsely banned to get actual customer support. Mods are just a part of what we needed to fix. Remember FiveM the multiplayer mod. Well everyone who used FiveM has their Social Club account banned and you can't even play the story mode of the game because Social Club is the DRM. And many was falsely banned from the multiplayer and everyone can't do nothing about it.
0;What to say... GTA did a lot of things right in the single player but the multiplayer falls apart very quickly. An overabundance of hackers and basic human nature make it very adversarial when playing alone. In the same vein Rockstar has seemingly forgotten about story in favor of selling in game currency where the real money is. Also they and Take Two presume to not allow modding of the game which is the final straw.
0;I bought GTA 5 for the ability to mod the game and expand the horizons of a beautiful platform. To take that away from us after we pay sums of 100's in some case if simply ludicrus! Rockstar you need to rectify the mistake you made and admit you are wrong or it will be YOU that is sorry!
0;No more Offline modding no more Gta for me.Well done TT.Edit It seem to be fixed OpenIV is back up.But still the single player never received any content and the online feel like a cash grab with persistent million dollars vehicle upgrade houses and way more.Not for me anymore.This will stay down
0;Loved it then it got boring. Hackers left me to play solo in private matches which is fun for a WHILE. Nobody really interacts with eachother. Honestly this game is already slowly dying it gets repetetive and doesn't have much of a charm. Single player is beautiful with wildlife and more dense area's and whatnot. Multiplayer is just same old bland thing again. Buy it when it's on sale if you really want it that bad.
0;A great game made by great individuals who are passionate about their work.Sadly these individuals must work under a company I have come to hate.Hey T2 anti cheat isn't hard. Why don't you actually 'git gud' instead of sending a cease and desist to the modding community?
0;The direction of all online content needing to be played in public lobbies takes the enjoyment away for me. After a 77 000 signature petition and customer backlash R* and T2 did rescind their ban on single player mods. Thanks for that but the multiplayer still makes me feel the same as the first statement above...
0;I can't mod on single player no more. ( Take Two they just ruined GTA V......................./ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...')......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...
0;This game has become ing t. No New Heists in over 2 years Multiplayer grind is boring game is pay2progress as hell for a 60$ game No single player content addedRockstar has become thirsty as hell for the microtransaction money. Every update is mostly just more overpriced vehicles and items with boring modes that give breadcrumbs as a reward.
0;"""Gta Online has been ruined. Low Payouts Constant Pushing to Buy Shark Cards Everything is too expensive Higher Level Players can buy OP cars with guns and rocket launchers attached Hackers GaloreNot to mention that you can no longer mod the SINGLEPLAYER MODE because it is """"Breaking Copyright.""""Don't buy this game.If you want a genuine GTA experience play GTA 4 GTA SA or any other GTA game."""
0;Dear Take TwoThis game has been getting worse overtime by this I mean the online. First you make things almost impossible to buy unless you pay 85 pounds and even that doesn't last 5 minutes.And now you say that you're concerned about 'under monetising users'. This is the 4th best selling game of all time you've sold it 3 separate times.And now you're attacking mods did you see how well that went down with Skyrim? Good luck with that Take Two A very angry modder
0;this game used to be fun but now they are taking online accounts down for single player mods its total t the online section is fun but all the nice things are overwhelmingly expenisve so you have to end up buying shark cards but overall its a fun game
0;The only reason to purchase GTA on PC these days usually one year after it's already been out on consoles or even buy it a second time after you've had it on console for a year is to mod it and mess about.Now Take Two has decided it does not want it's game to be modded and give some silly reasons about messing up online games which are protected anyway. We don't believe you. So as much as I loved the GTA series I'm not going to bother in the future. I'll just wait and buy it second hand.
0;"""Singleplayer Its really good and fun given that its just you.Multiplayer A crash there getting killed here Ohh alot of money and last but the most (insert word) hackers.As of Smuggler's Run i got alot of my money """"stolen"""" by rockstar.Many other legite players had the same happen to them...Wtf rockstar?"""
0;Take Two Interactive is a awful company it's a shame GTA could be much better then what they' are if they listen to the players. Instead it's all about $ which guts any intrested I every had. I played every GTA and have been a fan about just about every game so it's a big SHAME. I wish ROCK STAR would take a more community diven approach to the way they make games like CS GO.
0;Never ever would I spend money on take two or rockstar ever again. I sunk so much money into shark cards and they stripped account of my money completely. They blatant thieves and clearly play the loopholes in the law to extort money from honest people.
0;loading times not skipable cutscenes indestructable objects (trees boxes etc) awful adversary mods(just take a look at bambooshka). Skill balancing doesnt work like it should you can have your avg team lvl 50 vs enemy team lvl 1 with team balancing enabled... now i start to understand cheaters they cheat just because they dont care. wouldnt recomend online but if u have spare money u can buy it because of single player story is great
0;If you wanna play this game for the online game i would not advice it. Rocket start has never managed to get there hackers out of the game and people only hack there .. its not fun and it is at this point unplayable because of all the hacking .. and if its not hackers you get server issues.Single player is ok .. but dont buy the game for multiplayer .. it is pointless
0;Good game at the begininng of it's life now it is way too grindy. Good story but if you are trying to play online don't buy it or just join modded lobbies for money because grinding is practically useless because hours of grinding will get you one of the million things that cost a ton. Also R* doesn't care about the people who play the game as their customer support is terrible and the game is a blatant cash grab.
0;They made it so you can't get money drops the grind isn't worth it. We need to fight together so we can have fun without the constant money grind. EDIT Also they did a massive banwave of innocent players and wiped a load of legit money I'll only respect Rockstar until they fix this crap.
0;Pros A lot of freedom A lot of things to doCons Social Club is garbage GTA Online is full of hackers GTA Online is full of bugs too GTA Online sending you to GTA V if your connection is lost instead of to homescreen.Overall fun game but terribly executed. Rockstar should fix a lot of stuff before releasing more.
0;publisher is effed eff Take Two. I'll be buying all Take Two products second hand or not buying them at all from here on out it's honestly pointless to have them able to connect to their online multiplayer because they've shown time and time again they're going to lock anything remotely good about it behind massive grinding or pay walls to encourage people to buy their micro transactions and will even eff over the best parts of their games mods to to do the same.
0;Rockstar has completley given up on the 'Online' portion of the game and is completetly overrun by cheaters (100% chance of cheaters every session). However they keep releasing DLC's as if that solves the problem.If you just want single player go for it. Rockstar flushed Online down the drain though. Should be $30 now since half the game doesn't function.
0;I like the game but isn't fun for long. mods increase the longevity and enjoy ability of the game. Take Two just wants money and hates the people who actually enjoy the game. It is safe to say I will never buy or even play another title that is in any way related to Take Two they do not deserve the support or players.
0;Solid singleplayer campaign. Grindy multiplayer everything makes you want to buy a Shark Card if you want to enjoy anything. (Oh and also playing alone sucks). I really hope they'll do a singleplayer DLC someday.I do not reccomend purchasing GTA V. If you did don't waste your money on Shark Cards and enjoy singleplayer with mods if you wish.
0;"""""""I'm sorry you've only got the fouth best selling game of all F*cking time . . ."""" OfficalNerdCubedI got Gta 5 on PC to mod and Take two just banned that. The ONLINE is nothing but a 'mirco' transaction hell hole and the only way to drive the new cars is there."""
0;After purchasing the pre order many months ago i am still unable to get my 360 account onto my steam account.After emailing their help staff (who were very helpful at the start) have seemed to push me aside probably relising ive purchased there game. thanks a lot rockstar for not treating people who have spent good money for your game who you are treating like scraps. It says on steam i've played gta v for 3 hours but i haven't even gotten past the social club menu screen.
0;I have to re write old review now and just say that I support OpenIV and that Take Two is making a grave mistake by essentially destroying modding for this community. If you think that we will be quiet that your company will slip away with a silent victory after this disservice to your dedicated fans...You. Are. Wrong.
0;After pulling finds from players not fixing any bugs and making it impossible to play the heists without getting aimbotted by the AI I had to write a review. Didnt work at launch Doesnt work now. Just a sad broken console port that no love went into developing. Just a money grab on a former beloved franchise. R.I.P Grand Theft Auto I will always hold your former games in my heart. Do not waste your money.
0;I doubt that open IV did anything bad and malicious your just preventing fun for us in single player and as much as i enjoy the game i hate the online and its based on In App Purchases which i hate a lot you are just making players play the online and the only way you can make it in the online without grinding for hours days and maybe weeks is to buy in game money and that is too expensive anyways besides your a too rich company anyways you dont even need any money
0;The online can be fun for a while with some of the new game modes you get some good gameplay hours out of it but it wasnt really for me . Modding is gone due OpenIV being shutdown but more than likely will not stop hakers and cheaters online. GTA modding is my reason for buying and I'm not the only one if you look at other recent reviews. Mods will be missed this game was fun while it lasted. Last gta for me and Modders thanks for all your work! haha
0;I dont care about the mods thing. The matchmaking in this game is horrible. ing hours spent trying to get people together to do missions or heists most of the time they drop out or just leave after the first fail. I want to spend my time playing not looking at a god damn lobby menu.
0;Do NOT buy this game !!! Even if you decide that mods is no big deal for you rockstar will destroy your game i just lose 1.45 millions dollars from hard work as a CEO because rockstar think that money was modded i work hard to buy the new flying motorbike and now i got no motorbike and 0 money after tons of hours spend. AGAIN i was a big fan of GTA online but rockstar just suck. So STAY AWAY unless you want to spent hours for nothing !
0;So let me review this game again.. Rockstar has started a ban wave to hackers including innocent players so what is happening is hacker seller are making even more extreme hacks that is very undetected and people are just getting banned for no reason including the innocent players... I don't get the logic on that....
0;ROCKSTAR RETURN MY CASH!!!I wasn't use any MOD in Online I entered to a session that someone using mod to get money his mod effect all player in the session. I think I got 40 000 000$. However in the latest update you rockstar adjust my account include my own money about $500 000 to 0!ZERO! WTF IS GOING ON I AM GOING TO SUE YOU MADAFAKA !
0;Game is crap without OpenIV for modding let us all never buy Rockstar's crappy games again... lest this travesty repeats itself once they have our money then screw us over the next time by removing mods again from their next pay 2 win franchise since all they want is money.
0;Loved the game before when modding was possible and playing online was fun.Now I've been banned (yes I did deserve it) on online but that didn't really matter to me.What does matter is that OpenIV has been shut down by taketwo screw you guys. I ain't touching GTA till OpenIV is back.
0;oh whats this? a lot of people are using OpenIV for single player mods to get vehicles that we only have in Online so people will spend more money on our shark cards which? Most multiplayer mods dont use OpenIV? BAN OPENIV! ITS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE INSTEAD OF SPENDING MONEY ENHANCING THE GAMES MULTIPLAYER CHEAT DETECTION!
0;Downvoting this game because of shady and greedy practices of Take Two and Rockstar Games namely banning modding as a way to squeeze additional money from Shark Cards (microtransactions). This is an obvious next step of milking the game industry.Aside this fact the game in terms of singleplayer is pure excellence.
0;Game might be fun to play but when you realize how much time you spend on it and one day you log in to realize you are permanently banned you suddenly dont wanna do anything with this game and I will never buy another rockstar game ever again. No matter how good the game is. just aint worth it.And by reading recent reveiws i can tell im not the only one so multiplayer must be gettin pretty empty nowdays. game died just like CoD. aint the same anymore
0;"""BANNED FOR NO REASON!!! no sqeaking hacking or modding. I just logged in one day and BOOM banned for 30 days. So im like okk sure i did nothing wrong let me just wait it out (WHich felt like forever tbh) 30 days later i get unbanned and play gtao for five days before getting permabanned. Called Rockstar. """"All bans are final and may not be appealed"""" Searched what might've gotten me banned. No luck. Please guys stick to single player. Online is terribleSingle Player 10/10Online 1/10"""
0;I can't recommend this game because it only delivers half of what it promises. Single player is a joy but multiplayer is a nightmare due to awful UI terrible matchmaking rampant hackers bugs and crashes make it unplayable.Seriously the worst anti cheat I've ever encountered. 5/10
0;A great game marred by a poor publisher. Take Two banning modding in the game even for Single Player where it doesn't affect online play is terrible.They still have not fixed the multiplayer cheating issue so instead they go after single player only modifications? I do not recommend this game or any game published by Take Two. You will never get my money again until you reverse this decision on modding.
0;A terribly optimised pathetic excuse for a game. Just reinforces the idea that Rockstar doesn't care about the PC world anymore. Load up the game CrashLoad up custom radio micro stutterDrive too fast driving on airAuto save on GTA Online Server disconnectionOn the plus side Rockstar censored their name on the in game chat so you don't have to read their name.
0;"""Rockstar and T2 be like """"Cheaters hackers griefers terrible servers that keep making you disconnect nearly every half an hour ? Nah Imma sleep. Mods that help create more contents for people to enjoy the game and help YouTubers make money ? Real sh!t ban it right away !"""""""
0;Good game it would be perfect if R* accept mod in game. Image Dayz for GTA V one day...P/s I changed my review from positive to negative after 2 years of having this game due to the act on discontinuing OpenIV of Taketwo. It sorely affecting to Singleplayer only player like me.
0;Story mode is nice gmaplay its good used to have mods now its gone which means the game is less exciting to play because taek two ed it all uponline prices too high unbalcend DLCs buggy as heck now small lobbys which arnt fun to play in less point in onlinethis is the most comman things i hear from others so ill give it in a big mashup of a review
0;Was a great first player game but its lost all of its good reputation due to rockstars terible anti consumer and gaming community tactics. With the scrapping of singleplayer dlc for adding more useless fluff to online scamming people out of real money. And now recently taking down openiv the only thing thats been adding longevity to keep playing the game.
0;TakeTwo makes single player mods illegal and kills OpenIV until they allow mods for single player I will never buy another R* or TakeTwo game again. Thier actions did not and will not stop online cheating. Do not support developers or a company that does this! If you really want to play the game then pirate it! Modding in single player is why I bought this for PC.
0;ROCKSTAR/TakeTwo are a bunch of greedy pigsThe developer of this game actively destroyes modding communities and modding as a whole as means to push their in game purchases.Last month the company sent out cease and desists to all major modders of this game effectively destroying mods in this game.DO NOT support this company with your purchase.
0;Right down the line Its really disgusting how GTA V is treating it's community. A great Pity. Take Two.. you are ruining the players fun at playing this game its just obvious how you are grinding the last penny out of this game. The playerbase is hopefully going to shrink. Pay to win has finally taken over our loved GTA.Im currently not recommending to play GTA V &amp GTA V Online
0;"""Take 2 and Rockstar are money grabbing steaming piles of crap.* lobby system* Unreliable servers* Long load times even on the fastest storage available to man* They only care about hackers if they're no longer making money off of you* """"Shark Cards"""""""
0;i have way more hours combined on PS3 I have a play time of 16days 14hours other than a few modders online game is still fun. Not Recomended now the game should of have a free 4 all in the online No ranks No Bans Mods allowed because this game is really fun with mods.
0;Sending a cease and desist to the most influential mod group to exist that brought MILLIONS of players to your games is inhumane and down right dumb. They didn't violate any of your rules the users of the mod did. You have seen what the backfire of your decision was and I hope you can fix that soon. Touchy!
0;I have bought this game now for the third time. Never have been into playing it online and only purchased this game for the pc mods. Otherwise I would just keep playing it on the ps4. It's a damn shame that 2k and Rockstar have turned their backs on the community. Great game but I feel like I am an idiot for buying the PC game.
0;Ever since this game came out on consoles its been nothing but errors. the long awaited online play then the year and a half wait for heists which they kept saying would happen in a month and now that i try to play it on the computer what do i find? more errors. Bought the game and cant even play it because its stuck in offline mode. ive never logged in before so it tells me i need to go online first. rockstar get your together. $60 for an unplayable game. woo!
0;DO NOT GET ANY SHARK CARDS WITH BONUS BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY OF THE BONUS!My problem is with customer support and them lying about the shark card bonus they offered which I bought the $99 shark card to get the massive bonus and I never saw 1 cent of it and never had any of my emails replied to. The bonus was the biggest scam a game ever ran that I know of. That being said the game is fun and the graphics are awesome.
0;No more modding? No more mooney for Take Two. I played this on PS4 then bought it AGAIN through Steam because of the fantastic mod scene. But no more. Take Two can stuff it. And they still have the nerve to charge $60 for this title. Why do they think people will still buy it for this price? Guess what. It's because of all the crazy mods.Take Two...You're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
0;"""On top of Take Two's decision to get rid of modding in singleplayer """"to get rid of hacking in multiplayer"""" they have been squeezing as much money out of the GTA community. They do this instead of make the game better which should not be acceptable from any developer or publisher."""
0;Everybody bought this game on PS3 and Xbox 360. Then they bought it again for PC for the mods. Take 2 decides that modding is wrong most likely because they think the people who are modding in multiplayer locked vehicles instead of paying 60 quid for them. Apparatnly buying a game twice is not good enough for these greedy s and playing said game without paying them more is out of the question.
0;it is an ok game except.... for... the.... constant... loading... join race... load... wait in lobby... load... pick your car and place your bets... load... finish... load... deathmatch... wait in lobby.... load... finish... load... mission... lobby... load... finish... load... lots and lots of loading screen wait time.after rockstar's continuing rapacious greed I GIVE THE DOWN THUMB.Latest update hasn't fixed long standing.... annoyances (not really bugs but bad UI/UX)
0;Why this unvote? well because every time i finish a mission loading screen took forever to load then restart the game open the game loading screen took forever again whose not gonna get mad with that and this problem has been happening for 2 years now and still no solution. thats why
0;this game is riddled with hackers glitches and horrifc amount of broken content and issues. i do not recommend this game to anyone who is not prepared for endless hours of sitting around in online for people to join and randomly disconnect especially in heists which need 4 people to play and are extremely unstable.
0;The highly anticipated grand theft auto v. everyone i've met who uses consoles loves to rub it in PC's face that they got GTA V way before us. After playing 100+ hours I can assure you that we were not missing out on anything. This game has huge capabilities and a giant map but you can barely do anything on this map. I cant believe rockstar pulled this
0;Let's start with the online it's just a cash grab for rockstar the missions barely payout new dlc's content costs millions which is extremely hard to get without the shark cards and recently they started shutting down mods so if people want to try online features they have to grind for days on end with online mode.
0;I have a ton of hours in this game. Very good single player. REALLY bad multiplayer its a pay to win microtransaction ridden hellhole that doesn t let you do anythin. and the mods are big part of why i love this game. But they just went and destroyed that too. Not supporting take two again in my life unless they fix this toss up.
0;Product received for free. Rockstar doesn't care make a way to report hackers that's not useless. And maybe make it so a full lobby discovers that before it freaking despawns you I've had my fair share of fun with this game but it's a complete headache even when you have a dedicated group of friends to play with
0;This game does not support the customer base. I do not recommend the game because No modding support and active suppression of the modder community Many cheaters impossible to play legitimately No moderation the best way to play is by making private lobbies with people you know so you don't get bothered
0;Don't buy this game. Online is full of hackers that they don't care about. SP is fun but after that it gets NO attention from Rockstar at all. Really fun game ruined by their Online Crap. I know their new update looks fun and all but its VERY expensive in game and unless you are willing to drop 100+ dollars on shark cards. It'll be a long while until you can afford thsoe cars. Just don't buy this game.
0;While I loved the game single player content is never added by R* and the only way to add in new cars etc has now been removed so they can try to grab more money from online which is absolute garbage. Taketwo Bring back OpenIV and maybe you will get good reviews again.
0;You messed it up now Take Two. I love this game. Why? Not because of the awful multiplayer. For the singleplayer. For the ability to customize and play the game the way I wanted to. Now you send a C&amp D to the biggest mod community that is HELPING prolong the games life. What a horriblle move on your part. I have 316 hours in this game. From singleplayer. having loads of fun. And you've taken it all away. For those that don't know. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_ok
0;Boycott this game. they do not respect customers. all they want to sell is cash cards. while destroying anything good in single player. no new cars etc in single player. everything is on online is ing expensive as want a car? pay 1m. want a heli? pay 3m. want a plane? pay 15m!!!!! and you cant enjoy making money doing 15 min mission which barely pay 20k..
0;This is somewhat of a good game. It makes great use of the GPU and utilizes SLI well. The updates from rockstar ruin the game. Every time there is an update I have to tweak the files and change every setting. Rockstar breaks this game constantly. The disk version is just as bad. If you can navigate around the monthly updates you will good to go. If not be prepared for a constant headache while playing the game.
0;One of the greatest multiplayer games to ever exist. But one of the main reasons I bought this game when it first came out was how great the mod community of gtaIV was and the hope of that someday transferring to the great new GTAV. Unfortunately after two years it has only stepped up its anti modding policies.
0;Take Two killed the main modding platform for this game which only altered single player content in an attempt to generate more revenue through GTA O microtransactions. They literally killed the single player modding one of the very few reasons people even bought this on PC to push GTA O and their own agenda. And since a lot of things are extremely hard to obtain in GTA O this is akin to forcing people to buy in game currency. Unbelievable.
0;Good optimization new content monthly good gameEdit 2017 Very big mistake from Take Two to ban modding. Banning is not a way to stop competition (i'm talking about fivem and gt mp) I think the community is more important than making MORE and MORE money from this game.. I will uninstal this game for a time... RIP GTA
0;This game is trash with out single player mods. I wouldnt recomend this game anymore until take 2 changes the views on single player mods. Gta 5 is now garbage since take 2 let their greed run wild. Do not buy this game or play it online lets hurt take 2 in their wallet books!!!!
0;Game full of loadings and full of bugs 80% of time in loading screens. This when you can access the rockstar network because it disconects you from that network all the time and you can't play online if you are not connected to rockstar! the game itself is awesome one of the best i've played.
0;"""Everybody knows you never go full retard. Getting rid of a few pay to use online exploit tools not just slow. Getting rid of singleplayer mods... . You went full retard Take Two. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn 2001 """"I Am Sam."""" Remember? Went full retard went home empty handed..."""
0;It may be a bloated loading simulator with bunch of kids killing each other 24/7 but it has lots of things to do and plenty of glitches and that's what makes it so great. The story mode is made great by installing all the mods you can.Edit Take Two s over OpenIV a singleplayer mod for no reason. Look at your reviews now dumbasses.
0;Only reason I even could even buy things on GTA Online was because of hackers giving me money. Otherwise prepare to spend a lot of money on shark cards. microtransactions. Do not play for multiplayer unless playing with friends. Just mod the single pla...oh wait...Take Two is taking down mods? Don't support that trash company.
0;Banned mods so they would force people to go into online and either grind for a billion hours or take the easy way and buy shark cards to get the new items and vehicles. Greedy bastards. Guess earning half a billion dollars in sales just wasn't enough.
0;Take Two Interactive is making ILLEGAL to mod this game and DESTROYING it for the Players. GTA 5 is a game that has a HUGE Potential and that potential can only be unlocked with mods. T2 are making it Pointless to play at all They are a bunch of greedy Scumbags that ONLY care about MONEY!
0;BIG GTA FAN HERE BUT YOU TAKE 2 INSTEAD OF MAKING DEDICATED SERVERS SO WE ALL HAVE GOOD CONNECTION AND BANING CHEATERS WITH VAC OR BATTLEEYE YOU GO AFTER MODERS! BEEN MODING SINCE GTA VC AND YOU WANT TO SHUT US DOWN?? YOU TAKE 2! YOU AND YOUR SHARK CARDS!

I have folowed all the instructions but still none of the solutions work . I have checked rockstar support but it was as useful as the others.

0;its a piece of online sucks because it takes 5 in years to load and then 5 mroe years to load you into an online session and if you cant connect to that session 5 mroe years. its liek the american justice system. also you get banned for having mods. 10/10. jk thsi game in sucks singleplayer is good tho.
0;Single player is fun but the multiplayer absolutely ruins the game. It's filled with hackers and microtransactions up the butt. Plus 3/4 times I try to connect it just says error and sends me back to tsingle player mode. On top of all that rockstar felt the need to bring back Social Club their cancerous launcher that always fails to connect and is absolutely pointless. Save your money.
0;I'm just getting in on this GTA Online/ Take Two/ Rockstarr hate after that cease and desist was sent out. microtransactions and Take Two's attack on the modding community. I don't play GTA Online much anyway I much prefer single player. While I have never personally used mods watching videos of modded games on Youtube has given me some pretty good laughs so once again Take Two.
0;"""We DO NOT USE OpenIV for modding on multiplayer. U do this bcoz u cant handle the amount of hacker on the gta online RIGHT ?!. it means U CANT MAKE A BETTER ANTICHEAT LIKE VAC DID. U JUST CANT! . thats why u dont allow us to mod again. what r thoose money for that we paid if u cant even still make a better anticheat. SO MAKE A BETTER ONE AND ALLOW US TO KEEP MODDING ON A """"SINGLE PLAYER"""""""
0;So you release a game that took years to fix years after it released on console then you lock anything that's decent behind such an expensive pay/grindwall that it makes an Online DLC update 6x as expensive as the base game. No.Add to that the current Cease to Resist notices to all who keep the game alive in Singleplayer and you have yourself a freshly converted neg review.
0;Grand Theft Auto V was a good edition to the PC market. However it came out two years later than it should have. This game was fun for a while. The Campaine is good but lacking in choice. The Multiplayer is lacking in general not much to do but murder people.Simply the fact the Rockstar has shut down multiply modding projects for GTAV makes me feel that they no longer respect the community.
0;I Played the game for a bit. I modded on online. Was banned for two weeks. No big deal. A week after I'm unbanned I get banned for a month. For no reason at all. I wait the month out and the day after I'm unbanned guess what. I'm permanently banned. Do not buy. Rockstar are absolute crooks and only car about money.
0;Take Two Interactive has decided to go down a path that would ruin the modding community. A big part of why I purchased GTA V was so I would be able to modify the game in Story Mode to make the game more interesting and to not be stuck with content soley brought to us by Rockstar. Unfortunately I was compelled to write this review today and will no longer support the Grand Theft Auto series until they end this war that they've raged on the modding community.
0;OpenIV...Cant group up with friends and search for a game online like wtfThe grind for money online is not fun and online without money (cool cars etc) is not as fun it could be. Shark Cards...lolSign this petition please https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv &lt 3
0;GTA Online is no longer a fun open world crime simulator it's become a money centerd mode where if you don't manage to obtain money you have two options Grind business for hours on end or buy shark cards. This is the dilemma of Rockstar here they cared about shark card money so much they have practically removed modding from the PC version through OpenIV modding is a major benefit to this community and Take Two has removed it.
0;The Definitive open world experience... RUINED BY CORPORATE NUMPTYS WHO SINGLE HANDEDLY DESTROYED THE GTA V MODDING SCENE. I'm sure many like myself bought the game on PC (and subsequently pumped hours upon hours of playtime into it) purely because of the widely available OPENIV mod that has done far more to improve the shelf life of the game that sh**ty car updates to the broken rancid online. 0/10 (until the Take2 VS OpenIV issue is resolved)
0;I would politely ask that Take Two or Rockstar change their policy towards modding. I had already bought this game on XBox and only bought the PC version for its modding. In fact should I be asking for a refund?First negative review posted. You're welcome Take Two.
0;I really enjoyed this game I even bought some money for it at the beginning. But then the microtransactions kept coming and never stopped. They added so much stuff locked behind either 50 hours of playtime to get one car or 50 dollars for it. AND NOW they've attacked the modded scene which was the only way I could ever play with their damned new cars and jets cause they don't put that in singleplayer! Don't waste your money on supporting these guys.
0;With a large highly detailed world and a large selection vehicles. GTA has much to do. Play it for the campaign ONLY. Online Mode is a complete mess. Full of Hackers/Modders that will go out of thier way to break your game and the PVP is very unbalanced. You will have a very hard time as a new player.
0;Rockstar... Bans with no reason support totaly doesnt care about players bots are answering u when u create a ticket. This is not how big company should treat paying customers. If you want to buy this game because of multiplayer dont u will get ban just because some random moder was playing on your server or u had some other app running like TS...If u want single player... well u dont need to buy it ) Rockstar totaly doesnt deserve that money!
0;Bring back mods in SP Rockstar! Talk to your head honchos at take two and explain to them what they re effectively doing to your community! Until it changes my little mark of an review stays negative here on steam. I do not support toxic behavior against the community. Your game has been out since 2013 without mods this game would not have close to half the population of daily user base in 2017.
0;Used to be a good game. Now rockstar/take 2 are trying to get all the money out if it they can by making it so you can't do anything fun online without buying in game money and they are trying to kill all mod support for the single player to try and get more people to play multilayer and buy money.TRDTake 2 killing off moddingsingle player receives no support from rockstar since initial release besides moddingMultiplayer exists only to try to get you to buy microtransactions
0;Great story but I can't support a game with this many microtransactions anymore and the ability to play singleplayer mods have been taken away which doesn't make sense.Thought you'd be the only developer not to do this Rockstar now you deserve this negativity.
0;The Only game i have ever played that kicks me out of public lobbies after 2 minutes...Not my ISP.. Not my computer.. not anything on my end... All the Ports are open and everything lets GTA through...Yet every time i try to play with friends online I get Dropped to a room by myself...Rockstar Says its on my end... NOPE... Its on thre end...
0;To hell with T2 they ruined the reason why people like me who had the game on console switched over to PC.. Mods... We paid for the f****** game! Let us do what we want to it. Yeah I understand online n' shi* but single player?Should you buy thig game??Uhh I think the not...
0;All of the mods... gone. All my money... gone. All my respect... gone. Your game in debt... done.You just ruined the best part of PC gaming modding and if this was your tactic all alone to get rid of mods then take the third one. Take Two Interactive no one bought this game on PC to play your money horing multiplayer we bought it to mod there goes the PC community there goes our respect for you taking down OpenIV.
0;Brought PC version after buying 3 previous versions (X360 XOne PS4) simply to be able to use Mods.Take2 you have destroyed multiplayer with Microtransactions and have officially killed off single player on PC by threatening OpenIV.Money grabbing bastards.0/10 Would rather be fisted by Big Smoke than ever purchase another Take2 game.
0;This is a review for the Finance and Felony DLC . My three friends and I spent 15 hours to fill a large warehouse when we go to sell it we had to fly a titan very very low and make 10 drops in 30 mins . Our pilot ( the CEO ) crash the plane on the second drop . So 15 hours and alot of money gone !!! Until the devs change the selling it is so not worth it to become a CEO DO NOT spend all that GTA money !!!! I'm glad I have not drop my GTA money in this money pit .
0;Latest update has ruined GTA by making every single utter now have a really easy way to really ruin your entire day. Just play the story mode and hope they make special cargo doable in private sessions or it is literally worthless pointless and ruinous.
0;"""This game is a good game its just Take Two that have made this review a negative one. Take Two have sent a cease and desist to the biggest mod for all GTA games just so they can profit from the multiplayer. To quote NerdCubed """"I'm sorry you only have billions instead of trillions"""""""
0;It's a good game but even better if you have friends to play this with.Edit okay im gonna change my review. The amount of modders every session is just crazy. Online is just unplayable you can't do jobs because of these lowlife s blowing you up all the time and sending cops literally spawning cops behind you and kills you.
0;i enojy the game but i was recently thinking of doing a bit of modding to stretch out my enjoyment of it and maybe play a cop like i've wanted to do since gta 3 but for some ing reason rockstar and take two won't give us that ability. Enter the modders. Well all that's a thinkg of the past because Take Two needs more than 3 400 million off a single game. Gredy
0;RIP OPENIV AND FU*K TAKE TWO I WILL NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN UNTIL YOU BACK TRACK ON YOUR STUPID DECISION SHAME ON YOU ROCKSTAR FOR ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN YOU GUYS SOLD OUT TO A COMPANY WHO ARE JUST CAPITALISING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH GTA V
0;Know what makes the Witcher such a great serie? Because Projeck Red allows modding and even encourages it. Know what makes GTA V Producers suck? The fact that they think mods should be illegal. I have lost respect for you as a company Rockstar. You've failed.
0;Well done Rockstar and Take Two for removing the only thing myself and a lot of other players used to have fun playing your game causing no harm to anyone else. Open IV and mods were the only thing keeping GTA V alive for me and without them its dead since GTA Online is a money grab.NO FUN ALLOWED!
0;Take two obviously don't consider the PC community to be valuable to them (probably because 90% of us don't play the game online so as a result don't buy shark cards) In banning Mods within a week it's gotten 47000 negative reviews! that's 47000 customers lost at this pointwell done you utter bellends
0;If i could request a refund i would. I bought this game for the mods. The fact that they probably want you to pay for mods is so ing snakeish. SO you ban mods? i dont think you remember what happended last time someone tried to mess with community modding. So buckle up rockstar. you didnt want to loose money? guess what? Its way too late for that. Rest in peace gta5
0;Another greedy company trying to ban something that improves player's experience in order to maintain their income from their alienated shark card buyers.They allowed the mod to operate again. But i will still leave a negative review just so the company thinks before they actually do anything.
0;good game and i recommand it ! that was..... 2 yars ago )) ... now... online .... jesus you cannot enjoy it... in 1 or 2 hours some modder gonna kill you.. you cargo ...and make you lose a lot of your work... not Worth it... NEVER AGAIN gonna buy ROCKSTAR !!!! no mather what game they gonna make... just by principle i will not buy any nomather what you telling me you make MILLIONS of dollars with this game.. but you are not willing to invest some money in it's security ? it's a joke
0;"""I used to love gta 5 but Take 2 did it for the modders. Rockstar says """"Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody."""" There is proof that when you mod and try to join online the game states """"You are trying to join online with an altered game"""" Rockstar is wrong and they know it. For the makers of openiv i hope someone will change their mind."""
0;I Loved this game from the day it came out but when it came out the experiance got worse and worse. like I had GTA lonline and i got hacked and had millions of dolloars and got perm banned for something I didn't do. then I started useing the single player mods and that is now all gone. So I am not happy with buying this game and I just uninstalled it because It just pisses me off what Rockstar did to all of us and my online account.
0;Thank you Rockstar thank you for ruining a saga thank you for ignoring all your customers thank you for defrauding all the people who made you great more than a decade ago. Now I know that i am not going to buy any other Rockstar game even I know you don't care because you have already sold to people like me more than 500$ in games and that is exactly what you have shown us we don't care only money does. THANK YOU.
0;Fun game but the anti cheat is a joke and hackers are everywhere. Singleplayer is fun with mods but online play has many problems. I would reccomend this game for SINGLEPLAYER and only if it's on sale. 6 15 2017 Now you can't even mod the singleplayer.7 11 2017 Modding seems to be ok but my original point still stands. Online is grindy as .
0;"""After reading comments you guys are right. Take Two has ruined their own reputation by attempting to shutdown OpenIV. Whether they apologize or not it still happened and that should never be forgotten. Modding will never die no matter how hard you stomp on it. The haters are right too. """"This isn't a legit review it's abusing the review system."""" Fine. online multiplayer was wreathed in so many microtransactions that GTA Online has become much less enjoyable"""
0;Mods make this game worth the price all over again. 11/10 would throw 747's at police again.UPDATE F**K YOU T2. It's bad enough that you guys made the Online stuff overpriced but now you're trying to force us into Online by destroying single player? Greedy .
0;"""So Take Two decided to kill OpenIV to """"curb cheating"""" when the software devs did its utmost best to make sure mods made through OpenIV could not work online but only in the solo mode. OpenIV has been here since around 2008 with GTA IV and has been a staple of the GTA Modding community since. Most mods use OpenIV to work and it is a useful tool to make them as well.So yeah Take Two Rockstar i'm boycotting all their games now"""
0;The single player is excellent with mods. Without not so much so. If OpenIV is truly against Take2's wishes for the game than I'll have to ask that you don't purchase the game and use mods. For them. It's what they want. Unfortunatly I can't recomend the game on just its own merits and especially on the merits of the unmodded multiplayer being a massive grind where the people with wallets to feed to T2 can ROFL stomp everyone that hasn't spent hundreds of hours of grind.
0;Just to big for ya boots T2 Interactive.Get over ya selfs these Modders are selling games for you especially for the single player which as of now has no new content released worth mentioning... But that MP loads of stuff gotta gem them shark cards all around. get over your selfs.$700m last year alone made from online transactions was this not enough for you.Disgusting actionsF**k You
0;Where to begin? It's GTA. An awesome game in both Multiplayer and Singleplayer. However due to the last developments envolving those f*** A**** in Take Two Interactive the modding community was damaged and severly impaired. RIP OPEN IV you guys made gaming even more fun! Hope the A*** at Take Two realize how bad they F*** up... Sorry for the language but this realy pisses me off...
0;Do not buy this game. Take TwoInteractive is screwing over the entire modding community by sending a C&amp D to the OpenIV modding software company. After only 100 hours in this game modding is basically the only thing that would bring me back to it. If you're looking for a game that you can play and be happy with for a good amount of time GTA V is NOT worth buying especially for the $70 price tag (considering this game is almost 4 years old).
0;this game the detail the scenery the work they put into this game is so wowupdate GTA V is an amazing game but rockstar keep updating their game and ruin mods. You have to update scriphook and keep figure out which mod is incompatible with the updateVery annoying because you don't have the option to stop them. But aside from that this is an amazing game.
0;This is the first time ever writing a review. i never modded this game but didnt mind the modders in fact it was always satisfing killing them when you could. and there wouldnt be many modders if the stupid cash cards werent so expensive. 99$ for 8 000 000 is ridiculous. everything is too expesive i online.. 
0;this game is great i love it but having it after almost a year my game does not want to work right what i mean is this is unplayable for me i get random crashes frequently and i dont know how to solve my issue if any1 can help i'd really be happy. until then probably wont play for a long time which makes me mad and sad (
0;Take Two Interactive sent a cease and desist notice to Open IV because they said some people could use it to mod in money on GTA Online. As if being one of the top selling games on Steam wasn't enough they did it solely because they want us to buy even more of their Shark Cards. In turn now the ability to have singleplayer mods has been brutally murdered in cold blood due to their insatiable greed. How can we stand for this type of injustice? #ModLivesMatter
0;It's a beutiful game with a good story. That's where the positives end. After the 5 10 hours or so of story it gets boring. Really really boring. I used mods to take advantage of the beutiful game and make it fun again but now I can't do that. Probably the worst decision a publisher has made in a long time.
0;Completely ridiculous. You send a cease and desist to a group that only tries to add value to the game via comunity led modding and you do this all because you want to make more money from in game micro transactions? If you do this with more games you're just going to lose money. Completely stupid idea.
0;"""The game has been taken over by hackers and ruined by a company now obsessed with microtransactions. All the new """"free"""" DLC is overpriced gimmicks designed to drive the purchase of in game money with RL cash and that supercar you bought for way too much will likely be outmatched by the one in the next release. No new singleplayer content since 2015 either.A lot of good mechanics and a great graphics engine gone to waste because of greed."""
0;The PC port of the award winning title. Not much to say honestly. An amazing story with a detailed world. Fun to play with an amazing original score along with great radio tracks. Customization is moderate in single and pretty darn good online. The Online mode though is just one that keeps giving and giving and giving for free. 5/5EDIT 6/22/17 Take Two. No fun allowed.

0;Take two is plain garbage They couldn't make any content in 2 years 3 1/2 if you add consol. All they release is cash grab cosmetic car that get more and more pricy while still having to do the same exact mission for 2 years to get some money...Their pay to play system is garbage coming from a garbage company.I liked it at first really liked it but now I've been deceived by how little concern they have for what players want and only listen to money even if it's hurt player base.
0;Product received for free. Rockstar fraud people i bough in game money with real money and i dint used it but the day of the expansionj my cash was gone and Rockstar refuse to refund me ... i don't recommend the game they literaly stole people and dont refund even if it's their faultI can see people cry about the fact that they can't modd the game wtf idiots modding it's hacking don't cry because you put yourself in trouble
0;The only reason I purchased this game on the PC eventhough I already had two other copies for XBox and XBone was to use its mods. Now thats gone. In what I am taking as an attempt to get more people to join the multiplayer Take Two had destroyed the Gta modding community and there is no way I am going over to that toxic community only to grind for hours or pay $70 more of my own money in order to be able purcahse the cheepest house on the map and a semi decent car.
0;This game is totally unfun in multiplayer and that's what it pushes you towards with Take Two Interactive doing everything they can to make the singleplayer even less fun for example issuing a cease and desist on a huge singleplayer mod platform basically disabling most mods. Absolutely consumer unfriendly behavior. Just look at the microtransactions for multiplayer and the grind if you want to avoid them.
0;Take Two ed over the OpenIV team a mod team that helped create so many mods for a decade now by threatening legal action on them. If you are going to buy this game dont wait until they reverse this absolute t. Its ironic though T2 allows a bunch of chuckle dickwads to run around their game hacking until the sun comes up and doesnt give two but as soon as someone actually creates something really amazing it gets shutdown immediately. Absolute retardation
0;I would've recommand this game if it aren't take 2 anti consumer and anti modding policies which is complete bullsh*t! Even if we can complain all we want is not gonna change anything because of consoles and kiddies this is unacceptable and greedy on every side of the spectrum they totally forgot what gta was all about and why it sold a lot on pc.
0;I ed you Take Two &amp RockstarYou canceled1. RDR map in GTA V2. Five M and other role play projects for GTA V3. Open IV 4. And part time Liberty City in V (which I was waiting strongly for)I always had a better opinion of you. I know that my review will not change anything. But I will say one thing you do not value someone else's labour.We loving you open IV team. Rest In Peace.GO YOUSELF STRAUS ZELNIK! GO YOUSELF T2 AND ROCKSTAR!#BringBackOpenIV
0;At release it was amazing. Now it's a micro transaction ridden hell hole. It's really sad honestly i could pop in and have a good time. But they've said you to the playerbase and R* continue to shove micro transactions down your throat. That cant stand.
0;"""Take Two killed the SP modding.Great game and worth every penny. Some people are having trouble running it but I think most of that is their rig so ignore those bad reviews. Ignore the haters!

0;WOW HAS MY REVIEW CHANGED &gt refuse to add single player content&gt ban mods that add single player contentwtf were they thinking? rip that sweet user review rating. Below is my original rating of the game from 2015...ORIGINAL REVIEW The wait to purchase this game on PC was totally worth it. The graphics are great but that also means it needs a good pc to run. If you havent played this game on the consoles yet this is a no brainer
0;This new update sucks so much it's got sweet cars and all but when all Rockstar wants is for people to buy the stupid Shark Cards it completely ruins the fun of the game. If you don't want to buy shark cards well good luck to you you get to spend so many hours buying everything you want then realizing a new update is coming out with even more expensive things! It was nice to have modded money because I could actually enjoy the game for once the struggle to get money sucked so much.
0;While initially fun and engaging for the past years its relied almost entirely on mods to keep it interesting and playable. Take 2s recent moves against the modding scene along with their statements about how some players arent spending enough on microtransactions show just how this gameis being run despite making literal billions of dollars in profit.The game is really rather dry and boring as a base game and online mode really requires you to spend more real money to even hope to compete.
0;How shameful of Take Two Interactive ( A money hungry company) to take way the modding community for GTA 5 Single player. OpenIV has been a very useful program to help us mod GTA games for 10 years. Rockstar has no play in this since they have been supporting Single Player for GTA. Blame Take Two Interactive. Good bye Modding for GTA
0;I cant not support a bunch of money s who are so against lossing a penny that they wont let you mod the single player. I hope Take Two sees these negitive comments and sees their mistake. On behalf of all the modders of single and multiplayer I hope you go bankrupt from this and you sell out to Playerunknown a true dev from the players and for the players.
0;I didn't bat an eye when they failed to deliver single player DLC.I shrugged off when they failed to ship heists with the online component.I looked away when they introduced shark cards.I can't condone Take Two's actions anymore. Let us mod our game. The game we spent money on.
0;take two just ruined gta v and lost all my interest in the game. modding kept gta fun and enjoyable but now it won't be fun to play gta because modding is illegal. I will now say goodbye to gta v until they allow mods again. Now i am going to go to another open world game to mod. Bye
0;Been a fan of GTA literally from the start have the original CD for the first one to this day.This is what happens when a company cares more about money than they do their fans.Way to take one my favourite franchises and drive it into the ground.Your game as it is online is trash modders are the only ones that made it any fun for anyone at all.
0;EDIT ILLEGAL MODDING IN SINGLE PLAYER?! WTF!What more can I say? I bought this game 3 times already. It's just that good and well worth the money. Too bad I can't get into the online multiplayer. I have great connection but the lag and input from other's are just too... buggy and wierd for me to handle.
0;Take2 took us down! Let's revert that.Huge fan of Rockstar games here I bought GTA V on PS4 for the online mode and one more time on PC for modding. I never spent one dollar in online mod but spent a lot for the modded game (without speaking about donations to modders).But now and until this bad move will still be no more Rockstar games no Red Dead Redemption 2 no GTA 6. I promise it.Just let the people be creative.
0;Take 2 interactive has decided it no longer likes needs or wants players by sending a C&amp D letter to a perfectly LEGAL mod project that can't afford to defend itself in court. Corporate bullying at its finest. If they don't want to support the players then I will no longer support them.
0;Single player is fun and has a great modding community behind it. Unfortunately the multiplayer aspect is poorly policed by an automated system so you have to avoid public lobbies or risk getting banned for existing. If you don't want to grind for hours to afford anything you have seen in videos or screenshots you better be ready to open your wallet again.
0;As a mod creator for a whole libaray of games. Take wo has just murdered this game for me. I never used mods in online play(those people suck) but if I want to bounce around town in a purple pimp suit with gold walking stick and spit flames when I fart...I bought the game...as long as my mods do not interfere with other people...STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY PURCHASES
0;All aboard the Hate train.In all seriousness though.The game is two years old yet still being sold at full price rockstar has released multiple dlc's for online while completely ignoring singleplayer they have pretty much ignored all of the issues with multiplayer and are now attacking the modding community.
0;I've loved every GTA game since its creation. I do not support the crackdown on modding and modding tools there is always gonna be bad apples on the bunch. punishing the whole community for something negative a few individuals do is not the right way of handling things. I will not buy any take two products. This whole culture of money grabbing and slap to the face is done with.
0;Take Two is run by monkeys that is the only explination for their dumb actionsThey raise the price of the game and put it on sale for its original priceThey flood the online mode with tonnes of ing microtransactions to get as much money as possibleAnd then they with the mods. off with that dude ing single player mods is the only reason to buy gta v god knows its online mode sucks massive ing dongs you Take 2 you better change your god damn stance on modding you
0;These people do not understand the absolute number of people that adored mods in this game. For me I have fond memories of playing gta 4 with carmageddon and the tsunami mod and just watching the absolute chaos while dying laughing. If they continue with this idea then they will literally kill this game in one week.
0;this game can be fun at times but take two is ing it up.https //youtu.be/0gKlBIPR_okthey banned almost all mods and are forcing players in to their microtransaction ridden hell hole witch is gta online. please do not buy this game until take two get their together because we need to send a message and stop this now before this becomes the norm.i wish i could support this game but i just cant at this moment in time
0;Do not buy this game and support Take Two's utter BS. They have made it clear that they do not care about their consumers and that if you buy their game you have zero right to change anything about it for personal singleplayer enjoyment. Not to mention how cancerous the online already is. Pay real money for everything and still have hackers kill you every time you spawn. Oh and pay $60 for that enjoyment? . Off.
0;Super grindy in free roam but the custom player races/missions are fun. The in game footage editor is very robust.Edit they recently banned modding tools even for singleplayer content. Not necessarily a reason to not buy the game but really scummy of take two to do that. Those were a huge reason to buy the game and now things like GTAV Redux and other fantastic quality singleplayer custom content can't be enjoyed. I'm changing my vote until they undo this decision.
0;Dont even bother. this game is so over run with hackers that little to nothing can be accomplished. Sorry GTA. You were once great but this is garbage. If Rockstar did anything to prevent it id say yes but hackers are so common now i cant find servers without them. No thanks bye rockstar.
0;I had so much fun in this game but combined with the recent copy paste style of new content addition and the stupid modding scandal that is happening right now I've taken a step back from the game. Great game SP and most of online wise but think carefully before supporting Take Two they literally just want to monetize your fun.
0;"""Your """"free"""" DLC mentality has been making online worse and worse since it's port but now you've gone too far. You've robbed us of our single player mods.Now you have ed up Take Two.Now ya' ed up.https //www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/06/15/grand theft auto iv mod tool openiv shut down/"""
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;Take 2 can suck it. They've ruined this. I've personally purchased the game 6 times and what theyre doing to the OpenIV team is total t. I had a hard earned 233 million in my bank account and was banned for having modded cash. Total ing t Take 2 and tar can suck it.
0;Loading simulator 5 is my favorite game to sit and wait for 3 hours to only play 1 mission. It would be a really fun game if it werent for the loading and the inability to accept random game invites from your phone. upon which fails on my 80 percent of the time..
0;TakeTwo and rockstar have decided to make the online for this game either require cheats weeks of grinding or microtransactions. Along with this they have struck down modding by taking down open IV. They simply dont care about the players they only care about money. But hey why should I expect more from these corporate s.
0;Go buy Watch Dogs 2 instead if you're looking for an open world free roaming game http //store.steampowered.com/app/447040/Watch_Dogs_2/Take Two has zero respect for their consumers.(Plus WD2 has the best Tachikoma simulator ever please Ubisoft do a Ghost in the Shell game!)
0;This game was once great But taking our mods away and forcing us to play normal online with the scum that ruin the online experience bad call. This game is nothing but a cash grab All new content is only available in the GTA online for a ridiculous amount of funds.Bought this game 4 times Xbox 360 Xbox One Playstation 4 and PC. Surely thats enough money from me
0;Take Two the parent company of Rockstar intentionally banned openIV the basic modding tool for GTA V. This means that you wasted your money if you bought GTA V on the PC just for mods. They are doing it for their own benefit and it's frankly disgraceful.
0;"""""""Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players.""""What a bold faced lie they clearly don't know anything about modding tools or care about its users. Stay away from this."""
0;These c.u.n.t.s will squeeze every penny they can from you they dissallowed mods and the online is a microtransation f.u.c.kfest. You wanna get enough money to buy ANYTHING? Good luck grind for a fu.ck.ing year doing sh.ite and repetetive missions OR PAY SIXTY F*****KING DOLLARS AND GET 3 million or somes.h.i.t. TLDR Don't buy this.
0;Would recommend but money in online is not balanced. GTA V just wants to get as much money as possible. That's why there are a lot modders because nobody feels like paying 80 euros for 8million.EDIT I got banned for no reason for ever. Customer Support doesnt exist at rockstar. No support at least not for humans.
0;The worst thing in the gaming industry is a company that cares more about the number in it's bank account than the number of satisfied customers. The gaming community is huge and if you take something incredible from that community like I don't know say OpenIV for example there will be backlash. Why anyone would be so stupid as to remove such a widely used and much loved community created feature like OpenIV baffles me. Take Two... you ed up

Filled with child ish """"Hackers"""" and Rockstar won't do about it. They haven't cared in 2 3 years so I don't think it will change.GTAO was my favourite game but... But not anymore. Filthy """"Hackers""""."""
0;Show your support for user created content mods. Take Two is taking the absoluteley wrong stance on the OpenIV issue. Rather than contacting the mod authors and trying to further restrict the ability to use the OpenIV mod in conjunction with GTA Online they autright 'ban' the mod meaning user created mods for the single player game can no longer be created.
0;Can't play game due to the continued ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT error for the past year I've had this PC(i7 GTX 1070 and 32GB of memory). And no support for anyone having this issue. And now we are not allowed to mod titles like this? Thumbs down to all parties involved in this game.
0;You removed our mods what's the point of still selling this game on steam?Imagine skyrim fallout or the arma series without mods but worse.All the prices in this game are steep. It's all a grind.You can't steal good cars in a game about stealing run by a money hungry company.If you don't connect online for a good amount of time your money suddenly vanishes.I know the lyrics to the amazing song for the loading screen... doesnt have lyrics.
0;Needs more mods. the only good thing to come from T2 is that they shut down the most infamous cheating menu. But then you wonder why did it take this long? That menu required a $260 year long subscription has this not ever bothered them before? I also agree that the DLC updates have always been overpriced. More than likely T2 forcing rockstar to nickel and dime the players.
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;Having fun with some friends in online? Maybe worth it. Trying to make ANY progress on online trying to earn money/ Forget about it. Rockstar will remove your money if you make too much in a day and leave the cheaters who spawn campfires in you alone. Don't even bother.
0;This game nowadays is just a freacking big money grab the new updates are expensives as and the number of hackers are freaking huge.Rockstar and Take Two are ruining this game by the update and now the only way to enjoy this game are trough mods made by the community.
0;Take 2 (the parent company of R*) has sent a C&amp D letter to Open IV. This is the tool which allows 80% of all mods to work in the game. It does not affect online at all. According to Take 2 it does. Open IV has now discontinued the software. KCUF YOU!!!
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. Open IV for life
0;Can no longer mod the single player game. OpenIV was a great tool that allows modding and the devs were forced to shut it down to avoid getting sued by Take2. The ironic part being that modding is the reason a majority of people bought this game in the first place.Due to their greed I will no longer buy any Take2 or Rockstar games.
0;I bought this game on PC for the modding community. Take Two took that away from us. Don't buy it for the MP either since it's basically a pay to win (Even though you pay the game 60 you still have to pay to actually have fun in the MP or grind) Bring back OpenIV
0;Rockstar Games bad job on this port... rockstar is bad in general... You bring out a game that doesnt work well.. single player is broken. payed 60 bucks for a broke item.. stop selling broken games... makes computer hardcrash. fix your standard of games or wont buy your stuff anymore.
0;so a hacker drops maybe 10k on me i try to run away after hearing all the t rockstar is doing. no luck it lands on my head. money picked up. rockstar says well hey big guy thanks for grabbin that 10k we are going to take away 20fkin million go from bein conner mcgregor to napoleon dynamite. fu rockstar you love men.
0;The game is fun until you work your butt off grinding for cash just to have it taken away because they think you cheated and won't explain why. Oh and if you should find a bug that again doesn't pay you because they think you cheated it's a huge headache to wait 3 weeks giving them every ounce of research you can do just to keep getting screwed. In my opinion rockstar games is full of crooks.
0;Good game. singleplayer is one of the most amazing games ive ever experienced. dont play online. it is riddled with hackers and wronful bans. you can basically do nothing without buying shark cards. if you are playing singleplayer buy this game. if your looking for a good online game look somewhere else.
0;The singleplayer game is great on its own. The multiplayer is mediocre to terrible on its own. The multiplayer is basically a grindfest in order to have anything cool. The singleplayer mod situation is bad. Take2 is now threatening mod developers who develop singleplayer mods over concerns for the multiplayer experience.
0;With the multiple attacks on the modding community from the parent company Take Two Interactive I can't support this game. Recent attacks of Open IV it's really a lot of people off and it's simply uncalled for.Don't support these attacks on the community DO NOT BUY!EDIT Open IV is back but only because of the overwhelming pushback my review remains the same..
0;MY LITTLE GOLDEN MONKEY BOY!! MY TWO TON BARREL OF FUN!! OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH OOHEdit I am changing my review to negative due to the disgusting actions Rockstar has done.My best friend might not be my best friend right now if I hadn't spent almost 200 hours playing with him and mods in GTA IV...This is a revolting choice for money rather than fans. I begrudgingly accepted when it was just none in multiplayer but this is . offfffff
0;As much as it hurts me to give this game a negative review especially having put almost 400 hours into it it deserves it for how money hungry Rockstar has become the online being a continuous grind for money and most importantly the recent situation regarding OpenIV is just really really sad. Instead of getting rid of online modding they removed singleplayer modding making it illegal. I hope Take Two and Rockstar realise what they have done and undo this.
0;DO NOT buy this game. If Take Two is going to go out of their way to prevent mods being made/available then you as a consumer should go out of your way to not buy this game. Let them know that doing this was the wrong move. Do not reward this type of behavior.
0;I have had this game since it came out. PS3 4 and PC versions. Was great now trash.Unfortunately take two and rockstar has gone too far. To send a cease and desist order for a program that is used for 99% of single player mods and disables online play use with mods? Really? It stops the massive flow of creative content and forces CC's to stop being creative and putting their time in to this game. Without OpenIV watch the player base drop. RIPepperoni you piece of s**t CEO of Take Two.
0;Be aware Every update the system requirements go up by 1 generation.Update Changed to Not Recommended. Not only because of the scuffle with the modding community but now their DRM insists I don't own a copy of the game when (surprise surprise) I do. Now I have to contact their support get through at least 3 layers of cookie cutter answers by uninterested service reps and get my copy of the game that I purchased back.Thanks for the extra DRM tar.
0;I played this game alot on 360 before buying on PC for modding purposes. Never bothered to leave a review until this fiasco T2 is pulling with OpenIV essentially barring modding for no reason. If youre just a passer by reading this review wondering if you should buy the game don't. Dont support this very greedy and malicious company. Don't give them your money don't give them your time and most importantly don't give them the opportunity to make gaming a worse place.
0;ERR_GEN_ZLIB_2Failed zlib call please reboot or reinstall gameFix it fast! I can't play online whenever i start first race this error appears and it as well crashes like this in single player fix ASAP!Now i cant even start game it stucks at loading screen.
0;The fact that modding has been banned from single player is something that should be illegal they arent letting people do what they want with their own property. I also got banned from Online mode for no reason PERMANENTELY. YOU ROCKSTAR AND YOU TAKE TWO.
0;Very disappointed in Take Two's decision to randomly go after the modding community and Rockstar's half hearted paragraph of a defense.Also why the to I need to spend like $60 or grind for months to purchase a flying bike for use in GTA Online?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
0;The game is fun but there is no way I will support a company (Take Two not Rockstar) that actively destroys the modding community of their games.There is so much creativity that mod developers have to offer but all Take Two cares about is microtransactions. Laughing all the way to the bank.
0;Fun game ruined by loading times and lack of support for private servers.The single player is probably fun.Multiplayer is designed in a way that it tries to get you to buy their shark cards (in game money) and the loading times / connection times are horrible. Often you'll also get disconnected from lobbies.Multiplayer is probably best played by just doing the heists once with a group of friends and forgetting the game after.
0;no open IV as its single player mods somehow effected multiplayer. i guess they really dont like the single player aspect of the game.ive actually seen MORE hackers in online since the removal of openIV.oh and its still hurrendous to earn money. they just really want to sell off their loansharkcards.
0;Absolute and utter boring garbage.Got banned because hackers dropped money on me without my permission Rock Star does not care game is actually extremely boring there is nothing to do heists are fun but not enough of them and doing same thing over and over again is very tidious and gets boring.Alternative Multiplayer which would resurrect this game was shut down forever.
0;I never modded this game. However mods give people the ability to make games more creative fun and help to improve games that devs have long since abandoned. you Take Two. Hope you're ing happy for killing one of the biggest reasons you jack offs got sales on PC.
0;Take Two has really screwed the pooch here with the whole Open IV situation. This is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;The Game is good best GTA game so far overall.. with one exception..FIX THE DAMN ING MULTIPLAYER IT'S FULL OF CHEATERS MODDERS SCRIPT KIDDIES AND ALL SORTS OF GRIEFERS. IMPLEMENT A MAJOR ANTI CHEAT AND I N G BAN ALL CHEATERS2.75 k / d ratio FAIR online playerConsidering that this game has no working anti cheat it's not worth buying
0;This game used to be awesome but now it's just a shameless cashgrab full of grinding to get even basic stuff. I tried to make enough money to get cool stuff to play with but it just felt like work. It's not fun anymore. I hope someday R* will make amends for what they did to what could have been a great game.
0;This is the official resource to Rockstar Games. If you want to close Open IV then find a suitable replacement. Official GTA V mod manager would be fine. You can also made a normal zombie mod for GTA V singleplayer that would be also fine. But at this moment you are indifferent about singleplayer and focused on online but inline missions are not very interesting either.
0;Milking money from consumers by releasing the game 3 times at full price no single player dlc microtransactions the only plausible way to get the cool stuff online and now modding has essentially been made illegal. Enough is enough. Do not give them your money all they do is push you for GTAO for more money we're sorry that 60 quid isn't enough considering GTAV is in the top 5 for highest grossing games of all time. this that and you Take Two
0;Take Two is screwing over the modding scene by blocking OpenIV just because they want to suck even more money out of players and push them into the garbage gta online environment. At this point gta 5 is not a game anymore it is a milking machine for take two in which they try to get as much money as possible before they destroy the whole gaming environment. They will probably do it with other games as well soon enough.
0;I bought this game for the singleplayer mods now im not allowed to play those singleplayer mods and now they want us to go online to a place i wouldnt consider a fun time with all the hackers and trollsAnd i see now the shark cash cards are on the steam page them selfs? I guess they were too hidden and so they just need to put them anywhere and everywhere to get people to try and buy them
0;"""Gta V was simple when you could play single player with any mods you can choose but this is no longer simple option. Mods for Gta V is now """"Illegal"""" sadly I wish for them to learn they're mistakes and allow people to mod single player games again."""
0;Take Two Interactive and everything they stand for. I loved modding single player games and Take Two has just taken a giant on the modding community. This was in my opinion the single worst mistake a game maker could make. Take Two is going to loose a lot of money because of this and that makes me very happy.Rest In Peace OpenIV
0;This is a fantastic game and one of my favorites in the past few years. However with their recent acctions against modding even modding the single player by sending a cease and desist to OpenIV means I will no longer be supporting Take Two or Rockstar from this point forward unless they issue a formal appology and officially retract this action.
0;This is was a good game. It had a good story and the modding WAS great. But now I can't recommend it anymore. Take Two Interactive have screwed it all up destroying the majority of the mods. If they ever undo this I'll change this review. But for now it isn't worth it.
0;Take2 is forcing people to go into their money machine (aka GTA Online) see things they want to have and then go have them buy shark cards with real money to pad their pockets.Singleplayer mods were not stealing business from them and addressed a major critique of the game they abandoned singleplayer. All the new content is multiplayer only and extremely overpriced. Even ammo can bankrupt people in the online.This game is nothing but a cash grab now.
0;"""Thank you Rockstar for making this ing game unplayable.Every session is """"hosted"""" by modders and cheaters putting you in a cage or spawn u in the ocean. ing 60 for t. You don't care about banning them to hell instead you are advertising your ridicioulous shark cards. You!"""
0;The worst gaming community in the entire world. Take Two are money grabbing asseholes. GTA offline modding was my passion and my love the whole reason I had the game the fact that you declare this 'illegal' is utterly ridiculous and takes away any sense of community or creatvitity from the games OPENIV allowed people to mod.
0;GTA Online is a hot mess. Countless dlc's with content that can only reasonably be experienced by being honestly foolish with your credit card. Nevermind the innumerable quality of life problems that have never been addressed. The loading screens alone will make you regret launching this game.It really isn't worth playing.
0;Everything Is Good( EVERYTHING GONE TO S H I T )Good Game Good Graphics Good Story Good Choices Good Gameplay. The story left me thinking and smiling this game brought me enjoyment that I haven't felt in a long time. If you're thinking of buying this game then buy it it's worth it.EDIT NEGATIVE REVIEW. F � C K TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE. I'M S.O P I S S E D OFF THEY REMOVE MODDING. NOT SUPPORTING THIS MOVE. HOPE THE PLAYER COUNT GOES DOWN.
0;Not supporting mods I understaand. There are plenty of games that do not have developer driven modding communities. Actively trying to shut it down on the otherhand that is unforgivable. This move is about as anti consumer as they come. Will not be purchasing another product that involves Take Two or Rockstar.
0;Great single player fantastic open world as per usual of rockstar. Online is a how basically everything there is completely out of touch with reality in regards to pricing. Rockstar parent company take2 recently banned an essential mod tool for reasons?
0;GTA V the game to end all games the only game you could buy three times and not regret on the xbox 360 for the first experience pn the ps4 for that revitalised experience and on pc for mods. To bad they ed that up good game but dont buy on pc not worth it anymore
0;used to love this game me and the guys would play inline and have a fantasitic time. but now after wave after wave of unjustified perma bans constant shady bussnisse practices and the recent anti moding thing implimented by take2 i regeret ever giving these people a single cent. these guys for ruining a great game would refund if i could.
0;This games was good now it's just pure bad. You take away the modding in single player is why this game was popular. The online community is just terrible. Now this game is the only game I have in my steam library that stutters so hard now. Random frame drops in open areas where I should be getting 60+fps. This game is just bad around. Sorry Rockstar but I don't recommend this game to anyone now.
0;Do not buy GTA IV. I have been a owner of all GTA series from the humble beginnings and now they are going in the wrong dirrection buy banning mods. GTA online sucks So we make it our way. Uninstalled And will NEVER buy a nother product again untill you pull your heads out of your butts. Gambino (Pis sed off customer)Screw Take2
0;Pretty much anyone in Online behaves like he just turned 14 and Rockstar forces you to play on public lobbies instead of closed ones with friends only. Online turned into a hell of a grind and now Take Two takes a huge dump at costs of modders who didn't even touch Online.I played this game for hundreds of hours and during this process I got more and more disappointed in decisions made by R*.So yeah I feel like following the trend and give a negative review.
0;"""SO they now have removed modding and made it """"illegal"""" id say we gamers rise u� and all send a angry not to rockstar that theyshove a stick up where the sun dont shine and give us a atleast half refund of all money spent on their """"moddable"""" games"""
0;Take 2 and Rockstar have been cracking down on the single player mod community to try and drive people to play online where they want you to buy in game currency with real money. This decision to go after modders to try drive shark card sales is abhorrent I am now adding take 2 and rockstar to my boycott list right alongside ubisoft and ea. Well some boys you've made sure you won't get a single penny more from me because of your petty/greedy behaviour.
0;Despite the little to no retaliation against players abusing third party cheats and hacks in the online portion of the game TakeTwo has decided to do something now. What did they do?Essentially ban single player modifications modifications that have no interaction with the multiplayer scene.T2 and RStar have earned themselves this outrage over a foolish decision and it would be wise to not trust them in the future with your time or your money.
0;Well as most of these review shows Take Two has done screwed up by discontinuing OpemIV. I have been playing GtaV for a bit with most hours logged in lcpdfr. Now I have lost all faith not only in the game but company as well. Sad to see the company pick profits over player.
0;Take 2 doesn't understand the community it's making stuff for. Also online might as well be pay to play since you'll never make enough money in the game to buy all the cool cars or bikes so you'll have to buy the shark cards. So like $50 for a bike. Um no thanks.
0;UPDATE I used to love this game but now the only way to get money is by grinding or buying shark cards. I hate this because GTA 5 online is now full of hackers and gets boring real quick with very little ways of getting money. For now I will finish singleplayer mode and see what happens... For now I don't recommend getting this until it gets at a very low price.
0;GTA online is a mico transaction filled hell hole of hackes and pay win win players. You can't go anywhere without someone rolling down the road i ntheir indistructable car chucking bombs at you. The last bastion of fun this game had was single player modding. Now that they have taken that away there is no reason to get this game.
0;You should know by now that you do not ban the community from providing content this late in the game without getting for it. You're going to reverse this decision we know it but you better damn well make sure you send out a real apology or it's going to hurt you an awful lot.
0;Pros Story mode is good Wide range of vehicles to choose from Cons Multiplayer is awful and full of cheaters Microtransactions You earn alot less money in multiplayer than in story modeUpdate Take 2 just shutdown the main program for sp modding. Thumbs down for that. Edit they may have revoked what they have just done but thanks to rockstars new modding policy a highly anticipated mod will not be released and for that im not gonna change my view.
0;Never supporting greedy money grubbing antics.Banning Mods for this game is the last straw for me and these game companies thinking they can squeez us of our hard earned money!.. We all need to make our voices heard by doing things like this and not giving them any more money to take from us!.. I for one am for paying for the hard work of the devs but not the greedy money hungry PR's and other corporate b***ards.
0;One of the potentially best games ever made (Even after abandoning the original course of the game being 100% single player world) All my hours played are Modded SP playtime. GTA Online is complete 12 year old trash(IMO). Wont ever support another game from these people. Banning SP modding. Just wow worst move ever made.
0;Rockstar and Take 2s view on the playerbase Oh I see you are having fun in the multiplayer here have some insane grindwalls so you don't have too fun.Oh you are having fun modding in the singelplayer sorry but fun is not what are game is about we will shut down the modding tools so you can enjoy the game as we intended it
0;Randomly clicked on this game saw negative reviews don't know why but i want to rate this game negative too. YOU ROCKSTAR FOR SOMETHING.Randomly clicked on this game saw negative reviews don't know why but i want to rate this game negative too. YOU ROCKSTAR FOR SOMETHING.
0;DONT BUY THIS!!! F***** YOU ROCKSTAR!!!!I AM A PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE PLAYER AND SPENT DOZENS OF HOURS GRIDING COLLECTING MONEY TO BE ABLE TO BUY YOUR SUPER EXPENSIVE DLC ITEMS ONLY TO LOGIN AFTER THE SMUGGLERS RUN UPDATE WITH 75% OF ALL MY MONEY GONE!!!THEY CANT TELL WHO IS A HACKER OR LEGITIMATE PLAYER SO THEY DECIDED TO TAKE EVERYONES MONEY AWAY!! THEY ARE FORCING YOU TO BUY THEIR SHARKCARDS!!!!I WONT EVER BUY ONE OF THEIR GAMES AGAIN!!
0;Rockstar doesn't care about its players. They only want you to buy their game and spend hundreds of dollars on Shark Cards. Scummy and corrupt devs. Really wish Rockstar would start giving a crap but the billions of dollars they've made has changed them.
0;This is a fantastic game but take 2 have ruined it and its fanbase of modders go to change.org and sign the peititon to help bring back modding.EDIT they took away the cease and desist (i know i wrote that wrong) but still the fact remains that they wanted to shut down what has given many people joy is an insult. i love this game but my dislike will still linger on.Meepsweep
0;Dont bother getting the game becuase you will get ban for no reasion other then playing. I played for a bit got off and cleaned the floors got back on to play and i was ban. Thats all there was to it. rockstar and everything they make for me from now on.
0;I used to like this game but up until recently it slowed down and lost frames to the point that I cannot play it. I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this problem but as I have searched there is no easy fix that I have tried over countless tries. 0/10 bad game not recommended.
0;few months ago i rate this game is recommended and now is negative why? Cause the game have been ruined bay mod hack. Yes MOD HACK everywhere but R* never have any action to get those thing under control and its get me and all of my fr abadon the game for too long dont buy the game yet until all those thing is over ._.
0;"""This game use to be amazing. Rockstar use to listen to their fans. I was of the many that had money dumped on them. I log in after they """"fixed"""" it and reduced all assets to 250k. Nothing in this game is cheap and spending hundreds of hours does not net the trouble of what you want. 100$ for in game money that may only get your a few things is just insane. New content is just adding insanity to the mix."""
0;really tiring for LOADING !!!!!! mision loadinggg cancel misioon loading leaver loading.... searching for money like an idiot prepare for heist is helll nooo 1 hour waiting players to willing set up heist still yet one leave party over WASTING TIME ING IDIOTTT
0;I come from work far away to play game and what I get unaccepteble I open game and no work why no work? i ask you rockstar unaccepltable i dont agree to this i go to launcher put my detailes in the box and it no work why no work? I ask you rockstari have 3 children hungry at home and no gta to comfot them i give you 1 finger and you take my hand i dont understand rockstar i loved you rockstar we were like trump and kim jong un.unacceptableshame on you
0;I spawned in the game and was immediately robbed of all the money I made so far. I chased the guy and eventually came in the middle of nowhere and then He trew me onto a plane and flew away. until I died.10/10 Would fly againNEVERMIND forget that Take Two is utter I kept playing this games shallow story mode because of the mods and then they basically made the main tool for installing mods illigal.
0;lol i regret playing online. it was not fun at all. with the recent updates its worse everything is overpriced the community in general is pretty bad. Wish they had more options in single player like riot mode or fun cheats like the previous titiles. but im pretty sure rockstar will never think about that since they are only focusing online.
0;The single player game was great especially with mods the online was cancer because of insane amounts of micro transactions. The recent action of take two to remove openIV making modding next to impossible to make people that want certain ALREADY IN THE DAMN GAME cars have to go to online there for give them more money than they are already making have being one of the most highly sold games.
0;Bring back mods. Seriously wtf Take Two. How on Earth could modding the singleplayer possibly affect your revenue??? GTA V is literally the second best selling game on the planet with each copy costing 40+. So you're saying that's not enough money and you want to punish your players for not buying enough of your overpriced microtransactions ( 60 gets you just enough in game money to buy a yacht. That's it. A virtual yacht for 60!) by taking away mods? Disgusting.
0;Forget about buying this game. Online is and single player is boring after you beat it. The only reason why i would have recomended this game back then was for the single player mods but now single player mods are illegal apparently.SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE! DON'T EVEN BUY IT ON SALE!
0;It angers me that Take Two shut down the modding in singelplayer and I didn't even mod the game. What's anger me more is that Rockstart did nothing when this happened they don't want to support modding anymore just because they want to earn a little bit more money out of multiplayer.
0;Used to be fun now just full of overpriced junk and people abusing the system.Now they ban modding? The sole thing that keeps games alive after completion and adds a variety of new experiences?Not a good move but will they care? No.The worst connection issues ever. Barely get on let alone play a Random Job or heck play alongside some friends.
0;"""PIRATE THIS GAME BUY IT FOR CHEAPER OFF A SITE THAT DOESN'T FUND TAKE2go fOOOOOOOOk yourself take2 and rs this game had so much potential but you decided to your customers with pay to win tactics to it all up by making all of the stuff you could buy """"for free"""" in the updates.after 700+ of playing this i reccomend downloading fivem and not waiting 10 minutes for your game to load and immediately get killed by people."""
0;Everyone is leaving negative reviews for a good reason here. Taketwo and Rockstar went full money grab mode and took a massive dump on the modding community which in my honest opinion made Grand Theft Auto a helluva more popular game in the whole gaming community due to modders marketing this game with their videos (Machinimas etc).
0;Okay I understand cheats and hacks on multiplayer being banned but the banning of singleplayer mods is absolutely unjust. Nothing is being sold (at least I haven't purchased any of my mods) and I believe that after the purchase of a game the user should do with their game as they please so long as it isn't illegal. Mods have been used in several several games even on this very medium singleplayer and multiplayer alike so R* why do you think you should be so different?
0;I used to be a loyal fan of all things Rockstar. I bought this game three times at full retail price (PS3 PS4 PC). Your parent company's decision to send OpenIV a cease and desist is not only anti consumer but also goes against this series history of supporting mods.
0;Game started out great with a lot of promise. But cashgrabs and stuff has caused the game to be garbage. Only focus is on the online section which is buggy and imbalanced to a major fault which essentially means there will never be any single player DLC and none has ever been released. They banned the use of mods even for single player which is just insane.
0;Singleplayer? Hell yeah it's great fun.Multiplayer however is a playground for the rich rule breakers. Of course I'm still going to play it. I have a few friends who I can work with but nobody wants to be in a lobby where someone blows up all your stuff for a measly $2k.It's a playground for the rich because literally ALL OF the new content costs more than $1 million. It's impossible to afford if you're someone like me who doesn't kill randomly and blow up your CEO stuff for a measly $2k.
0;It used to be fun playing online but the prices kept growing and dlc's were comming. Many great games died because of greed. If it wasn't bad enough now we can not mod singleplayer mode. A year ago I would have given 10+ but now I'm not even sure if I would buy it.
0;Take Two decided to cease and desist the OpenIV team essentially killing mods for single player for no good reason. This is something we should and will not stand for. If the single player is going to be left to die with no DLC while the Online continues to be filled with hackers and then you decide to kill the one thing making the single player more fun I see no reason why I should play your game anymore.
0;This game has gone from garbage during it's release to alright after a few dlcs but now it's been tainted by anti modding t. Most people don't know how to create scripts to run our mods so we download them but now rockstar has sued the openIV team which doesn't seem to be coming out with any updates any time soon. Haven't heard anything about scripthook V lately regarding whether or not it has been shutdown as well but it's been a few days and nothing yet has been released.
0;"""After over 100 hours of gameplay I was watched a """"best of GTA V mods video"""" and finally decided I gotta try these things. Why had I waited so long to begin with? I went to download OpenIV only to learn that the embargo was enacted 5 hours before I had finally made the decision to unlock the games full entertainment potential. Go suck a grundle Take Two."""
0;I've been playing this game since it came out and I can confirm the game is not what it used to be. All balance in online is gone and R*'s Shark Card system is the epitome of a microtransaction pay to win scheme. This game is no longer worth purchasing.
0;Loaded with Cheaters and Modders and Social Club doesn't seem to be doing anything about it. Save your money. No sense in paying when others cheat and Social Club does nothing about it. I'm done buying Shark Cards it's pointless when so many others don't and get away with it.
0;T2 did us dirty with taking down OpenIV.. It is not even fair Rockstar has been my favourite and grand theft auto series but now why do we have to support someone who does us like this? T2 willingness to make more money no matter what ultimately back stabbed them.
0;SIngleplayer is great but not too much to do after you beat the game.Multiplayer is garbage. Laggy and no dedicated servers in 2016 for such a big budget game.Oh and don't even bother with online because 95% of lobbies have hackers.Take2 can suk my dree.UPDATES 2017Dont buy this or any of their future games.They have basically shut down mods. em
0;This game was quite fun and definitely one of the best of its time BUT I cannot recommend this game in its current state as T2 really screwed up by sending a C&amp D to OpenIV and I do not recommend buying anymore Rockstar games until the situation is resolved. (May edit when fixed)
0;So take2 you've manage to off your ENTIRE gta playerbase based on the assumption that all modding tools enable hackers......Bravo This kids is how you sink a company t2 need to step down and let someone who really knows wtf they are doing instead of a buncha old geezers making base assumptions.
0;The issue with this game is the massive amount of pay to win to get new content. everything is there to push the next shark card buy. That plus ruining the single player modding company is a big fail on your part. Whens the last time they added anything for single player.
0;WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWTriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard TriHard
0;The games complete garbage now the online is a grindfest and the singleplayer lost one of the most important modding tools of its time not too mention that rockstar refuses to update singleplayer so if you thought wanted some cool vehicles in singleplayer you can't not even modding them in is easy R* tried to stop people modding Online vehicles into singleplayer just so that people would go online and buy more shark cards if think that tells you all you need to know about rockstar as a company
0;By far the best $60 you'll spend for quite some time. Once you start playing you won't be able to stop. The multiplayer is terrific and the singlepalyer is both fun and hilarious.10/10 Would buy again !Update After this recent move to attempt to shutdown all modding support I am officially changing my review of GTA V. I don't think I have the words to describe how disappointed about the course of action that Take Two has taken.
0;Highly unrecommend the game for new players1. Players likes to spoil your supply runs2. Takes a hell lot of time to earn back what you invested into the businesses3. DLC proved too expensive and not necessary 4. Content is repetitiveThis is highly based on personal opinion so if you dont agree its your problem P
0;Dissapointing. I don't care for GTA 5 online but love the fact I can extend the life of the single player game with the addition of mods. Well Take Two and Rockstar obiously don't like that and feel the need to push me towards their online game by taking down OpenIV thus ending the cycle of modding. All that achieves is we are now all losers. Very sad days ahead for theses two companies. Thanks ruining my fun!
0;Modding is the only thing that keeps this game alive. Even rockstar showcases pictures and videos that were made by mods. I get trying to eliminate hackers but people can and still will be hacking more than ever. If your that scared of people hacking in online that means your anti cheat is shiot. Bring OPENIV back or i will never purchase another one of your games.
0;full of moddersand instead of banning the moddersthey ban the innocentsi was just doing some fun mission with my friend and got randomly bannedand now they removed openiv i cant do anything with their sh*t gameif you want it get it on a console and im never buying any rockstar games production again
0;Take Two are a bunch of money hungry dirtbags. They took down modding in single player for a problem that exists in multiplayer how the hell does that even make any sense? Moral of the story is they will do anything to squeeze an extra $59.99 shark card out of anyone even if it means destroying the single player experience so you will buy dumb things on GTA Online.
0;If you enjoy playing with hackers and modders who totally ruin the online experience then buy this game. They are in every single server ever like literally every one. Rockstar won't do anything and the problem is out of control. DO NOT buy this game unless you go single player only.
0;Outstanding singleplayer trash multiplayer.GTA Online has gotten grindier than even Free to Play games in their attempts to psychologically manipulate you into buying microtransactions.This game is full of hackers but in the past patches the number of hackers have not seemingly decreased at all. The only thing that's stopped is hackers giving people free money. All this seems to show is that Take Two doesn't seem to mind having hackers in their lobbies as long as no one gets free money.
0;The story mode is pretty good.The online however is pretty bad for starters if you have no friends to play with.8/10Edit Rockstar has started banning alot of people for no reasons and it seems like they are cashing out of the game.The community is now full of griefers and such and heists are almost impossible to complete even with a friend.I've also started getting alot of crashes since the latest update (cunning stunts).Would not recommend for online play but single maybe
0;I played ps3 first game got boring pretty fast. There is one thing you need alot of friends for online get cool mods for singleplayer and be creative. Or else this game sucks. But the graphics are awesome. I still love this. Waiting for GTA 6 rockstar!Well theyre against it now sooo dont get it!
0;GTA San Andreas made me love the PC platform as it introduced me to the world of game modding. The recent removal of modding tools for GTA V's single player game mode is not only moronic but absolutely useless I'm combating online hacking. This is just another attempt by a game dev at trying to control their products post purchase. You don't see Ford putting locks on the hood of customers cars 4 years after they sold them. Why the is this OK in the game industry?
0;you Rockstar and Take Two. Take Two may make the big business decisions but I haven't heard anything from the Houser bros about this. They're just as corporate now and raking in millions from Shark Cards. GTA has been cheapened in so many ways and this is just the final nail in the coffin. Don't buy.
0;I'm here to vote purely based on their decision to cease and desist one of the critical mods for this game. I think OpenIV is an amazing platform that has if anything helped create more joyful experiences the the original game ever could. Shutting it down is just bad on every bloody end. GTAV is a cool game but their decision making is just awful.
0;The game itself is alright. But Take 2 Interactive made the choice to completely kill any value there was to this game. One of the primary reasons this game is still sellable at 59.99 is because of the modding community. They killed a primary tool in modding the game and really for no good reason at all. Money hungry and they don't care about their fans.Won't be purchasing another T2 game more than likely..
0;Since the Drop Zone DLC ( 2016?) all prices (Vehicles Weapons Gear etc.) went over the mountains (A flying Bike for 2.6m$?) plus modding in Single player is nowhere near as much fun as in the earlier GTAs (IV San Andreas etc.)Would I recommend it in 2016? Yes definetly.Would I recommend it now? No.Why? Prices.You can't even sell properties MC CEO or Pegasus vehicles..
0;Take Two have just proven that they only want money out of their game despite the high number of sales from shark cards. Piracy my this game was great for modding graphically and physics wise as well. That's why I bought the PC version. Unless this crap goes away I'm never buying from them again.
0;Don't buy this. Rockstar and Take Two destroyed a flourishing community of modding and robbed everyone who worked on the mods for months of their work. Seriously not acceptable.Sign this petition to save mods https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;hacking simulator 2015It feels like every 2nd player in multiplayer is using third party software to mess up the gameRandom players popping up in vehicles aimbotting stripping weapons completely from players passive mode abusinginsta blowing every player vehicle on the map spawning obstacles in your face (even large buildings).do not buy this game for now it is unplayable like this.
0;Worked really hard to make money in this game got 1mill saved up from hiests and stuff and was excited to keep saving and working my way to buying cool stuff then I logged in one day and I had $0 lmao they took away my money from some reason so i uninstalled this game is trash unless you wanna drop thousands of real life dollars on it.
0;I enjoy this game.Controls though leave a lot to be desired though. Even the car controls are bad unless you have a controller. If you have a controller get this game. Characters in the main story are fun and interesting but the controls are a major pain and turnoff for keyboard and mouse users.
0;Bought GTA 5 only to play LSPDFR Mod as i played alot of similar mods on GTA 4.In the past Rockstar openly supported moding gta but suddenly have now banned open iV and modding. In what can only be seen as a tactic to try and increase sales of (pay2win) shark cards in multiplayer. Total sell outs from a company that sold alot of copies off the back of modders.Wont be recommending or buying anymore games from rockstar.
0;After hearing about the ban on modding. I was very disappointed. I had this game for the ps4 before I bought the the pc version because I heard that you could do more things with the game and expanded the way you play the game your way. After playing online and grinding for all the money it just got boring but modding really kept the game alive for me. But now they are taking that away. I might as well invest my money some where else.
0;Gta 5 used to be fun usually because of the updates and the fun of playing with other players. Gta 5 story mode is great but online is crap I got banned twice for hacking despite the fact that i wasn't hacking other fellow hackers in the game have the power to crash your game and ban you its ridiculous gta security is crap.
0;"""I've always loved gta for feature of modding adapting it for myself. That's why I bought it and all versions before. Freedom of choice a lot of fun and memories. Thanks to mods. And now they make the main thing that keeps the game alive """"ilegal"""". Thank you very much ing money hungry developers. Thanks for ruining a great game.I'm not going to buy the next one. That's for sure.On behalf of the OpenIV team you."""
0;this game used to be good but now its all about micro transactions. its a capitalist hell pit. not fun unless you pour countless dollars into this washed out mess of a game. they only want to milk peoples money and monetize the crap out of this. no creative freedom no fun.
0;They totally ruined the modding community which was one of the only reasons I played the game. It is an awesome game and I really enjoyed it but cutting off the modding community and its history wit hthe GTA series is just disrespectful. Would have rated up but they just dont deserve it there has to be another way of stopping hackers than demolishing the modding community.
0;TakeTwo banned modding in first player for selfish means. I was going to reinstall this game to play with some mods/play online but the day before I saw that modding was banned. I will not be reinstalling this game nor purchase future Rockstar games until modding is allowed again. I have means to play their future games ).
0;Phew what can I say. I put a lot of time into this game but the multiplayer aspect is a huge money drain. Everything is overpriced nothing pays they want you to buy shark cards to buy more useless things. I'm done with this game. Now they want to stop modding the only thing that is keeping this game alive?! Horrible way to treat your user base...
0;Another legend about to become out of touch with the fans disregarding the right thing to do. I've had hours upon hours upon hours of fun with each installment of GTA over the years but the future is less than promising. Luckily I was already mad at them for making RDR2 console exclusive.I will admit though shooting themselves in the leg is a pretty Rockstar thing to do.
0;Due to Rockstars resent changes I have been forced to uninstall GTA V and I will not be returning. If Rockstar would embrace the modding community and make game modes like LSPDFR into the game as a update the game would be more enjoyable and lower the cost of weapons vehicles property and raised the payout for heists people wouldn't be forced to use money mods.
0;On behalf of the OpenIV team you. You are seriously going to ban all mods? That is hilarious that you will not allow the community to play what they want to play. Good job Rock* you have successfully brought your own game to its knees.EDIT Sign this petition please https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv &lt 3
0;Product received for free. Its a very fun game that I enjoy playing and have played for hundreds of hours but the hackers online have completely ruined the entire expirience and you can't get a single populated freeplay lobby without someone taking away you're weapons or just doing something horrible to grief and troll. So if you are going to buy you better not be relying on the online expirience thats for sure.
0;The single player game is great but the GTA Online portion sucks. its riddled with hackers and cheaters and rockstar will just blanket ban people. Theyve done an excellent job of making GTA Online unplayable for fair players. I would not recommend this game. spend 60 bucks on something that works.
0;No more mods.... The thing that made the PC version excel. BUT NOPE! get shutdown OpenIV because we couldn't find any other possible way to beat hackers. No more LSPDFR no more flying mods no character mods etc.... If you want to buy this because of modding don't because it doesn't exist any more. Sad day
0;It is a terrible joice from Take Two and Rockstar to wage war on mods and modders modding enhanes the over all experience and without these mods or support for said mods you come to see how bad these companies mannage their game. Summary Go Mods Take Two and Rockstar
0;I stand with the modding community and open IV ..The game is great single player but online it is the wild west rockstar have no control....This move to ban modding is the equivilent of using a nuke to kill an ant.. Totaly stupid and not the way to fix the online exploitsAs much as ive enjoyed this game i now can no longer say its worth the buy.Fix your and stop punnishing those who gave your game extended shelf life.....
0;i had all my in game money taken because of the new anti modding. I dont mod and i never asked a modder to give me money. that said. its not like i didnt enjoy it. i had 340 00 and they took all but 19 000. how petty. i earned that 340 000 by selling cars ingame. maybe if they didnt place new items in the game at such a stupidy high ammount. i wouldnt be so upset. so if you play the game watchout. rockstar has turned into big brother is is punishing everyone. modder or not.
0;If you're thinking of buying this game on PC for mods forget about it. Take Two hates you they hate modders and they will actively threaten single player modders with legal action to push their greedy micro transaction scheme. My advice to you If you love mods in any game on any platform vote with your wallet. Don't buy this game and show them that this won't stand.
0;Rockstar will certainly not be grabbing my money in future games GTA V mostly talking about online practically forces you to use microtransactions to proceed through the game. New update with all kinds of cool stuff? Either spend 50 hours grinding to get it or just pay $20.00 to have it sooner. Get out of my face with that crap no thanks.
0;BIG NEWS They've sent a cease and desist to one of the largest modding sources for all of GTA. I'm not one for modding but I know it is one of the biggest things for lotsa people. Disgusting don't support this game or company plzlook at all the other negative reviews there is something to these claims fellas I recommend heeding the warning.
0;I bought this game for its modding potential in singleplayer. Now that take 2 is trying to force those modder that played in single with online vehicles by removing that mod the game just hasent been worth playing. I'm not about to spend my summer grinding in online or spend thousands/ hundreds of dollars in online either.
0;This game has so many flaws but the insane ammount of benefits outweighs them. Yes modding SP can be a pain and there's no SP DLC but the entire SP of the game is ABSOLUTELY amazing. Online has bad servers and there's occasionally hackers but if you play invite only with friends it's some of fun. Edit Take Two probably refunding since I can't mod.
0;Rockstar likes random banning. Its like they play spin the bottle once an hour in every server. And poof your banned! For no reason. No mods. Nobody giving money. No Exploits. I sold an expensive car to buy a new one finially upgraded it drove it for a few minutes and then BOOM $60 / 450+ hours down. the. drain. Support is just an automated message. F U Rockstar. F. U.
0;If you haven't bought this game yet(even though you probably have at least 2 copies already) please consider otherwise. R* have always made great games but their owners think that $60 is not enough money for this game. Now they have decided to kill something that has built a legacy in this immense emersive playground. If you value your money don't give it to Take Two it will never be enough for them.R.I.P OpenIV and Gta Modding
0;Hate to put a negative review but...Great game lots of fun to be had in the singleplayer and multiplayer however TakeTwo has discarded singleplayer DLC and recently put out a cease and desist on the major mod for GTA VI and V replacing it with a microtransaction hellscape in Online. Other than that the game is amazing as you can see by my hour count I just *highly* recommend not paying for the microtransaction t.
0;First off you COMPLEATLY ignored Single player For 3 years No DLC for it no nothing and now your taking away modding the only reason to play single player is the mods you Morons!!! And if this is some attempt to get us to pay for mods you should have a talk with the guys at Steam and ask them how well that worked out for them when they tried it for Skyrim. So Rockstar and Take Two in the Entertainment please be so kind and to go yourselves .
0;Great singleplayer/ Online is microtransaction garbage/ mods were great but now are being attacked by the publisher/devs/I can not give this game a positive score when the things that are wrong with it are caused by greed from publisher/devs/Ive bought this game 4 times twice on 360 once for xbox one once on pc I bought this version for mods without them I wasted my money.
0;Get your act together already and fix this game. Its bee out for almost 3 years and stil having issues with latency getitng stuck in loading screens not having HUD while in game friends just not gettig invites to missions and so many more issues I've encounted this last 4 days after having quit the game for 2 years.
0;Ah the grand GTA V. Once a fun game full of modding potential now reduced to what it really was all along a money printer for Rockstar. Sorry that we don't like your crappy online mode where you either grind or fork over more money than you spent on the original game. I guess we'll all just go play something else.Rest in peace GTA V.Rest in peace.
0;Single player mods + Story is worth it alone. Online is great for and gigs but much better with friends (at least 2 3)Edit June 17 2017With Rockstar (Take Two) effectively killing off modding for Single Player I can't recommend this game at the price it currently stands. 60 for a game pushing 2 years on PC and 4 years for Console is just asinine and what kept it going (modding) is gone. Get your SP fix and then get out of there.
0;After getting bored of single player and annoyed with the microtransation garabge GTA online had become I bought the PC version for mods.But now they have stopped that in an attempt to get more people playing online and spending more real money on the game. Sorry your game 'only' cost $70 and is one of the best selling games of all time. The price gouging has go to stop before you lose more long time customers.
0;So my previous review was positive until they destroyed the main way of modding. They want us to ay online when it's full of toxic kids that teleport you and slaughter you. And single player moding is the thing they need to change? Sort your priorities right. As for new players don't buy the game. Spend it on a different game.
0;All I want in this game is to play a closed session with my friends with nothing but a few car re textures that do not effect anyone negatively. However Take2 decided that we can't have nice things and instead they will shove microtransactions down our throats and let North Korea and their nukes rule the online lobbies (hackers). This is why I will not reccommend this game Take2 is greedy lazy and all they want is your money!
0;"""Mods make the games better. Rockstar &amp Take Two are making the games worse. This is only one of the reasons why """"triple A"""" games are bad nowadays. Big companies like Blizzard Rockstar EA Ubisoft BioWare.. they all want to just make money they don't give a about making a good game. Don't buy this crap!"""
0;A Bad system that resets everything from modding once and not give a chance to the modder. I got banned for a month and all my stuff got reseted because of just Modding and 500+ hours wasted on this piece of s*** game. Not worth the time to play on this game and lose everything for just modding. ROCKSTAR IF YOU ARE READING THIS I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH YOUR GAME.
0;"""Actually i want to buy this game again for the second account. suddenly bad news cameout from T2 and R* for shuting down gta v mod so i decided not to play this game anymore and just wait for gta 6 comeout """"maybe"""". Thanks. FeelsBadMan..... ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ( ("""
0;This game is pretty awesome and there are plently of things to do. The overwelming issue with this game is that online has a hacker in pretty much any server you find. Plus when you try to get anything done online you will have to fight off 4 or more people that for no better reason wants to kill you over and over till you leave the server. Last thought Thank you community of GTA Online.
0;I take this to a positive review when take two stops being such a massive ing So in this game you play as a developer and company named Rockstar who are held hostage. The takers are these greedy scumbags who don't see the true potential of having an open market. They want communism and to control everything to come and those who speak up against it are boned.
0;"""Great game bad company.Microtransactions modding SINGLEPLAYER banned with the cease and desist on OpenIV online hackers that they are doing nothing about and Take Two's CEO is """"convinced that from an industry point of view that they are probably under monetizing on a per user basis in every part of our business.""""This review's purely negative because of the terrible buisness practices.If you're in it for singleplayer have a great time but otherwise watch out."""
0;I like this game I really do. I did have quite some fun in the multiplayer. But I prefer single player and mods. And Take2 seems to refuse to support the former with additional content and outright banned the latter.So yeah if you still don't have it don't bother.
0;This Game is an amazing one. If you dont have any other system to play it on sure buy it on here. But know You wont be able to play online properly and now you aren't allowed to Mod singleplayer as TakeTwo has said It is illegal now. They sent a Cease and Desist to the creators of OpenIV which was used for many many mods for the game and now you can't. IF you came to PC expecting to mod GTAV you can kiss that dream goodbye.
0;for as long as it worked it was a fun game. But as of now the game is unplayable as it freezes every second on my GTX 780 TI and therefore do not recommend this game as it does not bloody work. R* pls fix.Edit Still does not work as of July 25th 2016.Edit Still does not work on GTX 1080 as of September 23rd 2016Edit Fixed by rockstar running on GTX 1080 as of November 11th 2016Edit Does not work anymore on GTX 1080 as of September 6th 2017
0;I reviewed this game originally saying how amazing it is. However the recent stance on DLC has made me very leery of any future products by Take Two. Unfortunately Shark Cards have effectively ruined what should have been one of the best games in the world...
0;The single player game is great. But GTA Online is filled with microtransactions(shark cards) balance issues hackers and many technical problems.They're keeping content from the single player mode and now decided to attack the game's modding community. Messed up practices like seen here should be stopped the industry as a whole suffers because of it.
0;The key reason for my enjoyment of this game is to allow me to change the experience through mods. Playing the same game even a sandbox game over time grow old and push its users away. The only reason this game still has such high sale numbers years since its release is thanks to the modding community. This move to kill modding custom single player experiences has made me decide that I will not be making another purchase of any title under Take Two Interactive.
0;I absolutely love this game but anything that Rockstar/2k/Take Two is currently being boycotted until they are no longer going on a witch hunt against modders.Mods are the most important part of video games it's how potential developers discover they like programming.I will no longer be purchasing from either Take Two or Electronic Arts. they have clearly stated that they have no interest in selling their products.
0;The publishers have recently stopped people being able to use Open IV. They basically removed all mods that let you change how things look all just to push people over to the multiplayer. The multiplayer that is filled with micro transactions! If you used mods and/or bought this game on PC FOR the mods leave a negative review. If this game gets enough negative reviews it will get the attention of the press and then only then do we have a chance of getting our mods back!
0;Anyone who kills an open source freely available community project that has likely contributed towards people's interest in the game should not get the support of the community.It's quite obvious they have lost the support of the community which is a shame as I distinctly remember past GTAs and the large modding community that brough me back over and over.
0;While pretty fun the cashgrabbing of the developers and the shutdown of the modding community is having me give this game a negative score.Especially when you look at the still high pricetag.If you play this game you're going to encounter an artificial paywall where you must spend money on microtransactions just to have the nice stuff.
0;this game was amazing with the offline I said OFFLINE mods. without OpenIV this game sucks don't buy and I will clearly never purchase another game with those dill holes running R.....really made this game suck guys. Very dissappointed! Turns out this is just a money scam anyway save your dollars and break their bank for a change!
0;Update Based on recent news the father company stray away from us gamer.I really like the game but the company's attitude make me choose bad review offline (story mode) simply the best sophisticated story telling and trevor is crazy dudeonline i get out of apartment walking a few seconds some random dude start killing me
0;I personally would leave a positive review BUT. This anti modding is taking my intrest off in this game. like im on rank 39 i got 1 2 million cash i log out of my accont. next day firs thing i see is '' we have corrected your account 1200000$'' i go to game itself RANK 34... very nice. This is the reason this game got from ''mostly positive'' to ''overwhelmingly negative''. im not sure if im seeling good to play this anymore...
0;I had a lot of good to say about this game but now I wont bother. Rockstar is banning for mods in single player and that is unacceptable therefore I cannot recommend this game anymore.UPDATE Rockstar have come out and clarified that they are not banning for mods on single player. Rejoice!UPDATE 2 Well it looks like Take Two have ****ed us over and has shut down OpenIV. **** you Take Two.
0;With the ban of singleplayer mods recent events have shown how much of a Cashgrab Take Two and Rockstar have made this game. The constant updates to Online mode and how much money is required to actually have a decent amount of fun in addition to the difficulty and grinding required to make the actual money microtransactions are necessary if you want to play meaning it's garbage.
0;It was a phenomenal game until Take Two decided to cuck the players who bought the games multiple times (PS3 to PC) just to Mod and have fun in single player where the game is so much more limited than the multiplayer which is flooded by microtransactions that take even more away from the game.
0;Truth be told i love this game and find it very enjoyable to play. I also enjoy modding the the game to enhance my single player experience. however take two has recently declared modding illegal because they obviously are too greedy and want even more money so im letting them know how i feel about their decision...
0;"""Rockstar and Take 2 Interactive for killing the mod scene on this game. A lot of people bought this game for the PC for the sole reason of modding you are killing the single player so you heads can make more money on your poor backwater garbage that you call """"GTA Online"""" As if having the 4th best selling game doesn't give you enough money greedy s. Avoid buying this game if you care about community creativity."""
0;I am a massive fan of the GTA series and thoroughly enjoyed GTA V but somewhere along the line it changed all focus shifted towards GTA Online and that has become a cesspool grinding gameplay and microtransactions this has sucked all life and joy from the game making it a husk of its former self.This coupled with the recent attack against modding I simply cannot justify any reason to buy this game.
0;GG T2 singlehandedly killed off the modding scene which is the main reason people bought it for PC.GTA Online is terrible there is no fun in it anymore and you have to buy stupid shark cards to have fun or even be able to have anything nice whereas with single player I can have whatever I want and use the map as my sandbox however now that you've killed OpenIV I can no longer do that and therefore will no longer be playing your game. Well done Take 2 well done.
0;It is such a good game but the single player has been left to rot there is now verry little mods for the game thanks to take 2 recent actions . Due to this i can not recomend this game to anyone. When will take 2 learn that not everyone wants to play online all of the time
0;I used to be a big fan of this game. I bought it on Xbox 360 for the single player Xbox One for the online with friends and then a third time here for mods. I know many other people who have done the same thing. Apparently $200 isn't enough so now they're taking the mods away. If I could refund the PC version now I would. All in all this version looks like it's turning into a waste of $60.
0;This game is a great game. The devs for shutting down modders that aren't infringing on their profits not so much. A lot of great games and game modes spawn from the things modders make and this will only serve to stifle that creativity. I cannot recommend this game to any one anymore because one of the best things about a pc is the ability to be able to mod the things the way you want to have them.
0;On Behalf of the millions on millions of people that spent about 100NZD for this game a third time to mod it. no. Enough is Enough Take Two. take your stupid modding policy and get stuffed. By the way Take Two easy way to fix this. DONT THREATEN THE BIGGEST MODDING COMMUNITY ON THE INTERNET
0;I bought this game on the PS3 for $60 when it came out. Then I bought it on the PS4 for $60 for the first person mode and the enhanced visuals. THEN I bought it on the PC for 60 f***ing dollars just to MOD IT. Mods are now effectively dead for this game because Take Two sent out a cease and desist order to OpenIV an essential modding tool for the game. They are trying to push micro transactions in multiplayer. Don't stand for this don't buy this game.
0;After the recent actions by take two trying to crush the modding community to premote muntiplayer micro transactions I cannot reccoment bying this game or any other take two products. This is simply wrong. This game has been sold 3 times to so many people ENOUGH with the cash grab it is absolutly ludicrous.
0;Great game to get killed dozens of times by random players passive mode will only work on foot so whats the point of using that..Other than that story mode is pretty cool and would recommend playing that than GTAV online.It's like saints row but with drugs.EDIT Modding is illegal F.
0;Take Two F*cks over the PC community big time.Whilst a great story and the most beautifull urban Open World do convince gameplay wise it's publisher continues milking the pay to win system with it's ridiculous cashcards and now aggressivly prosecutes the games biggest fans The modding Community.Not recommendable.
0;"""Latest updates contain overpriced cars that force people to either mod Online or buy Shark Cards.Such a ing disappointment Rockstar EDITThey've now given a cease and desist to the creators of OpenIV the most common single player modding tool meaning that modding the single player is """"illegal"""". So where are we now? We have a company who wants more money after making billions a micro transaction riddled online gamemode and now a story mode. Nice I recommend! Go yourselves Take2."""
0;Great single player... untill they decided to screw with it just to get more money from the Online (which btw to this day STILL sucks).Since most people were modding the single player because it's a freaking PC GAME they decided to cease and desist the modders because they don't get ENOUGH MONEY. WHAT?STAY AWAY from ANY TAKE TWO games
0;Milking microtransactions banned modding in singleplayer to move players to the exclusive multiplayer items where you must pay real money to get the latest add ons if you don't want to spend all day(earth day) grinding money just for that but multiplayer is not a nice place to enjoy your car to say the least. You could have modded it in to not pay for updates in singleplayer. Well the story is allright but that is not worth 60 euro alone that's why there was modding but now there isn't
0;Take Two are for forcing OpenIV to stop. The Online is a total POS grindfest full of ridiculous microtransactions which lock away most of the content that they've added since release. No DLC other than online since release.Singleplayer decent.Pretty graphics.
0;Given Take Two's recent decision after ten years to send cease and desist orders to the creators of OpenIV the group that actually made GTA IV playable on PC and undeniably helped make GTAV as popular as it is on this platform I will not be recommending this game to anyone. Ever. I sincerely hope that either Take Two reverse this idiotic decision or go out of business entirely.
0;"""""""The definitive version of GTAV. Even better with mods. 10/10"""" was the review I published some time before Take Two Interactive decided to stick their into the GTAV modding scene and things up beyond all repair. If Take Two does not change their poilcy on modding soon then I swear to pirate every single new game they release from then on."""
0;Taketwo has said modding is illegal and I basically bought this game because there would be mods for it.I can't reccomend this game if you can't use mods. It's a grinding multipayer and the singleplayer doesn't even have everything in it (Hydra for example)
0;you sticks took away the only reason millions of people still play your game online is unless you buy overpriced shark cards singleplayer is short and boring online community is garbage NO ONE CAN ING BUY ANYTHING IN MULTIPLAYER UNLESS YOU SPEND HOURS ON THIS GAME DAILY WHICH QUITE FRANKLY NO ONE HAS TIME FORdon't bother buying this
0;"""I said it before and I will say it again DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS. Not when Rockstar can arbitrarily suspend and ban you without explanation. Their Rockstar """"Support"""" is nothing but automated responses. Once they decide to ban you you lose. Game over. No chance for a refund. I had no mods. No exploits and they've banned me even though I have bought multiple copies of this game across multiple systems for friends and bought Shark Cards. I completely regret giving even a penny to this company."""
0;Take Two is a underhanded backstabbing greedy micro transaction filled POS generic garbage trash boys who like bending customers over and giving them a fist sized colonoscopy bunch of corporate suits who give it to each other left right and center all in the name of team training.R.I.P OPEN IV
0;"""Bought this game twice. Once for 360 once for PC. Both times full price. And now because they apparently aren't """"monetising"""" their customers enough they have killed the modding scene setting a dangerous precedent for modding in general.Uninstalling and vowing to not buy T2 games again. Shame as I was looking forward to being forced to purchase GTA VI four times in the future."""
0;the SP modding scene is now dead by take two (R* parent company) got lawyers towards open IV also online is trash and filled with micro transactions being shoved down your throat. Good job take two you killed this games PC fan base and gave your sub companies a bad name
0;"""This game used to be really fun but now I feel like it's dying. Since Take Two took down Open IV which is a massively used modding tool to make the game more fun modding is no longer a thing. GTA games are about 50% story and 50% mods to make it more fun. Take Two just thought """"We should take down Open IV so that people are forced to play our repetitive and then get bored out of there minds! That will be great for business!"""" Take Two more like Take everything."""
0;The recent removal of OpenIV the key modding resource for nearly all mods in GTAIV and GTAV along with the amount of cheating and hacking in the online portions of the game have turned Grand Theft Auto V from an enjoyable game with potential for years to come in to an embarrassing example of how to manage a community that rams micro transactions down its customers throats. Not to mention the fact that the same customers have already paid 39.99 / 40.00 for the game.
0;I don't write reviews. I don't. It's just not my thing. But when you start screwing with my fellow gamers start ruining their experience and think that you can get a recommendation out of me... you're wrong.Eat this negative review. You'd better fix your sh*t.
0;We want mods. Stop being Take Two. Just let us mod the damn game its half the fun. I can understand stopping some of the multiplayer mods especially the ones that can help you cheat but no one buys a Rockstar game or Bethesda game and DOESN'T mod it. You're buying it for the ridiculous antics you plan to get up to. Stop killing the video game industry.
0;I don't mod GTAV. It's just not something I do. Sure mods are great but I've never had the desire to use them. That being said the audacity of Take Two is mind blowing. To shut down a vital program in mod making basically making mods illegal is one of the dumbest things they could have possibly done. I enjoy the game but the fact that they're removing the option of mods is rage inducing.
0;take 2 and their attacking of the community. I mostly only play single player so I was already fed up with take 2s t and openiv is the only reason I have continued playing at all. I will never purchase another take 2 game and will not be playing gta v anymore. you take 2
0;TakeTwo has just become even more greedy. I got bored of online and there for came to moding cause not only is the modding commuity great but they also keep gta 5 alive still for me.. but thank you taketwo i wont be touch gta 5 again! and i m sorry to all the modders who put there time into gtaThank you modders
0;"""I'm purely here to spread this t that take two interactive have persued i mean seriously spread this and every single person should press no to """"do you reccomend this game?"""" i mean if you haven't seen this t then go to nearly every news youtuber probably even the Keem Star btw i suggest Nerdcubed or Jim Sterling they have very good opinions about this particular issue"""
0;Shark cardsShark cardsNo mods mods are badShark cardsShark cardsBuy our game 3 timesRockstar/take two have ruined a great game between the c&amp d to modders the shark cards for online and the lack of any type of focus on the single player.Done with take two and rockstar.
0;2K just killed OpenIV which printing mats means the end for Gta modding and on top of that 90% of the flc content is not available in single player and the multilayer is designed to drive people crazy with teddies and annoying tasks if you want to get money for the dlc content for free and make people buy the ridiculously expensive shark cards. Ower all I'm dissapointed... NerdCubed's pinion https //youtu.be/0gKlBIPR_ok
0;This game was awesome but recently when i tried revisiting the game i couldn't due to using mods (OpenIV)I uninstalled reinstalled only to find out online that its due to take 2 no longer supporting mods. (I'll deffinatly re recommend this game once they bring back mod support
0;I've owned this game on 360 XBOX ONE and PC but after what TAKE TWO has done to OPENIV I'm done with it. Complete bull**** that they did this after all these years. I kept my copy on XBOX for when I wanted to play GTA Online and got the PC version for LSPDFR and now they're trying to ruin to modding community...so for this I'm done with Rockstar games unless this changes. Everyone should boycott their games until they learn to leave the harmless modding communities alone. #SAVEOPENIV
0;I guess Take Two would rather focus on screwing over gamers than actually fixing the problems with their games. I'm not blaming R* here this is all on Take Two. I won't be buying any of their games from this point forward unless something changes in a MAJOR way.
0;Storymode is great. GTA Online is ruined by microtransactions. Take Two has just proven they are no longer considerate or accepting of the modding community. This is a very bad sign for both the current and future GTA games along with any other games from Take Two or one of their subsidiaries. Basicly put don't buy this.
0;Absolutely ing unacceptable. Mods are important to the gaming community. It drives games forward. And if you pay this much for a ing video games you should own it right? Any publisher or developer that is actively working against single player modders is a complete rip off. Don't buy this game.
0;Now it must stop take two. It is now time to stop with all microtransactions t and the torm of gta online content. The only thing I think is fun about this game after so long. To modding it And that's the only thing that has kept the game going on for so long ..... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME TAKE TWO WILL ONLY HAVE YOUR MONEY and not interested in making the single player game more fun for you
0;mothe ing games like all service of steam support thanks... i7 GTX 750 TI impssoible to channge some settings steam support are ignore s me messages when im royal client of ur ... this is not messages whos should whrite support becase of bad wrongs i know but i already ed up my nerves...
0;Bland boring singleplayer bland boring multiplayer and in order to mod the game to be good you have to actively fight the updates which just add stupid to the multiplayer pay to win grindfest.And apparently people are just noticing how much they hate mods.
0;Take Two have awoken sleeping lions... None of this bad publicity will ruin you i know because it has happened before hasnt it... Oh well..These guys never fail to amaze me.. I love your game and have spent way more hours than i should have on it... and I have bought it 3 seperate times.. one time was for the single player mods... haha... welp... screw that one then. Im guessing you'll have a shark card sale soon huh? yeah good luck with that..
0;Modding games is an essential part of the end user's experience. Once we purchase the product from them they should have no right to affect what we can do with their product so long that it does not affect other players. (In reference to modding in online enviornments.) Shame on Take2.
0;Rockstar stopped supporting singleplayerInstead they make DLC for online (witch sucks too) so 12 year old kids go buy shark cards because otherwise it takes 200 hours to get decent weapons/armour car and appartment (not to mention lots of other stuff)
0;Update 2 Modding might be back but for how long? Take Two has lost my trust and my support. I wont be changing my recommendation for this game or getting any future games from them. Sad really I was looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2. Oh well I'll find something else to play.Update Reported for moddability tag. With the ban on OpenIV modding is no longer a proper tag for this game.Greedy company ruins game. Goodbye GTA5 and goodbye Take Two I wont be supporting you anymore.
0;In light of recent events I'm changing my review.However much I dislike the online hackers give them single player ability to mod just as you let single player mode cheat. As I stated as much as I dislike the shenanigans the hackers pull I will stand with the people.R* LET THEM MOD!
0;Single player is a great experience for the playthrough. HOWEVER the game has become increasingly difficult to play with other people. If you want to have any fun with this game online you'll need to find a solo public lobby. Otherwise you will just be trolled constantly if you try to do things like gunrunning I/E MC stuff or crates. Rockstar used to take an anti greifing policy against this but now they encourage it.
0;I left a possitive review on this game as in itself it's a really good game however when you're getting banned from the online portion of the game for using mods entirely in single player it's pretty stupid. If you were planning to BUY this game to mod it don't!

So i tried new cunning stunts gets smashed off the road by people going backwards.Reporting people dose nothing.Edit Moders are being given legal cease and desist orders for single player mods so if you have thought about getting this for mods then DONT.

0;DO NOT BUY THIS TAKE TWO HAS NOT ONLY RUINED THIS GAME BY MILKING IT THROUGH MICROTRANSACTIONS BUT HAS ALSO BANNED MODDING THE GAME (which by the way is one of the reasons many people bought it on PC).And also I strongly reccomend you don't buy this game or any game made by Take Two until they reverse their decision and even then that's not guaranteed.
0;I would not personally buy this game ever again.Banned 1st time for literally no idea why.Banned 2nd time perma for a modder dropping cash on me (20k) Waited 40 Mins on phone to get nowhere with them.Waste of $40 and $50+ in shark cards.If you dont mind gettting reset alot then you will enjoy this

0;Just bought this with the expectation that I would be able to mod it and not be forced to play the broken AF online for new content. And its too late for a refund. Thanks Take Two. Cant wait to see how you handle that new IP you just aquired without the modding community. KSP would not be anywhere near the game it is without them. PCMR never forgets.
0;I just tried the most addicted drug right now called GTA V you guys should definitely try it too.Edit Just heard from Reddit that the publisher Take Two is heavily against modding.To be honest I'm not a modder and I don't use mods at all.But as a PC gamer who love PC gaming have to defend what makes PC gaming good.Will probably change it back to thumb up if I heard anything changes if only there will be a change.
0;"""GTA was once a great franchise. But now it reminds me of a free to play mobile game. Many players enjoy playing LSPDFR and other fantastic community made mods..

0;This game is good and fun it is it really is. If you are looking to play it in it's current state then buy it by all means this is one of the best games i've played. But the modding made this game fun and fresh. And so.. i give this game a bad review....
0;Rockstar focuses more time going after people who hack money rather than going after real game breaking issues like hackers being able to disconnect you from the server hackers being able to instant head shot hackers being able to force you out of an armored vehicle so they can kill you and other game breaking issues.They took a great game and ruined it.
0;I bought this game and enjoyed playing with some (gasp!) user created mods. Now that the publisher has decided to flex their legal muscle on frankly questionable grounds I can no longer recommend or endorse purchasing their products. I would ask for a refund if I were still within the window to do so.
0;Such a shame they are against modding. I've always been fairly dissappointed in Rockstar considering how cheap and lazy they are in their attempts to regulate online by using error prone automated banning systems. Their attack on modding has dropped them to a whole new low. Now they are next door neighbors with Ubisoft.
0;EDIT2 Thanks rockstar for screwing over the modding community...EDIT They fix it. GTA 5 is a fun game when it works which is a rare occurrence. I can't play more then 40 min. with out the game crashing my computer (have to force shut off). Also it kicks me if I'm idle for like 3 min. like when riding in a car just letting someone drive. Very disappointing. (
0;Singleplayer experience is top notch.However I feel bad about supporting a company which has proven itself to only care about the micro transactions literally nothing else.The whole multiplayer is a cashgrab through microtransactions... It's not about playing together experiencing GTA together with your friends It's about you buying shark cards in order to buy cool cars ingame...Can't support rockstar if RDR2 is anything like this I'll have to skip it completely.
0;Grand Theft Auto Online has devolved into a microtransaction/grinding borefest. It was marginally enjoyable at the start but no more. 2K's decision to remove GTA5's modding capabilities has removed any long lasting appeal of this game Online mode does NOT suffice. Avoid this game if mods are still not allowed or until Online gets a much needed change of priorities.
0;by making it as difficult and tedious as possible to grind in Online they force you to buy shark cards and set the prices insanely high. with hackers still around a lot online is most of the times unplayable including bad latency player all around.and now they just essentially banned modding for this game including for SINGLE PLAYER MODE!
0;Loved this game so much. The modding community supported it to the limit and Take2 wants to stop them. Rockstar games's games and gta are dead on pc if take2 doesn't support mods.They also let the cheaters ruin the online experience and forced honest players to buy Shark Cards to reach the money needed for the expensive veichles. I'll never support them again if they don't reverse their decision.
0;I only brought this game on my PC to play on single player mode with mods due to the recent f**k up by TakeTwo i have uninstalled and won't be playing again... I would advise anybody not to bother purchasing this anymore they couldn't care less about their consumers and fans only profits and shark cards and i'm not interested go to hell TakeTwo and take your legal sh*t with you )
0;Take two screwed up when they shutdown modding tools like OpenIV. I love this game. With a few mods the game becomes next level. That was one of the most anticipated aspects of GTA5. People waited for months for mod tools to be released. When Take Two decided to have them removed they significantly reduced the fan base for this game. BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!
0;Game was fun when it lasted but i feel that since take two just thinks modding the only thing keeping gta v alive rn is not a good thing and they keep releasing these bad dlcs like people actully care about gta v online if u wanted to people to care about ur online game how about u change the 10 hour loading screen!!!!!!!!! uninstalled gta v and will never install it again and will NOT BE BUYING any take two game clearly dont care about the community just there wallet
0;Is there any explanation that i should write here? Take2 you have done it. Can you learn from other mistake about taking down the modding community? If for some reason you did not know what im talking about. Take2 took down the biggest mod for GTA5 which is called OpenIV that is ESSENTIAL to the modding community.
0;Take Two.They have proven via a take down notice to OpenIV they do not give a about gamers or why people enjoy the games they publish. Do not buy this game doing so sends a message to publishers that scummy acts like threatening to sue modders is not only OK but will be supported with more purchases. They cant do about all the hackers but feel the need to threaten legal action to modders. take two they have lost a customer.
0;I bought this game specifically for mods. It is a modding paradise and very few games are like that. Take Two has ended my love for Grand Theft Auto 5. Taking down Open IV kills the game for millions of players. I only use GTA V for the world because all I play is LSPDFR. Now it seems that's over with. Thanks TT you killed the PC version of this game.
0;"""With Take Two's recent modding community massacre affecting about all mods on GTA5 I cant recomend this game. The sole reason GTA5 was so popular in the first place was becuase of the modding community if they want to be greedy money grabbers and say """"Hey we're not making enough money even though we got plenty already we should kill off the best part of the game so we can make more"""" then there is just no point. Thumbs down Take Two!"""
0;I had been debating for a while if i should buy GTA5 for the 3rd time for my pc since I built a new one. I did some research into modding the game and the mods sold me on it so i shelled out another $60 for the game however after owning it for only a month take two killed the mod support and now the game is just the same thing I played 3 years ago. I really wish i could get a refund so I could spend my money on something else instead of this.....
0;This one's for OpenIV. 2K and Rockstar. All we are to them is cash cows. They claim they don't monotize players enough. What a pile of wank.Their awful practices have made gamers buy this game 3 times. PC players were only treated to the game after several YEARS. The game has been out for 3 years and is still a 60 dollar title. What a bunch of money hungry Jews.
0;I totally understand not allowing mods in gta online take two but i paid for my game all $60 dollars of it and if i want to mod my singleplayer game then i should have that right sell your shark cards to gta online players i have no interest or do i ever intend on purchasing one i do not recommend to buy this game
0;if you wanna buy this game to play online then please don't online is full of cheaters/modders and if you're not willing to pay at least 200$ to get in game money then please just dont buy it.plus you get banned for no reason.but if you wanna buy this game to play single player with mods then i really recommend buying it
0;All they care about is money. They took away modding from the game to attempt to make more of it disregarding almost all of it's PC fanbase. Please do not give them more money by buying this game as it is dead without modding. GTA V Online is boring as every DLC that they release has rediculously expensive content and almost forces you to buy their Shark Cards. There we see again more money wanted by the devs. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME PLEASE
0;very buggie game i have purchase the shark cards (3) and all of them crashed my game and i didn't get the cash and a lot of the race map are not 100% there is bug's on the track's where are cars and bikes will just stop there is a very big prob with moder hacking the game and rockstar is not doing anything about it
0;After seeing what take two did I dont support this game or their practices. Alos this is negative because im sick of the t hacking and the way they have ignored your single player experience. They banned modding so that now you have to go online to enjoy that online bull.
0;Don't with mods Take Two you gain nothing and you lose the trust and support of your consumers and customers. Rescind the cease and desist against OpenIV. Healthy mod support can only increase PC sales and benefit PR especially something like OpenIV which is non malicious. Get your heads out of your asses and fix this.
0;Adding Take Two and Rockstar to the list of companies where I WILL NEVER BUY A GAME FROM AGAIN. GTA V has always been to ing grindy to then have to spend almost all of your moneny on endlessly increasing prices on everything in the game. Forget it. I shouldn't have to put in 40 hours a week to afford a plane a car or a bunch of clothes. Then on top of it the down right selfish move to ban modding. you.
0;They should have put you in a glass jar on a mantlepiece. Where were you when Rockstar was suckling at his mother's teat? Where were you? Who was nursing you poor Take Two? One of Bandy's sows? That land has been had. Nothing you can do about it. It's gone. It's had.
0;WIth the axing of OpenIV the biggest online hacking prevention singleplayer modding!!!!! The online will be sure to degrrade even more.Axing a simgleplayer mod will just encourage people to either ruin the multiplayer with hacks or stop playing all together.
0;It's a great game but... just do yourself a favor and get it on console.The number of hackers/modders that infest online mode is just unreal. At least once a day you're guaranteed to be teleported around blown up or be hunted down by a 12 year old kid in godmode. The community is SUPER toxic and they all kill on sight most of the time.So if you want to enjoy this game to the fullest... just get it on console and play it with friends.
0;This game was good until the developers and publishers started getting greedy. I lost my money getting banned from online just so they can keep selling their their in game money and so I would be forced to buy another copy which I didn't. Rockstar and Take Two deserve the negative feedback they are getting hopefully they'll learn.
0;"""Do not get this game I have downloaded ALL 66.9 Gigabytes for the game. And just shortly after it being finished installing I tried to launch the game. About 5 seconds into opening the game it crashes. There is no fix for this error. If you are planning on getting this game do yourself a favor. It won't work. Rockstar offers no support on this matter and basically says """" you thanks for the 60.00 dollars."""
0;Every patch is increasingly designed to not be able to be played to it's fullest extent through in game methods. The aggressive stance toward modding doesn't change the fact that micro transactions are becoming all but necessary to enjoy the content we already paid for when we purchased the GTA5 base game.
0;I'm following people 3But seriously Rockstar and TakeTwo are company. They treat their players like and take on them. Just go bankcrupt already you banned innocent people and now banning modders in OFFLINE games.People are prefer playing GTA V offline because of the mods. But now...
0;TakeTwo banned modding on this game which was the best thing after beating the SP. And even though they reversed the ban my opinion stays the same. Besides online mode is still a grind fest focused on microtransactions and is full of cheaters and no effort is being put into it.
0;Single player was awesome multiplayer sucks if you dont like grinding for money or buying sharkcards for absurd prices.edit Take Two Interactive sent a cease and desist letter to makers of Open IV a popular modding tool that has been around for almost 10 years and causing singleplayer modding to shut down. That is just absurd. Their goal with this is for people to start playing online mode and to buy stupidly expensive sharkcards if they dont want to grind hundreds of hours for ingame money .
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEGames rely heavily on a user fanbase. When you say you to your players especially those who have spent time trying to curate mods to enhance other's experience for you that's just disgusting. Hate to give this game a negative review but T2 and R* have really really ed up. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
0;Inbred take two bustards who are clearly trying to be funny. They are not content with over 2 billion dollars and they still want more by banning modding for single player and forcing everyone to go online...Shoot these scums of society and exterminate their families as well!!! Do not buy any more games from them!!!
0;"""I bought this game to mod it and now that Take Two has """"banned"""" mods it's not worth it. I think this is a waste of money without the mods. Mods make this game what it is and Take Two needs to understand that. Don't buy this game if you've already bought this on PS4 or Xbox One."""
0;take 2 interactive. You cant just drop modding off a game 4 years after release you dumb s. Its not fair to the people that have enjoyed the mod experiance since release and its not fair to anyone that has bought or would buy this game after dropping mods as they are missing out on part of the game that has made this game great.
0;I only bought this game on Steam mainly for mods Take 2 should recognize how massive this modding community is and it is only going to ruin themselves because of theyre own greed. Screw Take 2!!! And Rockstar if they can find another publisher and accept modding like bethesda. I will not support another Take 2/Rockstar until they drop the cease and desist order against OpenIV. Over 830 hrs played since launch!!!
0;It's a cool game with fantastic singleplayer online has a few issues with cheaters but it's not as rampant as others make it out to be.HOWEVER at the moment literally everything on the market is overpriced making it an overall grind fest. And the publisher removed the ability to harmlessly mod the game.
0;Previous Grand Theft Auto games have mostly been romanticized crime stories with a perfect hint of satire.But now in place of a heroic bank robber's tale we instead have the tale of a mid life crisis.GTAV is a tryhard social commentary about modern life. It's basically Facebook tier drama and about as entertaining as drivng to Walmart and asking people about their personal problems.And in between the boring events of the story you drive cars. Can't forget that!
0;Take 2 (Rockstar's parent company) sent C&amp D letter to GTA and Max Payne modding tool everything on the online aspect is highly expensive just to make you buy their money cards so they can print even more money. Sadly I cannot get my money back anymore as it has been 2 years since the purchase but hoping whoever reads this doesn't support this kind of behavior by giving money to them.
0;Take Two screwed up. OpenIV did nothin g legally wrong and Take Two sent them a cease and desist because they said it was illegal. Take Two basicaly repeated the Nintendo v Game genie case from the 80's. Game Genie one that case and if openIV had chosen to take them to court there was a 100% chance that OpenIV would have one aqianst Take Two. Rebel against Rockstar and Take Two DON'T BUY ANY OF ROCKSTARS AND TAKE TWO'S GAMES UNTIL THEY GET THERE ACT TOGETHER!
0;I've had it with this game. Not only Online is a complete ripoff nowadays where you can't have fun because of all the warfare going on ALL the time but they now are cutting down the Single Player??? The game that you actually paid $60 for?!? Seriously check out the car store in single player they took away like most of the cars you can't even peacefully customize rides in solo mode.F%*()#* Rockstar
0;Online is useless unless you spend hours and hours grinding for money and XP or spend 100's of real world dollars just to get the entities needed to have a fun free roam experience with friends.Singleplayer is useless because TakeTwo is a whiny about mods.It's pretty bad when ol' Uncle Donnie up at the White House has a better approval rating than your company.
0;Came back for the first time in ages as there was more to do and that heists had been made a bit easier due to updates etc and was having a blast finally bought my first office for 1million and a bullet proof car ! Won a reversing challenge i was a winner Came on today suspended wih reset.........awesome....
0;Has an amazing anticheat system that bans innocent players while leaving people with millions in hacked money or a mod menu that nukes the entire lobby every 15 seconds untouched.You like playing games where YEARS of progress can be taken away for literally nothing with no explanation? This is the game for you.
0;Do not waste money on this game I can say that after 1200 hours of gameplay. You'll just end up getting banned for no reason because of the faulty software and won't be able to do anything. Rockstar has the worst customer support in the gaming industry itself. If you have that extra 60 euros and don't know what to do with them it'd be better if you gave them to the first homeless person you see than to buy this game.
0;After being aback for a week I have begun to have fun once again in los santos. yes there have been a few encounters with cheaters but in all honesty it hasn't been all that bad. mostly I played with friends in private lobbies. then the false ban wave hit and i'm caught up in unneccessary t with no way to make my voice heard. after f inding out that so many others have the same issue I have only one thing to say... don't buy this till rockstar fixes their
0;A friend of mine got banned for no reason. Apparently R* is running some broken anti cheat detection software and is just banning thousands of innocent players. Meanwhile people who are still cheating are still able to play. I'm not going to log in until they resolve this issue.Until they fix their s&amp t I won't recommend this game.https //www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/86q5lj/032318_gta_online_ban_wave_what_we_know_so_far/
0;GTA Online. A true WoW killer in terms of the Grind. Expect to sink thousands of hours if your hoping to own property or exotic cars. Public lobbys on the PC are also extremely harsh for new players. I'd recommend playing with friends or not at all. Hackers are also quite prevelant expect to reload your session quite often trying to avoid them. Couple this with insane load times I do not recommended this game atleast the Online experience.In the end its still just a console port.
0;I have owned this game for 3 platforms now PC 360 and PS3. PS3 and 360 were flawless examples of the game PC however plays incredibly choppy and constantly crashes. Good luck playing with friends it will drop you left and right after missions and heists. Beware Online is buggy moddy and just plain not as good as single player.
0;So this game was fun in the first few weeks when there were next to no hackers. Now every game there is a hacker in it and you almost need to hack yourself so they can crash your game. YES HACKERS CAN CRASH YOUR GAME AT WILL! I would not buy this game again it need a LOT of WORK to clean up the hackers...
0;Take Two is a garbage publisher who has no clue what they are doing. Take Two would rather have you buy shark cards and never actually enjoy the game. Modding is an inevitablity in PC gaming. Developers who take their communities in stride are often rewarded with a larger playerbase. I don't see why Take Two can't do the same. Instead they would rather threaten lawsuits against creative people who are making their game better.
0;Getting rid of OpenIV worse mistake I will never buy a game from Rockstar ever again and thouands others wont either. Thanks for ruining the streamers and the community. If I were you I wouldnt even bother making the next GTA unless OpenIV is supported.
0;Plz make a launcher that allows you to play the game with mods but offline then the option to play the game without mods online kinda like Arma 3. I've already tried deleting the game and reinstall it but it's not playable still online and it's getting real old.
0;"""I installed Ironman v1.5 mod without the knolage that if do that i will get banned when i launched it as it sais in the video i got banned for 1 week and they said my account will be resetet so i got bored of online and i got banned i have level 201 """"nice game""""."""
0;It's a shame I've had this game for so long I can't get a refund now. I bought this exclusivly for the mods but T2 have thrown their rattle out of the pram saying we as a community can't modify our own games. Well F**k you T2 I'll never buy any game you're ever associated with again.Sorry for making the games WE pay for a little more fun!
0;I would love to recomend this game I truly would but as the current state of the online which is arguably the more appealing part of the game is pretty much broken I am forced to not recomend it. By broken I refer to the laggy servers and hackers infesting the online making it pretty much unplayable at the moment.
0;If there was ever a game that made you question realality this should be at the top of that list. The world is massive and the veiw distance is unreal. Detail is everywhere in this game. The only flaw is the trolls and cheaters. Suggest playing in private mode with friends.Due to Rockstar service being garbage and unfair in everyway I have to give this game ONE star
0;Singleplayer is great but multiplayer is cancerous garbage with mechanics straight out of grindy mobile gaming Take Two is also intentionally ing over the SP by banning mods and not adding the new content to SP so that you have to buy their shark cards to play with the new content thats only in MP (Or you could grind for 6 hours for a single car/bike).I already gave you $60 why can I not play the game that I bought the way I want to play it. Take Two and RockStar.
0;went back to play gta online $10000000 i had zero after a purchase of an apartment got this from rockstar wtf now im in debt of 10000000 and like what really can i get a refund steam and rockstar plz fix your crap. this will make a great video on how take two is a dumb publisher and rockstar is not making things better looks like i get that multiplayer mod and mod all i like frick you rockstar and all you stand for i will noww be playing gta san andreas online when i get that game
0;"""I hate this game. Most of my time spent on this game it the hole that is the online mode. The online is extremely infuriating. Progress is waaaay to slow to keep you interested and you need millions of in game money to do anything that could be classed as """"fun"""". The story mode on the other hand is fantastic! However Take Two ed that part up by banning mods.TLDL Don't buy this game for the online its a hole that wants your money and doesnt give you fun in return."""
0;Shark Cards should honestly be $10 bucks for $10 million in in game money. Like 2 bucks for $1 mil 5 bucks for 4 mil 10 bucks for 10 mil and so on. If people want 100 million they can pay like 75 bucks. If R* charged these prices for their scam er I mean in game purchases then I would be more inclined to play. Too bad the other reason holding me back from playing is that online is a complete mess with hackers. R* is simply waaaaay too greedy.
0;Total dog Graphics and gameplay are amazing when the game works which is mazbe 5% of the time.It fails to lauch almost every time and crashes during gameplay most times i'v play it.I have a dual graphic MSI GT70 laptop running 4th gen i7 and a GT870 graphics card which is more than ample for this game but the game code is broken even after patches and every fix i can find!I WANT MY MONEY BACK STEAM!
0;"""they wiped my 8 million dollars after the update i grinded for that cash. i have no clue why i was wiped and now there are no mods when mods are what made this game ffs this game is how odl and the only reason people played it was because of modding i hate that ive spent so much money for the game and put into the game and i get wiped it was legit cash and im they """" gave me """" 2 grand after my wipe please fix this"""
0;Take twos actions are a classic example of a executive decision for a bunch of business men who know nothing about the game industry. It saddens me to see how often these sort of actions are being taken recently. I am glad to see however they the are paying for the ignorance for once
0;The game itself is awesome everyone should know this by now.But I'm rating it negative because of the recent cease and desist letter against the developers of OpenIV by TakeTwo.I probably also won't buy any TakeTwo game in the future anymore if they don't revert that.
0;Single Player is great but if you want to do Online heists you have to have 4 friends otherwise they become almost impossible due to Australia lag since online servers aren't regional.In the Prison Break heist for example cops spawn within view range and so you have to evade them before they appear almost impossible.Take Two just screwed over the modding community for this game and previous GTAs even harder than on release. Take a stand against this crappy behaviour and don't buy this game.
0;"""b0ss pls can i heb a mod?y take 2 take my chromosome how am gonna play wit myself now???""""but is business they do wut want""""no u take2 is game y u hef to b stupid???Seriously though. You guys screw the consumer because your precious Shark Card business model can't be harmed. That's just sad. 0/10 has strippers and cars but no mods"""
0;I could care less about mods honestly but I did invest some money into the online which was a HUGE mistake! Errors in the online cost me a crap load of real life currency and the customer service didn't care one bit. The single player is pretty amazing and a great addition to the GTA franchise but do to being ripped off by CROCKstar I can't recommend this game to anyone. Thanks for ripping me off!
0;The developers of this game indicated that they would be open to modding and release singleplayer DLC before the game was released. They have since gone back on their promises on both fronts in favor of their online multiplayer service. Do not purchase this game as a singleplayer experience because the company does not intend to support your.
0;Take Two dun effed up by blocking single player nodding. Actually the developers already drove me away from playing online with their inability to guarantee private sessions inability to fight online hackers without hurting innocent players the outlandish expense of in game properties and by all of their moves to get you to buy more in game money. I get that they're trying to make a buck but they already got $120 bucks out of me (copies for two different platforms).
0;Product received for free. This game is boring without mods and take two should be ashamed of themselves!!! RockSTAR!!! YOu said Modding is LEGAL yourself so do something!!! No one is going to play the boring single player version nor will day pay a ton of money to play you bullS**t online version! DO NOT RECOMMEND! GTA 5 is DEAD!!!!!!!!!
0;"""you """"Rockshit"""". I CAN'T DOWNLOAD A GOD DAMN UPDATE AND I CANNOT DO A REINSTALL BECAUSE I GET A """"CONTECNT LOCKED"""". Yeah... Please prove the coding and bull that i deserve to get this much trouble to recieve a ing update. My friends are playing why can't I?"""
0;I don 't understand you people i brought every console version NOW NO ING MODS WHO THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THIS IS TOTALLY UNJUST UN FAIR TO US YOUR COMSUMERS TAKE TWO YOU A BUNCH OF HATS THIS IS NOT RIGHT..AND I PAID FOR GTA V $60.00 FROM STEAM IM ANGERY AS
0;They keep rasing the price of in game items with each new update making it harder to buy things with earned money in game. Removing the main source of single player mods is what ruined the game for me. Not worth buying if you dont own the game but still fun to play occassionally if you already own it.
0;NOTE The singleplayer is still good. If you are buying the game for the singleplayer only then be my guest as it does still have a good singleplayer thankfullyI gave this game a good review once and yeah I still play it but it's an unbearable grindfest. They are begging for you to buy shark cards. This game has been turned into a full blown joke. I had to stop doing college work to write this review. Don't even bother.
0;OpenIV and the entire modding community breaths life into games like the GTA series that enriches or even makes it a completely new experience to play. People enjoy and buy games in the GTA series precisely BECAUSE of the eventual mods. Take Two Interactive's decision to not only take away a core aspect of the playing experience but to go after those who mod the games AS A HOBBY is both despicable and speaks volumes of their priority to make money before making a good game for the players.
0;this is a love hate relationship. If you want to grind for 600+ hours for 20 million ingame dollars (including Criminal Mastermind which is difficult and stressful af) only for for rockstar to take 12 million because of unwanted modded money being thrown on me from the army of hackers that they can't seem to fix (or don't bother to try). Also yes I tried to grind legit because if I get modded money the game is no longer fun for me.
0;This game used to be fun. Online was the best Until R* got greedy. Then modded singleplayer was the only reason I played anymore. Now that mods are illegal I can't reccomend the game because Singleplayer is boring as and multiplayer is a grindy mess in an attemp to get your money.
0;Half of you monkeys should realize that when you about online hacking that lays creed to them shutting down OpenIV. Im not saying this is the way hacks are made but it sure does help when you can reverse engineer software and minipulate code in the files. So I can only assume this will nip the hacks in the bud.
0;I until recently enjoyed GTA Online and GTA SIngle Player on another PC. Used to have fun with friends and messing around with some offline mods but T2 just runined this for no real reason and banned Open IV.I mean these mods dont effect online at all and just provide entertainment on a local PC yet T2 have decided this isnt cool so no more.I really hope Rockstar get rid of T2 as soon as possible for their own benifit.
0;Use to love this game when it first came out but now its a huge scam. Huge pay wall for new players. Miss the old days when you pay $60 for a game you get all the content. This game now u must pay 100 dollors or more to skip the months of bad grind to get a toe in the door in Online mode. This is why i like GTA 4. you pay what you get.
0;Brings back the humour that was missing from IV but has alot of wasted map space that lacks the ingenious design of III/VC/SA. Yes its big maybe not all useful. Single player is great online is a fee to play load of tripe with alot of grinding and no real gameplay (as per the current fall ingame standards). And it looks like the modding scene is about to be killed off.
0;The game frequently ing crashes and when you have spent 4 weeks trying to figure out whats wrong you get a bit stressed. (like keyboard breaking stress) I even went as far as to restore my whole disk and computer start from scratch wait for download (takes forever) and it wont even start up now... It will crash on you won't start up makes your computer run slow and everything else a enthusiast does not want.
0;GOT TO LVL 118 PLAYING LEGIT THEN GOT MONEY DROPED FROM A RANDOM DUDE AND I GOT MYSELF A 30 DAY BAN A FULL ACCOUNT RESET AFTER THAT I ENTERED THE GAME AND RECEIVED A MSG THAT I WAS PEMANET BAN BY DOING NOTHING GG ROCKSTAR OFFICIAL JUST WANT MONEY FROM SHARK CARDS AND ROCKSTAR YOU CAN YOU FVVCK YOURSELF M00THER FVVCKERS FVVCKING SCAMERS
0;GTA Online is a microtransaction piece of that requires hundreds of hours or hundreds of dollars to make signicant progress...Oh yeah and they just kill the Modding community so if you came here to to buy it so you can have fun with GTAV mods sorry your a little too late nowTAKE TWO INTERACTIVE HAS KILLED THE MODDING COMMUNITY!
0;Things have changed in GTA. What was once about a compelling story is now about selling 'cash cards' online to get players to pay more and more money. It seems that Rockstar/Take Two's objective is this online universe which I find to be lame and a complete departure from what made GTA what it is. I wouldn't bother.
0;I may have never modded this game but seriously. On behalf of the people that mod games and enjoy them with the mods that the community makes for a good time you guys Take Two. Go suck a From here on until the ban on modding has been lifted I will petition the purchase of any and all games from Take Two.
0;Great game. 10/10. Online is fantastic when there aren't hackers in the lobby. Only issue is after not playing for a month I try to load the game and it plays the animations and everything once I've loaded in for a second and then freezes for 5 10. Then it repeats that and my GPU gets hot af. I know it isn't my specs because I have a god tier computer that ran GTA V for a good amount of playtime. I looked it up and couldn't find anything. Sooooo RIP the good times. (
0;Gaming getting every single update. ( GTA ONLINE ) Base game is perfect but the online is complete horse Cheapass Payouts Expensive A F items that takes months too grind No skill Required just get a goddam armored vehicle and kill each other no guns needed. Vechile battle auto 5
0;"""Every session has more than 2 hackers. Usually they aren't """"good hackers"""" where they won't use it for combat but use it to give themselves money RP etc. no one really cares if you do that. But most of them do use it for combat and you can KICK PEOPLE OUT OF A SERVER. Why? Is there no anti cheat and does the report button not work?Single player good tho"""
0;This is a good game but absolutely unenjoyable. Once you've grinded through the original gameplay you can't do anything. The prices are ridiculous such as buying ridiculously expensive facilities for just one heist. For you to even dream of getting new content you have to pay for shark cards and even 75 for 8mil isn't going to cut it. The game is just a money grab in online...
0;Dear Take Two Most of us here bought this game on PC due to the modding possible on PC that just isnt there on console so dont take away the only thing that brought your fanbase here in the first place!#NoMoreGTATillAnswers!Your GO YOURSELFFinley McDonald
0;On one hand this game has generally been a buggy mess for me performance wise. Random crashes issues with texture pop in stuff like that. It's pretty frustrating.but you can also get a group of your best buds load down a train with a few technicals (harder than it sounds) and become a mostly unstoppable killing machine.I used to recommend this but the fact that they shut down modding is too much for me to endorse.
0;If you are there for singleplayer and modding go aheadbut for online youll get banned for modding by tar and even if you do play online youll get killed by hackers and tar does nohing about it. Rockstar made a move to make the game more expenisive before sale and give it a sale for original price. the game itself runs very well my 980tis in sli run it at 180fps avg maxed out. mods are ing awesome and thats it. Overall a bit of a disappointment but worth it.
0;The only reason gta5 is still relevant is becuase of the modding community. Take Two really messed up with their idiotic decision. I hope they come to their senses and reopen OpenIV. I spent 60 dollars on the PC version to enjoy the wonderful and creative mods made by fans. If i want to play the horrible DLC's id just go play on console. Do not get GTA5 on pc until OpenIV is back in action.
0;GTA is a nice game the graphic is nice and the game is full of full but when u are playing online there many retard player that do not cooperate sometimes i think their brain have something wrong they are totally stupid god cant save them too .....Another point is loading is very long how good is your pc still need wait so be patientnow the server become worst easy disconnecting and laggging .Hacker all around
0;Welp Rockstar And Take Two decided to fight modding in Single Player instead of fighting the problem in Multiplayer. Good job guys you sure know how to do stuff right.. So i guess its the end of GTA IV? Single player is god awful without mods and Multiplayer is filled with modders that uses Scripthook...
0;I only play the online part of the game and its actually really fun but rockstar has to deal with these modders that is ruining the gameplay for others like I had to spend a ton of money for ammos just cause a modder decided to take all of my ammos. Like come on its been 5 years since this game has been released and there's still modders walking around and instead of them being banned they just get to be youtubers.
0;I recommend this game for single player. Don't waste your money on shark cards. Online is a free to play trap. Shame that rockshit decided to exploit MP F2P grinding instead of developing single player content. It's ing t. Went from loving the game to hating it and being disgusted by rockstars actions.
0;Let me transfer my account please I was able to transfer my Xbox 360 to my pc but now I wanna transfer it to my Xbox one but I can't and I see a ton of other people complaining about it aswell but it doesn't seem like u guys care. Please fix this issue or more and more people will be complaining about it and once u do this u will get a positive review from me not a negative merry Christmas and a happy new year!!
0;this game this game is a ing dream for hackers the problem is that the littel ing kids ho play this game begg for money and the hackers kills peopel for fun with hacks and thinks they are cool and they have the abbilety to ban you from the server you know what if i could i would get my money back but i have over 430 hours play'd so i cant return it if your not a hacker dont buy this game
0;GTA 5 is a really cool game. But after 150 hours in Multiplayer you get really tired of the same old stuff... The updates are pathetic and the singleplayer isnt really good. Even if I had 150 great hours with my friends I cannot recommend it duo to it's lack of new content. Only buy it if you love the singleplayer and hate playing a long time in Multiplayer.
0;....................../ /) .................... / ../ .................../..../ ............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...') ......... .................'...../ ..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............( .............. ............. ... you rockstar &amp take two. ruined the game
0;Personally i love this game truly. But R* decides to dig into our pockets asap before they launch a new title. If you are reading this R* rework the economy of the game it's getting worse and worse everytime there's a new dlc... dont make us hate the game.
0;"""There are so many elements to this game but every aspect of this game is half Rockstar does not take any feedback from the community to better the game. Instead they say """"You're going to play it and like it. We still have your money."""" Rockstar is honestly the biggest piece of sh*t company. They're ones to shoot themselves in the foot in full auto mode when it comes to PR."""
0;Rockstar strategically placed the release of GTA V over 2 years. PS3/XBOX360 release. One year later PS4. Another year after that PC. GTA 5 has become a cash cow for Rockstar through sharkcard t. The fail to release any content worth money. They would rather put out content that is easy to make and make the in game price drastically high so that if you really want what they are putting out it would cost you 100 dollars every 3 months.
0;First of GTA V is alright but it isn't better than GTA IV let alone GTA SA !BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY F#CK ROCKSTAR GAMES ! THEY ARE GREEDY AS F#CK HAVE RUINED THE GAME WITH PAY TO WIN CONTENT AND NOW EVEN RUINED MODDING BY SENDING A CEASE AND DESIST LETTER TO THE TEAM OF OPENIV !
0;Do not recommend latest update broke the game so much so to the point that it won't even launch after logging into social club keep getting Windows error noise. Yes I have verified the integrity of the game files and apparently they're all fine would not recommend right now.
0;Been playing the game sense it came out they keeped making it harder and harder on the ones who dont cheat then they seem to reward the cheaters. Sure all the dlc was free but prices on everything in game is a joke they try to force you to buy a shark card. I wont spend real money on fake money.......Iv always loved rockstar games but after seeing how they handled this will be the last. Red dead 2 will probably be a joke also but i wont spend my cash on it unless its free or maybe like 3$.
0;I recently got this game and i've had it for the xbox one for a few years aswell as the past console 360. I can say this is a stunning version cannot get over the fact how realistic this looks even when its not at max graphics.EDIT I refuse to further support this game stopped playing it around January and I'm glad. Never going to play it again if this is where its heading.
0;Take Two wants moar money. I say nay. Let the modders be free!Edit I don't use mods with GTA myself but this is a disgrace to the gaming community at large and a slap in the face to any self respecting gamer who has ever enjoyed a mod. Take Two Interactive should be ashamed of what they've become.
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;Rockstar has never been anything more than a money hungry company who are willing to shut down the modding community entirely for the actions of a few. Modding in money online reduces the amount of money that flows to their greedy pockets. How much has the game made already? Billions? How much is enough Rockstar? Worst move any gaming company has made.
0;i mean u can still play multiplayer if u still got all the cars etc. but for new people i think it will be pretty hard to get some fun unless ur playing with a squad. and about the mods pretty dumb to remove them mods help the game before and now that u removed them it just hurt the game
0;5/10 totalSingle player 10/10Online 0/10No matter what you do online it pays nothing. Your forced to buy shark cards. This type of marketing is right up their with Korean mmo's! They have nurfed every job that use to pay well. I just recently came back to GTA. What a heaping pile of dog sh*t GTA online has become. They dont even put new online vehicles in story mode anymore. What greedy piles of sh*t!!!
0;Memory Leak makes this game unplayable bad port once again from Rockstar. Rockstar only care about console sales and if it runs when on them they don't give a about PC or are too dumb to work out the stutter bug but since we didn't get Red Dead 2 and had a shitbag port like GTA IV in the past i would think they just really really don't give a about PC aslong as they keep getting online money.
0;Product received for free. Gta5 is the best open world game in the world !But GTA 5 is online too. And there are too many cheater and Rockstar do nothing ! They sell only Online packs but the cheater are invisible and not punish.If you like this game fot singlerplayer i recommend it but GTA 5 is now only ONLINE. DONT BUY IT !!!
0;Yeah boys Rockstar support are why cos i was false banned after being unbanned so its great i put a support ticket and they closed it withing 2 mins i would rate the game 10/10 but since all the current stuff its going on 5/10 i wouldnt recommend getting this for online until the false positives bans pls fix R* edit i contacted rockstar support personally over phone and they said nothing about the ban so it looks like even if you phone them they wont do anything to help you 2/10 for support
0;i woldnt suggest this game if you want to play and have fun i got banned twice now havent modded or anything just get banned im not sitting on the second ban i will fight it so if your looking to have fun get this on a consol less likely to get banned in my experince
0;This review is exclusively for GTA Online What the ? Default controls are complete (numpad keys for ing flying) no dedicated servers extremely p2w microtransactions and cheating prevalent with no real anticheat (I just saw a godmode tank spawned in an online session). An absolute ing unfunny joke of an online game.
0;I'm late to the party. Tried to shut down OpenIV? Entitled much?Leech from the modding community for years and then try to shut them down?You greedy pieces of trash...You're gonna have to pull off something really spectacular to get the peoples support back.Update Now you're giving badges to people for writing a good review? That IS spectacular spectacularly dishonest.
0;This Game is fun and everything. BUT the servers are ing awfull i was in a very hard heist and all of a sudden one of my friends games went to another session and we lost WTF ROCKSTAR 2.3 BILLION GROSS REVENUE AND YOU CAN'T FIX THE GODDAMN SERVERS WTF!!!
0;It is actually imposible to have fun and make money in this game anymore! I mean it is but only after you have spend around 20 and more mil on stuff so that hopefuly after 100 more hours of gameplay you may or may not get a profit. Other than that the game is great and if you enjoy grinding or don't mind it OR are in just for the singleplayer it is a must buy.
0;Great game if you like driving. Terrible game if you like communication. Noone talks ingame noone has mics. The only communication is in the text chat.Also there is a hacker every game now which makes it unplayable if you call him out as he literally just crashes your game by spawning planes near you.
0;Threatens OpenIV online with modders everywhere and if u dont buy shark cards u cant afford anything and the last thing is this game has so many bugs support bots bots bots can even help i can launch this game because it asks for the activation code again after 550 hours played and when i enter it again its already in use ty ty ty hehahahahahah im so happy thanks!
0;Ok now i played this on PS3 decided to get it for fun on PC but the amount of lags is just unbelievable....I would not recommend getting this game now always crashes on highest settings even though my PC is more then powerfull enough Half of the time when you change graphics settings and the game restars all the setting are like they where before you changed them ..... i regret buying it for pc at least at the moment it's really BAD
0;Somebody can take new heli for 4 000 000 and ruin your game experience. And know what? If you on mission on this moment you just cant run away because you cant go passive mode on mission. Every respawn you be eleminated and all what you got is change server f*ck up your mission and progress or you got a*al penet*ation NICE ROCKSTARSorry for my bad english
0;really fun game but I just feel like the only way to proceed is either grinding for countless hours paying your years savings for a miserable amount of cash or getting money from a hacker... please fix this issue that is slowly making your game horrible.
0;An incredible game. People will be talking about this for generations. Unfortunately the largely popular online mode is completely ruined by furious hackers (which I assume reside in their parent's basement) wrecking any fun you can have in a public lobby. There's no way gaming giant Rockstar can't do anything about it so that's a bummer. Just buy Super Mario Bros. 2 everybody.
0;Single Player is great but the online portion has gone TOO FAR. Expensive everything! Shark cards pushed! (micro transactions in a full price game!!). 3 FECKING SINGLE PLAYER DLC'S CANCELLED WTF!!!!!!!!!!! The GTA 4 dlc was so good.Rockstar listen the hell up.
0;i changed my review ! you removed the sp modding ! i spent 4 months of everyday work putting my mods in game so i can enjoy it !now when im not in the mood of tryharding so i can make some money online i have to play the non updated story mode ! AND TRUST ME IF YOU PUT A GOOD STORY MODE DLC WE WILL PAY FOR THAT!
0;entirely pay to win game. Rockstar keeps releasing updates that cost more and more money and unless you buy shark cards or hack in your money then you cant use the content of half the game. Rockstar is money lead and money greedy. rockstar https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;I now would not reccomend this game purely because Rock* are a bunch of A** for brains purple d*** F*** trumpet playing canoe riding c*** biscuits. I WANT MY DAMN MENYOO BACK!(I have teir storage space I had deleted the game so I could install another thing. This fuggin sucks elephant testicles.Edit I HAVE MY FLYING BICYCLE BACK! WOOOOOOO!!!1!11! In all seriousness somehow the internet one. I still do not recomend the game because it is the grindy est game that I play besides Warframe.
0;"""P2W game either that or you wait for some hacker to give you millions just make sure you spend it ALL and don't even bother selling cargo from your organizations because a week or so later R* will take all your money legit earned or not. So if you are given money from a hacker spend it. All of it. Then when R* """"adjusts"""" your balance you may return to normal business. Until a hacker comes again..."""
0;My review was positive but now its negative. Not only is Take two a company with all of this cease and decisting OpenIV but the online portion is a P2W fiasco. I've been kicked from GTA 5 online sessions from doing absolutly nothing and just being in my apartment. This once got me placed into the bad players pool. I then tried to contact Rockstar and explain but they ignored me. This is why i not only hate Take two but also Rockstar.
0;was a great game up until the latest update. gunrunning sounded cool but was way to overpowered. whoever spends the most money wins. people who dont have all the gunrunning stuff cannot even fight back. after this update i uninstalled the game and will not reinstail it unless something changes.
0;After only getting 200 hrs on this game I was banned first time for playing with a modder and getting money from him. after that it was because of the Singleplayer mods I had in the game folder and Finally it was just because Rockstar is an So you rockstar and this game.
0;1600 hrs of game play gone..... LVL 325 earned gone....... 200$ original shark card purchase gone......... Suspension till April 23 2018 and reset of character to 0. Never had a mod menu Im 40 too old for that stuff. I was violated many times by modders but never cheated myself. Now I feel like I was betrayed and robbed by a corporation that can do what ever the heck it wants..... With no explanation just fine print.....
0;This was a really fun game once. Vehicles are increasingly OP so good luck running any of the new missions. Not that they give enough money for the new items brought in. Rockstar has turned this game into their personal ATM. They even laugh at people who buy Shark Cards.
0;This game should be called loading screen online cause thats all this game ever does is load get kicked from a match load disconnect load everything is just loading in this game and by the time you get to game you hate so much you just want to kill yourself.
0;Cutting mod support for offline mode?Well you Take Two you're just pushing people into spending more money on exclusive online that shouldn't even be locked to online only. Not to mention that OpenIV has nothing to do with all of the cheating crap that's going on in Online.Don't buy this (just pirate it tbh) not until T2 gets their together and reverse this ing Cease &amp Desist t.
0;I used to love this game until they raised the costs of everything online and decreased the rewards to the point you actually lose money doing missions...It was already extremely grindy before now its just unplayable online..Im glad I got most of my stuff before the changes.Not to mention for a lot of us vets like myself who logged in recently years later all of our money disappeared. I had somewhere between 10 20m. I login and only had 69k..................
0;This game would be so ing amazing online if Rockstar actullay gave a about their community. I can't play this game for more then thirty minutes before some boy comes up in a jet that will not die or teleports in front of me. GET THESE ERS OUT OF HERE ROCKSTAR!
0;Take Two has really shot themselves in the knee here with the whole Open IV situation. This... this is not okay! As much as it pains me to give this game a negative review we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;Buy Shark Cash CardsCash is king in this town. Solve your money problem and help get what you want across Los Santos and Blaine County with the occasional purchase of cash packs for Grand Theft Auto Online. All purchased cash is automatically deposited into your character s bank account. Spend wisely cash therapy is fleeting. Grand Theft Auto V required to play and sold separately.
0;Most of my hours spent playing GTA are spent on fu**ing loading the game. I would give this game a 10/10 only if the loading was faster.EDIT NOW GAME WONT EVEN LAUNCH INTO ONLINE LAUNCHING TAKES SO LONG AND HAS SO MUCH MOUSE LAG!!!(I have great specs no SSD tho) Rating 3/10
0;This game is completely since i got W10 the mouse pointer/aim is totally lagged it doesn't saves my configurations (everytime I run the game i had to get it into Fullscreen and change the graphics all over and over again) some changes I can't apply because the game asks for a restart and the configurations get reseted... I really don't reccomend this ing
0;Yes GTA Online was perfect during its first year of release but now it is a complete mess/scheme to urge the players to spend more money on the shark cards what a shameyou can't buy the new features (such as bunkers) and vehicles without grinding or buy the damn shark cardsRIP GTA Online 2015 2016
0;Could have been a great role playing online game but you can know anytime where are the other players motorcycle clubs are pretty bad because two clubs can't do missions at the same time. Players are mostly shooting anyone on sight and you just CAN'T hide and will respawn 2 meters from where you died. I m too tired to speak about the other optimisation issues and the money lust of rockstar. If you want to buy the game wait until it is below 20 dollars.
0;singleplayer was fun moddings a pain for it when i started playing online it was ok at first but went to hell after the gunnruning update because they stole my money like most people and now as of 1/24/18 i have been banned just dont play it unles u are just getting it to get baned
0;I loved modding on GTA V. Now Take Two Entertainment you have taken away the abilty to install tens of thousands of them. Next thing I know you will release paid mods that don't even work in singleplayer. You will never be getting a dime from me again.
0;Do you like modding?Do you like getting banned?Then this is the perfect game for you. 2017 update Appears my original review stands. R* doesnt like modders still.Side note Dont ever try to guess your social club password you'll get locked out and have to deal with support. Ive gone through support twice and I still cant reset my password.Dont give these people your money.... until RDR2 comes out for pc.Update Need the badge for nominations
0;First 200hrs were full of loading screensRest of the time is me selling cars to get the ridiculously expensive new car dlc because you cant get any money as a single playerWould have recommended a year ago but its stale and doesn't look like it will be made any better hold off until GTA 6
0;Micro transaction yesFull of modder yesIf you living in around asia and sea (south east asia) most of the time you will meet chinese/korean/japanese but most the time is chinese if you hate chinese people and modder dont buy this game or if you have tons a friend playing this game i reccomend it (but the grind the money is kinda hell)
0;Game is got banned for no reason ban got uplifted . spent all my money on a ing car that cant be used in heists cant sell it back And the ing phone ring every 1 2 min in multiplayer with lenster or some other computer bot busllshit. Takes for ever to load get put into a server with 4 people then have to exit game thru task manager else take 6 ewn weeks to close it.
0;Once you get past the many many glitches this game is very fun. I've had to reinstall this ing game numerous times because it breaks in one way or another. It's not worth getting considering all the glithes you will come accross and irritating modders on GTA online. Also everything on GTA online purposly sucks your money away forcing you to buy in game money for real money.
0;Microtransactions are a must in order to enjoy online play in order to buy even half the things in the game would take hundreds or thousands of grinding missions that are repetitive.single player was spectactualr and has a huge amount of contentThe game is ruined due to Take Twos greed with trying to force people to play online focing them to buy their microtransactions to enjoy the game.
0;I don't understand why you would remove a program that is made specifically for singleplayer modding when you said earlier that you fully supported singleplayer modding.Also with those almost indestructable tanks that everyone has playing GTA V is no longer fun when all you do is get killed I would like to not be in passive mode or go ghosted to people after I have to walk to get my car that they then blow up. ing discusting R* nice job.
0;ruined when they made it so hackers cant give you rediculos amounts of money. the ingame ways are horribly grindy and pay you barely anything for the amount of work put in now its back to grinding long hours to get a new plane or something that you arent even sure if youll like
0;This game is the most annoying ing game I've ever played the npc drivers have the intelligence of a ing brick and go out of their way to hit you at the worst times the enemy npcs have aimbot and can kill you in two shots with a pistol from a mile away it seems like everything in the game is pitted against you to make it unfair just so those shark cards seem more appealing to buy
0;"""The single player is fun engaging and has great mods. If it goes on sale it is a must buy for the SP. As for GTA Online Rockstars buisness practices especially with the introduction of a 40 dollar """"shortcut"""" pack really makes me angry and the game gets increasingly pay2win ESPECIALLY for new players with every DLC. Please under no circumstances shuold you support GTA online or Rockstars greed."""
0;Used to love GTA 5 but with the onset of the clear greed and shark card drive its become a show and more so with the fact that rockstar cant do about the rampant modding and cheating in GTA Online on PC. So much so that innocent people get banned too.
0;TY ROCKSTAR I LOVED THIS GAME FIRST TIME I PLAY THIS GAME ON PS 3 2013 AND I GOT 236 LVL ON ONLINE AND I PLAY THIS GAME IN NEXT GEN PS 4 AND NOW I PLAY ON PC GOT 48 WIHT NEW CHAR ONLINE ON PC SO FUNNY THIS GAME CANT MAKE ME BORING AND NOW ON THE PC I GOT MISISNG TEXTURE MY SPEC IS MORE THEN UR MINIMUM I CAN PLAY BERY HIGH SETTING ON 1080P BUT NOW SOMETIMES I GOT MISSING TEXTURE
0;This game used to be great and if you want to play the singleplayer than do that but at this point don't get invested in online unless you are willing to spend your life savings just to get everything in the game without spending literal months of your life grinding. I just tried to get back into it and was severly dissapointed that Rockstar has not learned from the feedback the players have given for the past 2 years. Sadly cannot recommend this game anymore.
0;"""You might like this game if you enjoy working for months on end to achieve a goal only to be stripped of all gains because a company isn't making enough money from their pay to play / """"microtransactions"""".This has happened to me twice. RIP Rockstar"""
0;Had a full medium sized warehouse. Went to sell it and got the Titan one. As my pilot was taking off over water ducking and dodging Rockstar's signature lag enhanced police I lagged out and could only watch as my investment dropped helplessly into the Pacific Ocean. Do not give Rockstar a dime they're worthless as a dev and obviously could not handle a venture this big. Server errors script kids and trolls are all that await you if you get this money sink.
0;Gameplay 9/10Story 10/10Environment 10/10Developer 10/10 (for removing mods)I'm a GTA gamer since Grand Theft Auto 3. GTA V is good game but developer filtered too much. Removing excitement of other players. They removed the mods but they can't remove all cheaters. They put on 60% on sale to cover all negative feedbacks and keep the game on trending.I'm not a modder btw. And pls R* pls fix the always error signin directly to online and always stuck at loading screen!
0;so i got turned into an xmas tree by a hacker today ..... maybe wana do something about the hackers and bugs there rockstar .... new content is great but only if the old content isnt still broken like this ... friends gettn cash stolen from by hackers me gettn turned into a tree and all the countless server errors booting ppl that are playing with me from the lobby so they hafto re join ... just fix it or im done here il go back to my overwatch and mech warrior.
0;They want to stop cheating and mods fine. But someone gave me some money via hacking the game I had a toltal of about 25 million dollars about 10 million I had earned on my own and paid for with shark cards. They did their clean up leaving me with about $200 000. I'm done with this game.
0;The GTA V is good as story and climate of game BUT all the glitches 0 optimalisation of graphic for pcs and AWFUL online full of hackers and kids annoying you meanwhile you tring do your stuff... for not saying about leak of any logic in unlocking the weapons by the level so someone being level 100 can kill you easy with minigun or better sniper rather than you using basic weapons... for a game that is still 25 I prefer spending it in sait row series... Rockstar SHAME ON YOU
0;Thought come back played about 15 hours over the weekend and today I thought oh sell my vigiliante so I might have enough get one of those new nightclubs. Well no some hacker when i put my villagente in the Mobile command center blow me up along with the car. So when i rang up mors mutal insurance.... my car isnt there I then checked my mobile command center its not there.... Go to write a support ticket to rockstar there caption thing doesnt even work. So it and FU** YOU rockstar.
0;Absolute garbage Rockstar banned my pc account Every lobby i join some modder is messing with the game eg teleporting me freezing me locking me in a cage.Joined a lobby and some guy jumps in my car and adds upgrades to itnext thing i get a email saying my account is banned from online.Emailed rockstar and they basicly said tuff.Do not buy this game if theres a modder in your lobby you will get banned.
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME rockstar does absolutely nothing to stop cheater in GTA Online. You can't play one hour straight without running into one of these s. you'd think rockstar would do something about it since these modder add money into the game which cuts away from the sharkcard proffit but no rockstar has no cheat detection system it looks neither takes reports seriously. Until rockstar bans these and establishes an anti cheat system don't waste your money.
0;not only does it take me 15 mins to get into onlineafter i get into online i get killed over and over again and over again so i go into passive mode and then a modder kicks me from the game 10/10about a quarter of my time on this game is in loading screens
0;oh look a modder omg another and another man the anti cheat suck whats that there is none welp but really the game is fun but untill the stop baning people for no point and start to ban the hacker it would be a good game i hoped on today and counted over 5 modders in my lobby i left to a new one 8 modders now i know why i quit
0;Single player? Awesome!Online? Garbage.Most of the time it takes 5 min to load a 10 min mission That is if you can connect to a online session which is nearly impossible in itself.Rockstar get your head out of your and fix this Junk. oh and did i mention hackers galore? I don't need you you can see for yourself.Also Customer service is a joke. They use the same handle when replying to my email but its like i get a new person every time.
0;great game unfortunatly lost my intrest when they stopped openiv which means its unmoddable otherwise vanilla gt just straight up sucks 0/10 will not be buying the next gta game unless modding is reopened so modding has been reopened but i will not change my review sadly boring predicatable and money grabbing
0;My review for GTA 5 was positive once but now I cannot recommend this game to anyone especially when they are still asking full price on a game that came out before some kids even entered kindergarten. The singleplayer may be amazing but it is not worth $60 and the online is a heaping pile of garbage that makes Ajit Pai look apealing because of the sheer audacity of what things cost and the high amount of cheats. Avoid this game at all costs.
0;The game itself is ing solid hell its ing GTA it's always a good ing time. But I can't say the same for the company. If you don't have an internet connection you're ED even for ing single player! What is this Sim City? And even when it's on they can't get their together and let me play single player cause I can't connect to a server. Also the ing modding problem. I've met SO many hackers online and yet they just ban people for single player mods. Good job Rockstar you ed another PC release.
0;Banned OpenIV basically made modding illegal? One of the main reasons I bought the PC version was so I could mod on offline not because I needed another copy (I have it on last gen next gen and PC) The purchase of this on PC was purely due to the beautiful modding community from GTA IV intrigued me and it was the same for GTA V for a long time until now Dislike.
0;"""This is a REALLY good game but thanks to rockstar social club i can't EVER login/play this game ever again not even offline (""""This Steam account is already linked to a different Social Club account"""") I tried every E mail i have and none worked It would be nice if someone could help.I have tried everything and nothing workedI paid for this game and i want to play it"""
0;Rockstar cares too much about making money from shark cards for online i used to buy them when i got a decent amount of items for them but lately prices on new items are sky high to the point where each update requires 4 5 of the 100$ shark cards to buy everything.
0;Oh sorry that you need more money from your players who just want to play a decent game and not be milked by a greedy corporation. Taking away openforge will prove to be a mistake.P.S if you touch Kerbal Space Program you're going to fall into Ubisoft levels of public dislike.
0;this game was great fun when it came out. the single player was great. then their online mode came out and they began overcharging for everything because they have microtransactions. they want all of your money.and now? Take 2 are cease and desisting one of the main backbone mods for the game basically killing off the majority of its modding scene. this is disgusting.not worth your money or time now.
0;F*ck this socialclub nonsense i bought it on steam and can't play the game with my steam account are you kidding me? seems like Rockstar needs to get on the same boycott list ubisoft and ea are already on.the game is great tho would like to try out the new red dead redemption but i guess i won't.
0;"""I really enjoyed this game way back at the start but the game was ruined by the online mode being the main focus of the developers who use awesome features as not being able to rob cars in a game called """"grand theft auto"""" things that cost more than the game to buy with real world money or selling your soul tho the devil and sharing your account with wayyyy too many people so you can afford things with game money."""
0;this game has no need for reviews but whatever. **edit** this game is being milked for cash to hell and back. This game went from genuinely enjoyable to the entertainment value of two crack addicts fighting in an LA cross country bus station. Just make a new game already god damn.
0;GTA IV and V modding were the best parts of the games and arguably the ONLY reason to buy them since Take Two doesn't care at all about the quality of the game anymore. They literally just want to make more money and getting rid of mods apparently is their idea of making more money. This is terrible and you Take Two for killing off ten years of modding and for trying to kill off modding in general.
0;Don't buy this trash this game is ptw PayToWin i do like the dev team that keep this game alive but the content that comes out will take upwords of like 3 weeks of playing to get some of the ridiculous thing's the bring out .An example of this is last update they bring out jet packs and a hover car. i find this a joke of the game as it brings hackers on the very first day of the update being out to get these ridiculous cars and stuf it turns the game into a mess of pvp and ptw madness.
0;GET R* THE MODERINO BCUZ IT GET BLOCT BY TAKE TO AND IT BAD! IT GET TAKEDOWN AND IT NOT GUD I LOOSE 60 DOLLER CASH TO TAKE 2 AND WE WONT 2 MOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLZ HELP TO FITE LE 2TAKE BECUZ THEY LOOSE GTA PLYERS LOTS OF LE DOLLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY SEY THEY GIV U MOD SUPORT BUT ALL THEY GIV IS UNHAPPEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;The base is alright but i cant give it a recommand because of the practices of take two rockstars parent company. They are attacking mods and not adding features that exist in multiplayer in single player to push people to multiplayer to make them pay for micro transactions.
0;Gta 5 was great game until rockstar games added flying cars cause this is no more Gta this is some futuristic Battlefield game where Online is chaos with modders and because of modders legit players get hurt and get money take away.. I don't like online anymore but storymode was great! I reccommend play FiveM if you people don't like Online and wanna give Gta 5 another chance!
0;steals your ammo glitches and crashes overpriced everything to make you pay more money on a 60$ game banned poeple for players dropping money loading screens ways to make money basically a very expensive is what youll buy it'll give you fun but it'll run out.
0;Don't get this game for the mods Rockstar will you over every single time it updates two updates ago the game wouldnt load the update before this all my mods failed and now my sound wont work. Im getting the feeling Rockstar is ing with its consumers and im enraged because of this. Stop screwing with this game's damn files every update and just add content you ing
0;It's a pretty open world game with lots of chaos and destruction available but I'll be damned if it doesn't become incredibly repetitive incredibly fast. If you're looking for mental masturbation this might be your thing. If you like driving sims this is definitely up your thing.If I could give this game a neutral score I would. It isn't terrible but I certainly don't recommend it.
0;firstly i couldn't play online because of my 'router'...ok then next is now i can't even login to my own social club account 'linked with another steam account'...like what...i bought it with this account and now you are telling me its linked with another account??? btw it is suppose to automatically log me in but this time its stuck and now i don't even know what to do. Thanks rockstar useless feature and support. Wasted my bloody money
0;The story mode of this game is ing amazing but most of you already know that and are probably looking to buy the game to play online with your friends and let me tell you the online is a total . Modders everywhere impossible to make money to buy cars. Only way of getting rich is by playing this game every single day of your life for at least 4 hours or buying shark cards. Rockstar is greedy as and its disgusting. 4/10 on the nigg scale
0;Offline play pretty sure fun to play but online play so much garbageim talking about heistfirst it took 15min to 2 hours just to fill the partysecond if one party member left all your hardwork just perishthird you may end up like me try to finish 1 set up in 3 days only to get leaving by party member many many times after many many hours making the party full
0;Literally unplaybleHonestly I don't think it's possible to say anything worse about a game.I don't mean that in the instagramtard senes of the term either.I mean LITERALLY unplayable.Can't log in. Can't create a new account. no method for recovering previous account.
0;game is alright but over time the grind for money has got crazy to force u to buy shark cards and the amount of hackers in the game is a joke and best part is u will get banned for hackers giving you u dont want so enjoy the show if u buy this because thats what you will get lol other than rockstars every poor service the gameplay is good )
0;This is part of the problem with games being online...You can make a game sell a game and then completely pull the rug out from under your customers in an update like this. Take Two and Rockstar aren't the only one's doing it... but they're the last people I thought would.Youre also just going to get griefed and when you try and do anything back they just jump into passive mode get in a tank then kill you.
0;OpenIV is back yes.HOWEVERRecently the entirety of GTA online has been farming for the $5 000 000 to $6 000 000 planes that arent even good.Modders have incredibly increased with the recent smugglers run update NOT EVEN KIDDINGAround 3/4 lobbys i join there is an obnoxious modder ruining the game.The singleplayer of GTA V is really good but online has become a cesspool of farming modders and fighter jet / apc / minigun trolls.
0;This game was cool. Until there came airbiks and cars that have bazuka. It has taken all the fun out of the game. You really do not want to play it / Rockstar should do so you could choose 2 different types of servers. one where they were allowed and one where they are not. It's really bad style ROCKSTAR!
0;"""My previous review """"Awesome game.. it doesn't get boring after a while..""""Now my review got changed in a HUGE way I just got banned for 1 month for NO SINGLE reason what so ever I've been playing for 2 hours today and after a dropoff at my warehouse I got a ban message!!After being in contact with the support they give an automated reason (looks like copy past from a spreatsheet) and doesn't even react personally to any appeals!"""
0;This game has an amzing single player with great gameplay in multiplayer...if you can connect. I have played 40ish hours of this game and the amount of times that I have been unable to connect is around 30. Would I reccomend the singleplayer? Yes! of course it is amazing. Would I recoment the Online/Multiplayer? If you can connect then go have some fun but otherwise don't bother.
0;This game is fun til you launch online and realize it's just pay to win gargbage filled to the brim with hackers. Each update gets more expensive and forces you to buy shark cards to not get floored by tanks that are in every way shape and form better than whatever you have. this game lol.
0;"""Unable to run the game without crashes before any save points want refund.*edit So played with out an internet connection was able to get to savepoints but game still crashes randomly and its not fun to worry about your mission progress going down the drain when you can't know when the game will crash only suggestions is to """"quicksave"""" before starting missions so you don't have to retravel to start points and thats it."""
0;I have spent over 500+ hours playing this game making money from hiest Ceo missions car races and a few shark cards I have waited for weeks for this Dlc to drop saved tons of money tobuy the new toys I log in and everything i busted my for is gone Stay away from this game Stay away from rockstar they messed up a great game and its t
0;This is t I love gta v as a game and I even bought it on multiple consoles but you know why I bought it on pc? To mod. Not in online but in single player where it should be allowed and one of the biggest modding developers OpenIV were sent a cease and desist letter from TakeTwo. So if you are thinking about buying this game to mod don't waste your time because something that was said would be allowed before the game was released has been taken away from us.
0;log in after 5 years same problems exist.online matchmaking is so slow you could label it 'not working'.so you get the same downloading this game cracked and buying it.exept you lose money buying it...a pity tho since it would be fantastic if online worked properly.
0;My issue isn't really with the game it's more with the customer support. I got banned from online for no reason what so ever and when I tried talking to rockstar about it They basiclly spat in my face. They don't help you what so ever. You can't even unlink your account if you're banned. I hope Rockstars support gets better within the years to come and I hope issues like this wont occur in the next game.
0;ORIGINAL GAME AWESOME JUST NEEDED MORE HIESTS ONLINE VERSION SUCKS WITH ALL HACKS PEOPLE DOING NOT FUN WHEN ALLOWED TO USE HACKS. The new online update is not fun who wants a unrealistic game half TRON LOOKING HALF TRANSFORMERS PFFFFT SAVE YOUR MONEY. GRAND AUTO 6 SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA NOW THAT WOULD BE BAD A_ _
0;I've played this game over the span of 4 years. I've been here since the beginning of this game. It is time that I say that R* or mainly Take Two has hit the final nail in the coffin due to the incident with OpenIV. My overwhelming love and support for this game ends today. Thanks again Take Two.
0;About 95 hours of the 120 ive played ive done trailing missions transported myself from point A to point B. The other 25 hours weren't bad but not nearly good enough to make up for those hours spent doing booring repeditive sh*t. Besides the grinde you have to do to earn money makes cheaters look like messiah. Since buying a new vehicle is the most fun ive had in this game.1/5

0;GTA V a game for the poor Rockstar. Rockstar banned people for using mod menus to have more fun with friends in their game and is actually copying the ideas of the mod menus for example the new car which can drive on water and fly like a jet. The origin of this is actually from the mod menus.#PoorRockstar
0;Every public lobby you join will have a hacker/modder. They can literally teleport you and the entire lobby into the sky and fall to your death not to mention they can spawn any vehicle or NPC. Dont bother getting this game unless you have friends for private lobbies.
0;I used to love Rockstar. I used to love take two. I used to love GTA. But take two has gone too far by restricting mods. Hell they even ditched SP DLC in order to monotize GTAO more. They took a really good game and when it died they beat it like a dead horse and they continue to beat it hoping money will fall out of the dead horse's All you are doing is off your customers. Congratulations on ruining a good game.
0;1 285 hours MAKING MOVIES with MODS in SINGLE PLAYER having the time of my life. ...And now it's all over thanks to Take Two and Rockstar's greed. You digusting greedy humans. Mark my word you just made enemies with everyone. Look around. They're RDR2? AHHAHAHa. Not anymore morons. Hell no. I'll never forgive this. ...1 285 hours. UPDATE Take Two is now trying to sue and destroy the life of the devloper of Menyoo. I use Menyoo the most. Idiots.
0;Very nice game but Rockstar doesnt care about modders or hackers anymore so it became boring fast bcuz some1 takes your stuff and so all the time and spawns above u so u cannot move or make u unable to move after making you to something like a rock. Please notify rockstar!
0;3 years later it continues to have issues. Between hackers absurdly long loading times and new content so far out of the reach of anybody who doesn't play this game religiously/willing to shell out for in game currency I can only reccomend even booting this game up to get an occasional lump sum that Rockstar throws at the players.Singleplayer is great if you haven't played it.
0;"""fix this ing game full of hackers """" oh we have an anti cheat system """" the anti cheat system consists of a literal 3 foot wall you could walk around or climb over and boom hacked if you want to play a game full of hackers then this is the one for you! if you want to enjoy a game dont bother buying this."""
0;Rockstar dont look at modders or get banned don t accept anything from modders or be banned.Don t buy add on packs it s a waste of money because it s a huge waste it will not give you an advantage it will just make you have to prep everything most lobby s will just make you lose money not make any.Seen cases where rockstar banned legit players because a modder gave them money yet the modders wasn t banned the system is pathetic
0;"""Why do you this to me?""""Online premuim edition""""This game has become more pay 2 win than any other game out there!Just please dont buy that crappy bundle i mean i got everything for free in that bundle for only 15$ (on sale) because i actually played the game!Just stick to singleplayer with mods instead of going online to get rekt by the pay 2 wins!"""
0;I got banned permanently after doing exactly nothing? Rockstar fix this ing system of yours. Everyone who cheats gets away with no punishment everyone who tries to play the Online legit gets permanently banned straight away? Idiots.Singleplayer however is so good (y)
0;If you just want to play the story mode maybe find it on sale for $1. Online is hot garbage and just decides it never wants to work or constantly drop you out of sessions with friends. Everything is also pay to play for all the add ons since earning money is a trickle and they try to force you to get Shark Cards. I havent bought any Shark cards thus I have not done any of the added modes/dlc/missions. These have been long lingering issues for this game.
0;Fantastic PC port incredibly fun game absolutely horrible company behind it. Because of Take Two's business practices and their ceaseless greed I cannot recommend this game to any of my friends. I've had 116 hours of fun but they've ruined any positive thought I had about them.
0;"""WOW... Got Ban For absolutely Nothing.I've never Mods... I always detested Those Mods..I was those who taught mods were bad for the game experience...AND I GOT BAN FOR 30 DAYS WITH A RESET ! I WAS OVER 400. NEVER AGAIN' I WILL NEVER SPEND ONE DOLLAR ON A ROCKSTAR GAMES""""NEVER AGAIN !!!"""
0;As someone who supports modding this is quite an idiotic move for Take two to make also if your a fan of KSP guess who just bought out the company? One of PC gaming's strongest feature is modding dont let the corprote puch you over sign the petition on behalf of all gamers.
0;ing garbage. Game is completely infected with modders. They freeze you prevent you from playing and never unfreeze you. They blow up your cars and one modder blew up everyone in the server and made it look like i did it. These ing s are incredibly annoying and it blows my mind as to why they don't get banned. Another modder flew me in the sky and wouldn't let me down. There has been too many times where I try to play and encounter a modder. They are everywhere.
0;Story mode? It's pretty good.Online? Don't even fuc king bother. It's the thing Rockstar focuses on most and they can't even do it right. Networking issues are frequent cheaters are rampant gamemodes are desolate and content keeps dropping in quality every update.
0;After taking a break for 1 year the game's online community is as cancerous as ever. The only reason one might want to buy this game is just for the singleplayer but since i already did it back on ps3 this game might just be worhtless. I will never buy a new Rockstar product again.
0;Generally a good game but loading times online are way too long!!And Online unplayable because cheater/modders on nearly every server and R* doesn't do anything about it....Offline Great story side quests very good.Online Wait ages to join a server on which some cheater kills everyone with explosions. At least sometimes the explosions also contain confetti.
0;online used to be fun but the modders now run riot in every session i have been in recently.the mod menus seemto be getting more powerful and rockstar seem unwilling to do anythingin case it stems the flow of sharkcard money cannot recomend this product to anyone of sound mind.sorry to be so negative but i hope your experience is better than mine if you have just paid for thiscrap.
0;no one got banned among my friendsoptimization better than years ago i first saw it even can run smoothly (60fps) at high quality effect on my i5+860M laptop let alone my desktopBUT connection to sever is not good at allAND Modder &amp Cheater distoried this gamemission should start as Payday2 it will be awesome otherwise if one of teammates disconnected it will ruin all effort u have doneEdited 6th Jan.Got banned for no reason so I changed my opinion
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Rockstar's anti cheating system has freaked out and banned multitudes of players for no apparent reason and the company refuses to address the issue. They are not supporting their loyal player base who have made their game an smash success. They are not worth your time nor are they worth your money. Look elsewhere.
0;"""Good game from start but turn bad game from now. Too many modder cash this can cause your ban or you play clean you need alot of grinding for money!Not being BAN from 24 Mar 2018 """"event"""" but from now face the spinbot in csgo matchmaking better than play Gta5 face full lobby hacker and got innocent BAN from rockstar."""
0;The customer support is so bad the company cheat customers by banning legit accounts for nothing and the online security doesn't stop modders from manipulating the online game and be careful at any time you can get banned and lose all your money progress or any shark card you have bought. Advice don't buy games from Rockstart.
0;Had my GTA online reset months ago beacuase of a modder. Now I'm banned permanently because of a Rockstar error. Not good. I'm selling all Take Two interactive stock. I think they want to force people to buy a new game with these dirty tactics DO NOT BUY!! ESPECIALLY A SECOND COPY!!
0;Got banned in GTA Online for no reason. After logging in today after not playing for a few months suddenly got banned. No reason nothing and even my account got reset. 2xx+ hours spend on Online on PC all gone to waste. I never felt so cheated before and now i am being betrayed. This is BS!!!
0;Crashes at startup... and while I am sure this is going to be an awesome game it sucks to be part of the Beta+ rollout while paying the full retail price. Till a patch is issued I will live vicariously through the many others on here who are in GTA V heaven )
0;Teleport/lag simulator 2015 now with Aircrafts constantly ramming towers in a store near you!Also too much water88/10 it was ok.Would not recommend until they step up their game and fix the controls for the aircrafts or at least a setting to disable the awful auto hover.
0;It is a good game but there are toooo many modders and when you try to sell some cocain and you see a guy in a chopper that is after you and blows you up but not the cargo and when you try to blow up that chopper or kill that man... NO MATTER HOW MANY ROCKETS OR BULLETS you shot he does not die. you know its a broken game when that happens.....
0;"""I have spent almost 300hrs and over $100 in the game. I have no reason to mod/cheat and i was false temp banned for modding I go on to gta yesterday after my 1 month ban was over and the day after im perma banned. Fix you game pls I dont want to have to spend more money on this """"game""""."""
0;Buy only for the story when it's on sale. But better buy saints row franchise for rockstars milking business.Online loading speeds are worst. Sometimes you can wait 20min because rockstars cloud servers are too slow.Also you cant kick or ban cheaters and they are on most deathmatches. I think I'm starting to understand why they cheat because of LOADING SCREEN TIMES! Also daily objectives are glitched for several years now... so dont do them.
0;don't get me wrong single player is good. however with the fact that this game has the same exact price that it had since its release alongside the fact that online is a hellish facade of hackers and cars that you will never be able to afford (without shark cards) i cannot recommend this game. i would go as far as saying that grand theft auto iv would be a better game at this point in time even though that game is horrifically scarred by the curse of windows live.
0;Its one of my favorite games that is until almost every lobby you join is filled with hackers that teleport to you and then blow up the whole map. Or cause you to get a ban because they decided to drop a billion on everyone in the servers head. GG rockstar ban the non hackers but not the actual hackers. good job.
0;why do you have to block the mods rockstar and take 2. this shows that you just want money and do not care about the people. just dissapointing rockstar and take two very dissapointing now your game will suffer by reviews and in the future might be a waste of space
0;When this game first released it was fantastic. Since then they have ruined the game with shark cards and not supporting single player at all. The gta single player experience is what the IP was built upon and is what I personally enjoyed the most. I was able to mod my game to get the content rockstar should have added in the first place. Through greed that have banned the modding tools that allowed me to do so and I am livid.
0;the multiplayer is what grew on me had to force myself to complete the lackluster single player they didnt even try to make a good storyline or good missions or memorable characters. People QQ about the 'hackers everywhere' but its not as bad as people make it out to be. maybe 1/4 lobbies has a noticable modder and they generally keep to themselves and just use it for their own fun. id say only 1/10 modders cause mayhem but are generally quick to leave.
0;This game has become a blatant cash grab. I have lost all of my respect for Rockstar and will never purchase one of their games again as long as they continue this microtransaction infestation of good games. Rockstar is dead to me in the same way EA died long ago. Stop being so damned stupid Rockstar and get your sh*t together.
0;Banned for no reason YES I KNOW its a bug concerning the new Anticheat they used they removed it no accounts been unbanned yet ... thousands banned for nothing and progress reset ... R* If you are working on it at least Post something ... silence wont get you anything but more negative reviews
0;i loved this game. loved. past tense. but what r* is doing lately is unheard of theyre banning legitimate players for no reason whatsoever and meanwhile they do nothing about the cheaters.i changed my rating to negative one in hopes r* will get the message that they need to fix their game asap. WAKE UP R*
0;Loading. There will never be a game I want less than GTA V Online. The loading is fracking atrocious. It's taken up to 10 minutes to load into a single session.Hackers / Modders. There are plenty of them and Rockstar seems not to care about your gameplay experience. Save your money play something else and save 20% of your life from loading screens.
0;Now im got banned as a clean player played around two hours yesterday went offline and a mail comes in with a 30 day ban and character deletion. Two other friends who played with me got banned two and one of them got an permanent ban the other 3 guys who dont play with us yesterday are still free to play. GAME UNINSTALLED THX R*
0;Running on a GTX 550 ti.Looks pretty great no lag till 5 hours straight of gameplay.Aside from that the game is ing perfect.Edit!!! CHANGED RECOMMENDATION FROM YES TO NOThe singleplayer mode has ABSOLUTELY no replay value and the multiplayer is pretty bad and earning money is way too slow for items which are too expensive. Worth the money? Yes. But it's just not worth the expectations I had.EDIT As of the end of July 2015 the graphics somehow look mushy and bad on the same settings? What the ?
0;Horrible mod support and no attention given to expanding on the single player mode. Ever so often there rolls out a huge update for the online mode which I've only played a couple times and have no intention of ever touching again. Online updates are mandatory and cannot be switched off so they keep cluttering up my harddrive. Only purchase if you intend to play online with hackers or offline with no hopes of extra content ever being added.Probably the last Grand Theft Auto game I ever buy.
0;THE CHEATERS ARE A MAJOR PROBLEM! Makes working hard at making money in game bitter when you get blown up by a modder when doing selling missions that hours were spent preparing for. If not for this the game would be great. Why do they not make it impossible/extremely rare for cheating online?! i suggest buy this on sale. I should have read more reviews before buying. My previous experience was with playstation.
0;The that is in gta online is over price as e.g. a yacht that does jack costs 6 mil at the least the only why you will ever get anything in the new dlcs you'll need to buy sharkcards or get a modder oh wait a nice way to make the game refresh again is 1 make a new game 2 a story dlc like lost and the damned 3 or make new heists
0;When you don't have the intention to deliver any singleplayer DLC then don't mess with the modding community!From failed attacks on SP Mods aside this is one of the best Coop MP Games you can play with your friends. Only hindered by it's MTXs design choices of being the masterpiece it derserves to be.
0;WHY DID THEY HAVE TO THIS TO GTA ONLINE THEY MADE ENOUGH MONEY OF THE FIRST DAY SELLS TO PAY THERE EMPLOYEE'S TWICE OVER NAH BUT OF COURCE THEY HAVE TO US OVER ...... LIKE I JUST WANT SOMETHING IN THIS COUNTRY THATS NOT TRYING TO ME OVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;If you enjoy a solid 10/10 single player experience then I recommend GTAV.If you have a scat fetish then I recommend GTA Online because Take Two loves taking massive on the community. If not then I recommend joining one of many custom dedicated servers.
0;"""""""This game is great and if you have it on one of the other consoles its definately worth the change""""this is what i said before it messed upit asks me for a cd key that ive already have put in and when i put it in it says """"this cd key is already in use by another account"""" that account is me!!!"""
0;Singleplayer is fantastic.Multiplayer would be good if it weren't for pay to win trolls modders rich sIf you have an extra 120$ on top of the 60$ this game already costs buy it. You'll need that 120$ to buy shark cards and make multiplayer not be a constant grind. If you dont have 180$ to drop on a game look elsewhere.
0;Great game with awesome add ons. LSPDFR is by far the best add on. Online play is at your own risk. I played for 2 minutes and 49 seconds to which I just ran around and was banned for life by rockstar.. When asked they said all bans are final. Great game to bad the developers suck at customer service. I took all their games off my computer X Box and PS4 save GTA V on my computer since I found a third party server to play on.
0;There really is no way to get what you want in online mode without either buying shark cards grindig heists to oblivion or just praying that you run into a hacker who doesnt actually kill the whole server but gives you milions only to get you banned or the money to be taken away from you. Overall a really bad experinence if you dont have at least two other friends to goof around.
0;EDIT 6/16/2017 TakeTwo.buy this game for the amazing story mode not the onlineonline sucks yo its just not as fun unless you grind like crazy or spend money to get GTA $Story mode is fun and really creative. The mission designs are well thought out and they dont get stale at all.Switching between the three protagonists is more fun than I thought it would be There's a huge map to explore with alot of secrets kinda lacking in interiors but whateverSingle player is a magical time multiplayer is ok
0;Is i am the only one who try to launch the game and it's open the soical club login and then it's closed ? i paid for a game that every update is making more errors until i fix the last problme..Rockstar we paying you money for a video game so take responsbility and fix your game!
0;Used to be good game. Then it got plagued with modders and cheaters. Then Rockstar decided to fix the problem by banning the innocent players. 1314 hours of play time for me no mods and I got permanently banned. Do not buy unless you want to put a lot of time into it then get banned.
0;Look at all the rest of the reviews.There's nothing left for Grand Theft Auto.Hackers modders I was banned and did nothing wrong at all. There was no reason.I didn't even pick up money from the modders.They force you to buy shark cards or hack or grind. The players who grind are banned for nothingThe hackers are still roaming GTA OnlineThere is no support the player base is terrible in every way.Gameplay is good content is fair nothing else good in this game.
0;The campaign is good but the multiplayer sucks and It's killng the game and rockstars reputation. If you want good singleplayer DLC like TLAD or TBOGT and multiplayer that is actually good stop supporting the current multiplayer because rockstar is going to milk the out of it for years to come if they keep making as much money as they are. also GTA 6 multiplayer will be the same.
0;Product received for free. Have to indeed that this game is great but gta online is a bunch of They want you to buy their If not 3 characters will spam their phone to speak to you whether you're answer or not. And yes the most expensive thing ya can afford is a yatch but it aint
0;Faithful player for years without ever using cheats (I don't even use mods for single player). Now banned because some modder in a lobby screwed with the amount of reports on my account and Rockstar does not allow ban appeals. What a big middle finger to players who spent years legitimately building up their character only to have it taken away in minutes.
0;This is a must play for anyone who hasn't played it yet it goes on sale a lot and is one of my favourite games. Singleplayer is amazing. The reason I have a thumbs down is that I have a GTA online character for the PS4 that I have put hundreds of hours into and I can't transer that character to the PC and I am quite mad about this. Also Rockstar get more money hungry as time goes on and they are forcing you to grind for days just to get a decent car wihout paying real money.
0;Mods all over and long load time between sessions. Talk about the online community enhmmm. Hostile with modded players that bought stuff you can't afford with modded money that kills you over and over again. Customer service well don't see how to contact them in game and did they really set up a customer service? Experience? Horrible grind where theres always someone to mess up your bunker/nightclub/motocycle club missions. Yh. Nice game rockstar.
0;I played this game for months and still cant afford to buy anything good So many modders and hackers in game it is a joke. Got money spawned on me and my account is suspended. LMFAO did nothing to get banned or suspended for and i am suspended. Your game is crap Because of the cheaters! I WILL NEVER BUY ONE OF YOUR GAMES AGAIN. YOU ROCKSTAR GAME.
0;Why is playing with your friends disabled until you complete the tutorial? Why do you have to play with random people? (Imagine if you could do the tutorial WITH your friends!)Other issue Why are there so many phone calls? Why would you introduce the equivalent of telemarketers into a computer game
0;The game is incredible The graphics and story are great everything is perfect.But Online is toxic and 50% of players are invincible flying around spraying rockets out their asses10 Hours of grinding will get a midrange car (Yeah im not joking)its like a mobile game every single little thing is them trying to push ing shark cards
0;What a ing joke this game has become. Im so dissapointed in R* how could they up this opportunity to make one the greatest online games ever. But theyve ruined it with so much childish and the whole online revolves around griefing. Why dont you stick to singleplayers R* because its pretty ing apparent thats the only kind of games you can do well...
0;The game is good Gameplay is good everything is fine but the worst part about it i downloaded mods and i played with mods for 1 year after that my game wont load anymore..... its the infinite loading screen. i deleted the mods and still i cant play.Rockstar please disable modding on the game or atleast fix this.... i got scammed 60 euros and i cant play i havent played it in a year.I got it in 2016 played it the whole year until 2017 and then i just couldn't..fix this please!
0;Now that modding has basically removed this game is crap atleast if you bought the other two versions of the game. Only reason I bought it was to mod and because of these money hungry bastards I would like a refund... Rip old Rockstar when you didnt use micro transactions New Rockstar? Burn in hell
0;Rockstar what are you doing with your game!Fairly earned money is disapearing new dlc's are so expensive that you have to do so many missions to affort a new car. The sharkcards are overpriced AF. That new rocket bike is like 4 million wich stands for 0 5 Megaladon sharkcard. That is 37.5 euro for just one vehicle!!! Rockstar is going way to far with this If you want to have fun sure. Buy it but don't play online )
0;Fun game glad they're finally taking a stance against cheater!Edit well that didn't last long. As soon as cheaters screamed they reversed decision and within 2 days lobbies were full of cheaters again. Still a great fun game very well optimized but you basically have to play in solo/friend public lobbies and kick anybody else that joins.Cheaters in every lobby. R*'s last banwave in April left many players with reset stats due to false positives....
0;"""I'm not even going to beat the dead horse that is this game's """"""""""""""""anti cheat"""""""""""""""" or even complain about Rockstar's sleazy money grabbing and constant reviving of this game with ty dlc because the most infuriating part about all this is getting locked out of my own account with no chance of changing the situation. Rockstar and Valve for letting this happen"""
0;If you are solo I recommend only Single Player. Multiplayer not recommended. Too much grind needed and for that you need a 4 players team that should be your friends. Random stable team with communication to do the heists at a normal a pace never ever gonna happen!
0;This was one of my favorite games until hackers started throwing money at everyone which resulted in getting banned. Their automated cheating system doesnt work and they cant weed out cheaters and they fail horrendously in communication. Their customer service is absoultely horrible and no one will help you. They pretty much just want to steal your money right out of your hand and wont do anyhting about it.
0;same old tricks latest patch adds game modes where you have to pay 3 mill for a gun on your car otherwise you're cannon fodder.every time you load up online you get about 10 telemarketing phonecalls over the next 15mins which the game forces you to pick up (martin tony arena person ron ljt lester cia dude and so forth). so you better not rob a store or fly a plane near buildings for a while i call it the roman bellic experience.
0;This game is amazing I would recommend this game to anyone there's so many things to do and there's GTA Online which add even more fun to this game. even the developers are amazing i've had some minor issuse with the game but Rockstar compensated for the issue which was a great thing.7.5/10 Would recommend
0;Product received for free. Its a bad game do not play any team death matches if you are a skilled player me and my friend got banned because some kid was bad and reported us for hacking even tho we are just good at the game rockstar games does have something in common with epic games tho they are both scams and bs
0;starting the game new now is just too much effort you have to first get money then spend it just to stop the constant phone calls but while that's happening you can't actually spend your money on anything that looks cool or sounds nice because you need to level up.TL DR you need to be able to invest time into this game
0;Rockstar instead of crooking players by adding a shark card during sales you could actually be doing something against the hackers that constantly appear and ruin the game YOU MADE. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT FFS. I only recomend this game to people who want to play solo or in a private sessionEDIT It's kinda playable now
0;Totally would have recommended this game BEFORE but after the ILL GOTTEN GAIN'S part 2 update the game is turning or has turned into the PC version of Batman's latest game I used to get a stable 40+ FPS while playing now it can barely go 20 25 and it micro lags too while driving around the city in Story Mode so unless they (Rockstar) issues a HOTFIX for the issue I am giving it a THUMBS DOWN
0;this game is cool but now it says unable connect to rockstar server WTF??i tried restart router i tried add non steam game i tried a few more method shared by other user that facing the same issue not working! please if u got any other way pls tell me appreciate it
0;good game awful bugs and the devs dont do anything about it. Crashes at times in startup wont connect to online massive frame drops freezes when you try to close the game its terrible. Right now im trying to play and it signs into social club and then signs itself right back out.
0;After years and years of playing this I still have so much to do in this game and so much people to meet even if it looks like I already did every thing possible and my friend list counts hundreds of players to hang out with )upd Well rockstar ruined game after last few updates and its just... Not fun anymore. Don't even want to waste words for this.
0;They won't fix glitches or bugs. Get's old drawing hands just because you're on controller nevermind all the other t. You'd think they would fix something that basic but they can just gloss over it like the oppressor glitch which makes it the fastest vehicle in the game. Should call it glitches online because that's also how you make any money.
0;"""DONT BUYThe developers and creators of this game are probably the most greedy people who ever set foot on this earth.I dont know why they call ingame purchases """"micro transactions"""" there is nothing """"micro"""" about them. DONT BUY THIS GAME . GRAND THEFT (YOUR MONEY)"""
0;Credit where credit is due GTA 5 is a good game. But Rockstar is so stupidly greedy to where they make everything in the game overpriced to the point you have to buy overpriced and underrated shark cards or find a modder to give you money or become a modder. Rockstar fix your junk.
0;NEW EDIT Holy f*ck this game is sh*tty. The endless load times and the buggy systems ruin it. If you wanna play with friends be prepared to load for 1 hour back and forth between sessions for like 10 minutes of play time.I can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game of all time. On the PS3 i've spent over 500 hours in it and i'm gonna spend even more on PC when it's been upgraded so much.Definitely recommend this.
0;More than 2 years since i first reviewed it had it uninstalled for most of that time. Decided to give it another go now and the multiplayer is as bad as it was... The game itself is great but the comunity is realy bad and you can berely go around 5 mins without someone exploiting or hacking something. And since this long has past and nothing has been done about it. i cant realy recomend this to anyone.
0;While installing don't put away your credit card. You're not done paying yet.Despite the price being 20 all the time you will have to pay more if you don't want to get f'd by everyone who has paid for everything.This game is the definition of p2w.500 000$/6 000 000$ would not buy again.
0;I'm only interested in single player which used to be very nice. Mandated I need this Social Club account nonsense. I don't like this one bit but OK. Now suddenly I cannot log in anymore or something. Long story short the last straw passed a long time ago... And now I cannot even start the game because of this! Rockstart and Steam I had no need to pirate games for years. Pirating was never about the money... Steam was just more convenient. That has now changed.
0;"""Should be renamed to Grand Theft Auto Loading Screens great game but each time I tell myself """"oh why did I stop playing this awesome game?"""" and then proceed to launch it immediately I see why loading screen before launching the game loading screen before loading a mission loading screen after a mission between missions and hell they can even take up to 5 minutes each time.Great game otherwise i would've spend hours on it if it weren't for these obnoxious waiting times."""
0;GTA is GTA. It has amazing graphics great missions fun items and an amazing amount of content to play with. BUT ever since a few updates it has gotten out of hand. Prices for the new DLC content are reaching the millions and nothing is getting cheaper. Even worst the new missions cannot be done unless you have a minimum of 2 000 000 to spend.UPDATE NOV 2018 Permenantly Banned go to hell Rockstar. You just lost a client.
0;Only good thing about this game is the singleplayer. Mp still has hackers and still has pay to win. I'd rather the DLC cost money than deal with people who dump hundreds into in game cash to buy gear. I refuse to spend more of my money to be able to actually enjoy the new trash.
0;"""There's really no point in playing anymore especially online.New missions events and content fairly often!! YAY!!! RIGHT?!? yay?...No because the moment you log on you're in a cage bent over blown up or otherwise """"hilariously"""" griefed.The game is ruined and **ckstar doesn't seem to care.Pure Cancer."""
0;Got suspended and received a notice saying that my character will get reset once I'm able to log back in. I legit have like 30k a biker clubhouse 3 cheap properties and a few cars. I don't know what I did to receive a suspension. Rockstar seems to fail at doing player background checks I've stuck around this game since 2014 and never hacked nor was hacked ever since. This is t
0;Online filled with cheaters that can even de rank you very long loading screens that are server dependent getting stuck before loading screens and having to alt+f4 never ending 'joining' status on players in lobby and no timeout or ability to kick themThe netcode is so bad that hackers can kill you while playing singleplayerhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v GL11jHKhOLo
0;The game was fun until the banned mods completely then it got stale. Otherwise doing heist with friends was fun. Just driving around and killing the same players over and over was fun. Before they banned mods moders would come into lobbys and through parties at airfeild and things would get pretty crazy but now its just boring.
0;Today Rockstar Games and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and it's all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo.
0;Now after many many hours on the Xbox 360 &gt PS4 &gt PC this game turns into quite the money pit. The main story is amazing just like any rockstar game but the online is awful. Unless you have money burning a hole in your pocket this game gets boring once you've done the story.
0;Product received for free. Game is garbage and crashes most times now. Modders in every lobby. Like the USA they took something good and ruined it. REAL LOW LIFE KIDS ARE THERE TO GREET YOU. Complete waste of money. There is no redemption in R* games or the trash they breed.
0;I no longer care for the game. I hate even turning it on just to have problems with loading in or server crashes. If you can get in the game and it plays fine you have to deal with modders and trolls. All i want to do is play the damn game not deal with the other people. Then if u want to play with ur friends you have find a server with room. Even if you've been playing with them u can get slit out in missions or in different servers.
0;You can now get hacked on Single player.Online income is throttled down to the point that you would have to buy ingame money with real money to be competetive with the cool OP vehicules.They could spend more time making RDR2 for pc instead of this shananigans. but its making them more money than create SP DLC s like GTA 4 because gullable kids with mummy credit card keep throwing cash at their faces.
0;Pros+Graphics is pleased to eyes.+The storyline is quite fascinating.+Online mode is very entertaining.Cons cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters Opressor MK2 ruined free roam balance cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters cheaters
0;the online for newcomers is horrific. There is a lot of high level modders and cheaters that will go out of there way to stop you from making money. they will chase you around in flying bikes anf cars that fire homing rockets that will kill you in one hit on missions .
0;pay2play or grind boring missions infinity loading and you can find players only for new missions 2x exp 2x money. Full servers lagging af unplayable. A lot of bugs never fixed. I never played more than 2 hours without critical gamebraking bug mostly infinity loading or bugged objective
0;Good single player if you plan on Online features though...There is a lot of content and the shark cards they sell equals to nothing to get anything quite a rip off. If you do get to play online i suggest modding and giving yourself 200 300mil should cover all what you need to have a good time don't pay a cent more to the Rockstar they got 60$ up theirs )
0;GTA V Okay game. Play it once and forget it. Too many boring missions. Flat and pointless characters. No challenge. No replay value. Forgettable. GTA Online Good game spoiled by various stuff Oppressor Mark II. Cheaters. Hackers. Modders. Bugs. Disgusting load times. Incessant phone calls from characters. Censored chat. Unfair game mechanics. Unskippable cutscenes. Black screen of death. White screen of death. Loading screen of death. Clouds of death.
0;Full of hackers who kill/fire up/jail/etc everyone and they dont get banned. But if a hacker gives you xp or money and you get banned for 30 days and all your progress is reset. Hours and hours wasted money wasted (bought criminal starter parck).I can't recommend this game.
0;Buy only for the story mode Online full of hackers and spawn campers. Heists unplayable with randoms at most. Pay to win is the way to go in GTA V Online. Only good thing that came out of GTA V was the story mode and private RP Servers such as FIVEM.Overall dont recommend for anyone looking for a solid multiplayer experience that doesnt leave you in a constant grind for cash just to buy facilities that cost more cash to earn abit more.
0;Every second player either uses hacks or joins money lobbys and has ton amount of money. Instead of fixing the game Rockstar is just adding OP vehicles such as oppressor 2. If you enjoy getting bombarded while you play the whole day to buy a simple fast car because it takes 200 hours to get something good then this game is for you.
0;If you are going to buy this for the multiplayer dont. You will not be able to play any of the content without shark cards ($50) every other update because they are all the same buy building that costs 1mil if you want a hut in the docks or 4mil if you want something useful then everything will cost you 4+mil now. Clear to see the devs just dont give a hackers are proof of that.
0;Greate story mode! but the show that Online portion of the game turned to just makes it feel off. Flying cars crazy looking cosmetics and missions that feel out of place for a GTA game. if i wanted crazy i would just play Saints Row. Also the fact that Rockstar just decided to focus on multipayer and ignore story miode is just sad. a lot of players still love a single player expireince. also you Rockstar for not releasing Red Dead Redemprion 2 on PC!
0;If you play online be prepared for modder abuse. Aimbot godmode self explosion everything to you off. They can even crash your game think about it. You know the worst part of it? 3 out of 10 players are using mods(based on personal experience). The point is tons of modders making this game unplayable and obviously Rockstar doesn't care
0;You need 16gbs of RAM if you plan on playing this game for more than an hour modders ruin the experience while killing your fps no anticheat and there are too many modders or people with god mode and the problems of loading and other issues like that still plagues this game. This game is fun with friends but gets boring when you spend so many hours trying to get a single car.
0;"""Best Grand Theft Auto so far. updated 26 Dec 2018 Download is huge +80 Gigs Stockexchange is bugged in offline mode Socialclub is inevitable Socialclub is bugged Support is laughable """"In order to continue submitting a request please sign in or join Social Club.""""Rest in peace GTAV."""
0;LOADING..... LOADING..... LOADING.... Error joining session. Reload into session. Endless Loading. Restart Game. Load into session. I have no fps lets fix settings. Disconnects from game to load new settings. Sit in loading session another 15 minutes. Ran out of time to play games then. off to bed I go.
0;Im a really big fan of the GTA series and i gotta say r* did a great job with this game. &lt This is what I thought when I first got GTA V. I dont believe this game is worth playing anymore. Install FiveM and start playing that instead. Dont spend money on these Stupid Sharkcards. Im ok with grinding but this game is quite ridiculous. A lot of the content is locked behind paywalls so you either grind for literally days or you buy sharkcards
0;Coming from PS3 the game has become much worse the content is overpriced overpowered and most importantly not fun in the slightest. The anti cheat bans for buying shark cards and the community is the most toxic I've seen yet.To think this game used to be good is saddening
0;Orbital cannon. Just for the ing orbital cannon. It's just an extra tool for modders to grief people. Cost me hundreds of thousands from people blowing up my car sales for their amusement and Modders can kill you with them repeatedly with no cooldown. I'm
0;many new content amd DLC And all free! very good conceptI appreciate the attitudeA quick help to the problem with helpfully supportJust only one problem have. Some cheater/hacker/modder noob disgusting players. It ruins the game experience the some cheaters. Please add Anti Cheat System! Until then I do not recommend it to anyone this game!
0;Bought it for the multiplayer that was a ing mistake70% of playtime is loading screens grindy and repetitive gameplay most players suffer from severe mental issues and is impossible to play the heists if you don't have enough friends that don't also have mental disabilities.
0;greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedy.''GTA Online gets laser cannons in a new update'' Yeah they just keep ruining the online experience adding OP weapons and vehicles making this turd of a game look like saints row literally unplayable for people that doesnt wanna buy in game money honestly go fucc yourself rockstar.
0;Single player is good with the usual fun storyline. Personally not such a fan of having 3 characters but it does work.Online though? An absolute trainwreck. Bugs hackers trolls stupidly OP equipment and tons of grinding make it really not very fun and mostly just tedious or outright irritating to play. Rockstar don't seem to have any interesting in sorting out the hacks or bugs and just throw more gimmicks out there.Decided to uninstall as I realised online is not fun it's a frustration.
0;I love this game but god damn does it run like straight for me. I'm running an i7 4790k GTX 1070 8gb DDR3 RAM on windows 10. This game will load up online and run at 60 fps for about 1 minute then skip and hitch into the single digits. I meet the recommended requirments and can say this is not a very optimized game.
0;Bought the game again on Steam after misplacing the physical CD key and the online mode is still full of hackers that strip you of your progress and aid you in getting those delicious perma bans. Single player is your only hope for retaining your sanity but boy is it lonely.
0;The game is grindy to a point in which Rockstar will have Micotranactions to help you buy what you need instead of grinding for **** amount of hours also modders and issues create a really bad online expirence. Get GTA V on sale and get some teammates other wise it's not worth the expirence (or bs).
0;It's a fun game but the worst support you will ever find on a game.I got banned for 20 years yes 20. Because hackers gave me money in a random lobby.So I created a support ticket. Every freaking time I got a automated message saying they can't overturn temp bans...Singleplayer is fun.
0;"""GTA Online Grind Grind Grind......Banned for jumping down a sewer......WTF!!Story Mode (Without Mods) *Plays though whole story without bugs*.......Last mission till ending.....*Bugs Out*...WTF!!Story Mode (With Mods) *Plays LSPDFR then goes online to update openIV*.......""""Take Two Sues OpenIV for using mods on storymode and not online.."""".... WTF!!Edit... OpenIV is back after a month....and online is as always...Storymode well...It's *BETTER*"""
0;Just please make things more affordable in online. I don t want to throw hours away at a time just to buy 1 car. This needs to be fixed. In online it takes far too long to buy 1 thing. Stop charging people for in game currency because it s not worth it at all. When this online system for buying things gets better I ll play a lot more. Pay to win games ruin the gaming industry.
0;I loved this game I really did. Ive spent countless hours grinding getting hassled by griefers tortured by filthy cheaters. But I preservered. But what happens? Rockstar buggers you sideways with the built in robbing mechanic setting you back to square one. YOU ROCKSTAR! I will not be extorted to buy you in game cash!
0;RS should really be glad that I am no longer in the United States otherwise his company will be burn to ash and everyone in this company will be blown up in the hell If you want to know the reason it's there is absolutely no second one on this planet that hates Rockstar more than I do
0;bought for 30 EUR then i want to launch then it says the following steam failed to start game with shared content please update these games first steamworks common redistributablesi play on nvida geforce now but with othergames on steam is does not work too pls tell me how to fix this (note i cant access ANY files cuz i play on nvidia geforce now cuz my pc sux) i only played it for 86 houres with no problems now it sux
0;It used to be really fun but now it's a grindfest and it's only worth playing if your friend uses mods to goof around and stuff these daysIt's starting to feel a lot like a F2PEdit Still love the game for all the fun you can have with friends but I really hate what it's become.
0;I was playing a heist with my friends and we were doing very good. We had lost only about 30k of 1 25mil. We played almost the whole day doing setups for the heist and right as we were at the end of the heist the game decides to kick me out of the server and completely ruin my day. The servers are so unstable that they can't even run themselves properly. Over 7 years of development and this is what we get boys and girls.
0;when you buy the gamethey force the game itself as DLCWHICH it cant be DLC cause its the game itselfthus making the game DLC theres no way for you to return it EVER any game that has DLC bought for it cant be returned so its a auto no return policy then with the random bans its like they just want you to buy the game and not play it weirdest marketing plan i've ever seen then somehow they pull 4bill anyone say money laundering lol
0;Broke Game paid 60 when it first came out deleted it after i beat it redownloaded the 81gbs this wk and i get this?? This Steam account is already linked to a different Social Club account. Please log in with that Social Club account instead. seems to be a huge issue for steam version of gta 5
0;Product received for free. this game has the worst grafics ever like msc traniz 2006 beamng drive and re7 have way better grafics.the story mode is ok but it gould be better and online DONT EVEN PLAY IT JUST PAY TO WIN TYP OF i have played this pos game over 2000 hours and like 50 hours on online and over 2000 in sp i just SAY DONT BUY THIS PEASE OF GAME DONT EVER BUY IT NEVER EVER
0;This game on line is trash every time i log on i lose money over being killed bye other players i can never make money because of other player the only way to play GTA online is to play in a server with only you and your friends or lose money single player story line was grate
0;I still enjoy playing this game... But the DLC's are only for GTA O and is beyond grindy. They try their best to force you to buy shark cards (which are way too overpriced) and to top it off you might get banned for a hacker/modder being in your lobby and you not knowing that interacting with them can land you a ban resetting and erasing EVERYTHING you've worked for.It's still a nice game and I will still play it but Rockstar will never see any more money from me.
0;Can't loggin contact rockstar and they email me telling me the cd key i open on steam is not connected to this account....... with full proof of purchase and me being on steam like the dude.other than this bs its a great game just rockstar really disappoints me with this crap.
0;gta online has 3 peoplehackerman basically teleports around and puts you in a cage then leavesthe 12 year old will skip to hackusations if you kill them once because they dont know what explosive ammunition isHydra/Buzzard boy goes out of his way to fire 2000 missiles into your car doesnt matter if youre on chilliad or in the construction tunnles under the union depository theyll always find a way to ruin your fun.
0;made some dude mad after blowing up his super lame flying bikethe dude got so mad he cussed me out then proceeded to get me locked out of my securoserv stuff over and over again until it kicked me back into the single play campaignlike is this really how bad these hackers can be??? like i kinda want my money back....this hella turned me off from this game
0;While I used to find the game fun and worth the money now days it has become a complete of griefing modding/hacking and many other issues that make the game pointless to play. This has gotten to the point that I can barely leave my garage without instantly getting blown up. Typically when I do manage to leave my garage it is only a matter of time before I am blown up or harmed in some way that involves modding. Rockstar doesn't plan on doing anything to fix this huge issue with their game.
0;The main story or GTA is very lackluster and boring. GTAO is a microtransaction fulled hell hole. You will not be able to afford anything and the gride to get anything is just not worth it. It takes over 70 hours of gameplay to just buy a simple apartments or car. It is so scummy. It just gets worse and worse. Then people mod so much in the game that it is unfair because everyone you want to fight is in god mode.
0;Rewrting this just cause so uh 2015 me was like oh heck yeah GTA online on PC now in 2019 If you are still playing GTA online then uhh rip the grind you should probably go to Warframe in that case I mean the single player is still good and will let you clock in a handfull of hours but otherwise this game was game of the year and still pretty much pay to win
0;this game was great...until i got stuck at the social club loading screen deleted n re downloaded 50+ times watched endless youtube videos and read soooo many help guides forums and still cant play it really hope they come out with a new gta soon because im not goin to buy a console just to play this game..
0;Thank you for constantly updating the game with content and by that screwing over all the SP mods that have to be updated every time you release a ing 60MB update. Thank you for being T2's es and milking money out of players by forcing them to play your GTA Online. Thank you for blocking all the new content from SP. you.
0;I've come to hate this game the story was very good but the online ruined it. Its online mode is riddled with Modders and cheaters. Some of the missions online were fun but they payed out poorly as well. They had high risk high reward occupations but everyone online most of the time preferd to mess you up then help. I get this feeling that rockstar would rather you buy there ingame currency then play the game.
0;MODDERS HACKERS CHEATERS ALL YOUR FU CK ING FAULT AND YOUR FU CK ING PROBLEM TO FIX YOU ARE WORSE THAN THE FU CK ING CHEATERS WHO INFEST YOUR SH IT LIKE BUGS! KIN AND KIND I GUESS FU CK YOU I WILL NEVER BUY YOUR SH IT AGAIN THANKS FOR FU CK ING ME FU CK YOU!!!
0;This game is a ing disgrace. It's been destroyed by the greed of Rockstar and their non existing care for their games player base. Only buy this game for the Story Mode. The online has gone to complete The grind and the amount of hackers and griefers is ridicolus. I don't even recommend this game discounted. Don't buy it unless you have millions in your bank account and for the love of god don't buy the CESP DLC. Also you star!
0;"""""""Steam's 2018 Labor Of Love Winner""""Absolute garbage. The only reason anyone at Rockstar still cares about supporting this title is so they can pimp it out for Shark Cards at an obscene profit.We lambasted EA and Battlefront 2 for their greed how Rockstar has gotten through years of ripping off the consumer unscathed is an indictment on the gaming community.This late in the GTA V life cycle I absolutely DO NOT recommend the title."""
0;Money grubbing game designers don't know the difference between microstransactions for skins and pay to play for people who want a SINGLE PLAYER experience. Stop making your players skill based on how much money you put into the game. I literlaly hate NBA 2k now and I have been a loyal fan since it was on Dreamcast. Get your act together.

0;Do not buy this game! She's only been out for a week and there are already cheaters on it. If you played 2k18 and noticed cheaters..... guess what they all came over to 2k19. What an embarrassment that a $60 AAA title ships AGAIN with no anti cheat. Just one dudes opinion take it for what it's worth
0;"""MAKE SERVERS REGION RESTRICTED! There's so many chineese people taking advantage of de syncing they just skip around the map. EDIT The hackers have infested the game not worth playing anymore. The fact that they have to make a plan to """"fix pubg"""" should prove my point."""
0;reskin version of h1z1 kotk. taking the same path claim to be updating game and make no progress towards it. bring in new crates that require you to buy keys with actual currency but also have in game currency that is basically pointless. all in all win games get crates cant open crates without a key
0;There are many delights with PUBG but also many problems and unfortunately the number of Chinese hackers and Chinese people in general flooding the OC servers ruins the entire game. It is impossible to find a squad where a single person speaks English let alone the entire squad.Add to that the frequent lag and number of glitches and while PUBG can be really fun it can also be entirely frustrating and out of your control.
0;Piece of crap on EU servers since weeks. Heavy rubberbanding during the first minutes of almost every game is really frustrating. These lags teleport you several meters forward and backwards which is incredibly frustrating on early fights. The movement feels very imprecise and unresponsive if you come from CS GO it's a huge downgrade. Then there is a lot of luck involved in the game. RNG aim and circles.
0;Product received for free. This game was really good at launch yes it had its problems just like every other game but they eventually started to fix it then out of no where it took a ing turn down h1z1 road and getting all this pay for skins if im not wrong i thought the creator of pubg left h1z1 because of that sole reason. well here we have it h1z1 renamed and on a different engine. I'm glad i was gifted this game and didnt have to waste my own money on it
0;Not fit for purpose... close up there is no reality i've pumped shotguns uzis assault refiles into people and they take no damage. I don't have a bad setup it's pretty good in fact so I know it's server issues. From distance it's OK but if you're doing well then you'll be close quarters so... not fit for purpose.
0;Can be really fun with friends but on the whole this game is ing trash the lag and rubber banding makes it un playable. They release the game and the test server version is still better. Good Job Blue Balls ya heads. Just adding onto this a few months down the line it is still a bag of dirty carrots 90% of the time no loot after running around like a ing crackhead for 10 minutes looting multiple buildings yet every other will drop down and instantly find some form of AR very anti pukka.
0;Now that the devs have gotten the obstacle of hitting 1.0 out of the way they can now solely focus their resources on more crates! Yay! optimization and fixing the still present issue since beta launch of melted buildings actual item balance and let's actually put this game into the focus of esports a game that relies purely on rng and skill level is only half of what decides a game.Perfect development decisions right here.
0;This game has been a lot of fun to play. I have over 300 hours into it. My community loves it but its no longer fun when every single match there is a hacker. Im not going to play anynmore till its been fixed. When its been resolved ill change my review back to postiive
0;It takes a while for you to get use to this game. I was so bad...but now...i still cant get my chicken dinner! THE AMOUNT OF HACKERS IN UNREAL...please release a anti cheat of some sort so they dont have to go in the files and do modding stuff. I would rate this game a thumbs up if it didn't have all of this crap. Please listen to the community. This game will be so much better
0;devs don't care about their players and only care about money rushing ports to other consoles haphazardly https //www.youtube.com/watch?v MdGBwrJ6rtII remember back when me and most of my friends would play thisnow none of my friends or me play it lolpubg is garbage go play one of the other meme battle royale games instead any of them are better than this trash money grubbing poop
0;Great game Great concept. The only downfall at this certain time is the amount of hackers that are present in the game. So many aimbotters... I will update once they get this fixed but for now I can't give it an upvote for that simple reason. The loads screens are so long and having to wait each time after getting shot through the wall from a hacker each game gets old fast.
0;I would have reviewed a while ago but the servers are too busy please try again later.________________________________________________________You put profitability above playability sacrificed community for consumerism. Your future endeavors will be measured with your choices here and marred by many views.

Game still lags a lot graphical and audio quality is not as good as other Unreal Engine 4 games and the player base has really diminished. If you were to buy this game to play with friends then I would recommend it as long as you pay less than $20.00."""

That isn't the spirit Guys."""
0;Every new joiner will recomand this game but after a while you will begin to hate it not because of the gameplay but because what they are dooing with the game They inserted season pass to a game that was promised to not have any DLC's also they haven't pached the game to find automaticaly the hackers ... 4 out of 6 you will get killed by one of them
0;Now im ready for my review hackers nr one to many number 2 Ping and server lag will kill you love the game but players don't kill me the server is killing me let them fix this and i would 100% recomend this.This is why the server is killing me while im behind the wall im quick tapping my Q or E to look around the corner when i come back boom dead. What is that called server ping 200ms is more than enough to get a girl pregnant. Pull out while you can don't take a chance.
0;I have played this game a lot. It is addictive and has its moments. But all in all DONT BUY it . Servers are almost always down bugs cheaters and STUPID crates if you have the money you can unlock it. This game had a bright future but at the end its all about money. Trust me if you want but dont buy this there are bunch of other games to play.
0;The game makes no sense. Laggy unpredictable broken hitboxes rage inducing gameplay. Skill based? Yeah okay. The only reason anyone is playing this right now is because it's the BR game that has some semblance of gameplay albeit boring after a few hours.Buy it on sale for casual gaming with friends but don't expect anything more.
0;"""Alpha Buggy laggy but expected good game aside from all the issues and an adrenaline pumping end game Release As above but with no improvements beyond saying its """"done"""" and naming the patch 1.0. Servers are practically unplayable due to the massive amounts of lag which is inexcusable after a 10 month """"test"""" phase really."""
0;I very much enjoyed PUBG since I started this game.However this game at its current state is worth around negative 150 dollars. Yes if you get paid $150 to play this game give it a try. I won't bother listing the reasons because I'm pretty sure it's been listed 100000 times.Dev has realized the problems with the game a tad bit too late and it's beyond savable at the current state. If a miracle happens I will change this review in the future.
0;a solid consept with much potential wrapped in bugs bad servers and cheating. and the devs are too busy with squeezing as much money as possible out of it instead of fixing all the enormous issues and criticisms that have been commented by almost everyone that plays it. this contempt for the playerbase should not be awarded do not buy this game.
0;game died when they stopped trading that s how games grow in steam!boring gameplay when players complain fix your server or something money can t fix this you just can t pour money into servers! what do you mean? your buggy as gameplay is trash interface trash if they didn t STOP trade this game would lose that many players in so short time ( this game lost almost 1m concurrent players in 9 months). STOP FIXING YOUR GAME GO JUST COPY OTHER GAMES
0;The base game is fantastic. The user experience is horrible. About 25% 33% of the time I'm dieing to automatic headshots from 200m+. This is their first shot after they have run up a hill or around a corner. These are the same people that track me through hills.Bring on ping limits which will essentially be a region lock.The hacking must be controlled.
0;The devs really do not care about the genral populace they refuse to listen to anything the community says about the game and generally do not focus on making the game good. Pubg Corp. really only cares about making the most money they can before they drop the game completely and that is very evident in the way they handle hackers and D sync.
0;The game is great but there is a major issue Chinese players are leaking over into NA server and most of them cheat...It is really ruining this game because its so awakward seeing someone run 100 miles across a field and when you shoot at them they insta head shot you and there name is like xian142948717839. PLEASE devs ban stop them from joining our servers or else it will end up just like h1z1!!!
0;NOT RECOMENDEDI think these guys always thinking about how to earn more money not a game service or better updates.I've played this game for 300 hours but the update is focus on money weapon skins looting box etc.no optimization so many hackers servers always blow up.
0;Game doesn't even work in Australia any more as the incompetent developers have failed to address the matchmaking problems that have plagued the Oceania servers for months and slowly killed off the community. Don't worry though instead of fixing the servers we'll get some more microtransactions instead.
0;"""This game is complete Garbage buy at your own risk.Launch was a complete dumpster fire the game locks up more now than ever before.The """"new"""" desert map is played almost 4 1 over the original.After buying 3 copies of this game for me and friends I cannot justify it as anything more than a waste of money. Pre Release was fun...."""
0;GAME MAKES ME TILTED EVRYTIME BECAUSE WHEN I JUMP DOWN MY ENEMIES ALWAYS HAVE A ING M4 M16 OR AK AND I HAVE NOTHING OR BASICALLY HAVE A ING PISTOL TO FIGHT THEM. LITERALLY EVRY 1 MIN I HAVE TO PLAY ANOTHER MATCH BECAUSE EVRY MATCH I PLAY IS LIKE THAT!! ING BAD GAME ING TERRIBLE!! E SPORT READY THEY SAID. HA GAME!!Up date Too many people using hacks right now _ hell Blue Hole _
0;"""The game is great but the people that invade this game using hacks ruin it so far there are just too many encounters with hackers. Wish the developers can create a code where every individual that has a strange code with their entry on connection to the server """"person that is using a hacking tool"""" cannot pick up any weapons what so ever. Ands all they can do is be ruined by the game itself and run around like a headless chook!!"""
0;With a safe guess these guys should've made at 45 mills USD in the first two month of sale yet they can't optimize the game for The game looks and on top of that it's riddle with bugs here and there. Go play Fortnite Battle Royal if you want the experience but a polished(relatively) product.
0;HOW HARD IS IT TO BAN THESE CHINESE BOIS THAT ARE H4XORS EVERY SINGLE GAME. GUESS WHAT IF THEIR NAME IS TOTTYT18882999 THEY ARE PROBABLY HACKING. WONT PLAY THIS GAME UNTIL THIS IS FIXED. TO MANY GOSH DARN STUPID STINKY CHINESE H4XORS. THEY STINK!!!!!!!!!
0;DO NOT BUY Early access was acceptable.. too many crashes.. netcode is 1/10. You loose a ton.. then you win one.. then repeat just like a casino. You if you like lighting up a person with 3/4 mag for him to whip around and take you with one shot this game is for you....I guess I'll do one more..
0;Ever since the 1.0 patch my game has crashed at least once a night (results may very). The netcode is a burning dumpster fire. Out of maybe 10 games you will probably have 2 or 3 good ones with the rest being loot sims where you get blasted in the end. The frames I get on medium settings are good never dips below 60fps but I would expect as much out of a 6700k and a 1080ti. When all is said and done I will probably keep playing this game till there is a hole in my monitor. 10/10
0;I don't review many games but felt since this is nothing but a multiplayer I should. The game play is nice and they have made improvements. The issue is with both the cheaters and regional settings. If you're looking to be able to communicate in duo/squad bring your friends. The amount of foreign players on the NA server is insane. 9 times out of 10 you will be matched with players from other regions.
0;Laggy servers with way too many hackers and bikes that randomly throw you off. EVERY THING in this game is just extremly loud Cars bikes the new redzone sounds.At some days this game is just unplayable. Fix your game&lt Unusual movement has been detected from the killer. Therefore the death cam cannot be played.&gt Thanks for nothing
0;"""This is a very fun game don't get me wrong but at it's current state it's actually laughable that they are calling this game """"finished"""". Constant server lag terrible optimization(I can run any game I want on medium ultra settings with my rig but on very low I still have issues with this game. If they would spend more time focusing on actually fixing the issues with this game instead of adding sick new wacky guns maybe I could recommend it but I can't.4/10 It suck a poopoo"""
0;this game is lame i kept saying this game will be the best untill this day has come and i updated the game but after the update i felt the game is being completely trash i mean by trash its lagging and crashing and not even loading hope it will be fixed soon so i can modify my reviwe best wishes
0;"""Dear devs you made MILLIONS of dollars on this game and still you are incompetent to even optimze and program it correctly i feel sorry for your parents. Im sure you blew all the money you got from this game on s and Coke.This is why you have a dying game and surely you won't go poor from this. But you will surely never sell another game because of how bad you are at making them. """"HURP DURP LETS SPAM OUT NEW CLOTHES AND SKINS BEFORE WE FIX THE GAME BUGS HURP HURP"""""""
0;The game could be good but the developers are more interested in putting their hand in your pocket with the pay to open crates than fixing bugs. Money grabbing in other words. And the moderators on the forum delete every thread which draws attention to this. I guess they're just in a hurry to get back to sucking developer Spend your money elsewhere.
0;Buy this game if you want to waste your money on a game that won't start up. This would be a different review if they tested their patches before releasing them. They carpet bomb their customers in the hopes of catching some cheaters and have no care for the ones paying and playing fair who got in the way. Follow the issues on their site and make sure things are fixed before you buy.
0;"""This game is.... trash perhaps more of a bit """"unplayable"""".Here are the reasons Every game is almost exactly same Hiking simulator Unacceptable Bugs TPing/Glitching while the server is bad for 80% of the time Physics that even primary schoolers want to challenge EXPLOSION!!!

0;I think I am going to play pubg nope 10 gig update hmm well whats the update about. 10 gig update for an event where it is grenades and pans only. WTF Every other day its a 10 gig update for some new crap warmode they put out. Im done. I am uninstalling now. Pubg is going to die with the way they are doing it. Hell they can't stop the hackers so their way of improving it is by being very greedy starting event passes and a lot of locked chests. This game is dead to me.

0;Dear Bluehole.This was once one of my favourite games. It used to run decent on my late 2016 Gaming Laptop. And now? Really crappy performace even when I turn down the resolution and use minimal settings. Noone really asked for all that new crap. New maps new guns bla. It's all nice to have when you've got a game that performs good. We used to play with friends evening after evening. That stopped weeks ago. It may be time for you to do something in that direction. Over &amp Out...
0;THE CHEATING IS OUT OF CONTROL. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE...THIS GUY HAS WON 7 OF THE LAST 20 MATCHES HE'S PLAYED HEADSHOTS 57% OF THE TIME K D RATIO IS 6.9 KILLED ME FROM 20 METERS AWAY WHILE LAYING PRONE IN A BUSH MOTIONLESS IN A GUILIE SUIT. https //youtu.be/IdnZFInq5vQhttps //pubg.op.gg/user/wycboy?server asYA THINK HE'S HACKING? lol FFS!
0;there is way to many hackers still in the game and all they have to do is 5$ extra to make another account. there doing nothing to even remotley handle the hackers. the game is constantly still glitchly as all hell and you can even really play over minimum graphics with two gtx 1080s.
0;"""Promissed updates so instead of creating them and investing all that money they got to develop them. They too busy crying about another game which is WAY diffrent how its """"stealing"""" their ideas. So games like CoD Ark etc etc are all original right?"""
0;Now that the game is out fully I can review it how I want... Starting off I can't recommend this game at all. It's a super popular game but at this point its streamer bait. This game has the worse servers ever. Hit dection is just sooooo bad and inventory lag is unbearable. Soooooooo many hackers its 1/3 game you see someone flying and speed hacking. Yes there are very seldom moments of fun but they arent often enough for me to recommened this game.
0;Its fun but there are so many ing issues with this game Ive about had it. This time they gave me a one day ban for NO ING REASON. GET YOUR ING TOGETHER. I got a message saying youve been banned for one day because of suspected illegal software or complaints. I havnt done ing Dont pay for this game when the devs cant even fix things when they have more than enought resources and money.
0;Seriously region lock China. Before Bluehole introduced the deathcam we could all at least pretend we got killed by an skilled player but now its not even debatable that the guy who hip fired your whole team from 600 meters isn't a hacker.Bluehole should stick to making mobile games and resuscitating TERA.
0;Game gets old after a while and you realize that the game actually sucks once you realize the hype is a lie. Also the Player Uknown is a douchee who is full of himself and says he has PTSD from this game. He will probably delete this review because it will hurt his feelings.
0;Very very game would not recommend purchasing until they fixed this You will gaurentee have network lag which will not allow you to jump out of the plane and you will die LOL. Game has over 100% desync shots will not register during a fire fight close range be warned. The PUBG Devs dont care for players as they allow hackers and pay them. One of their workers which is my friend already confirmed that theyre doing this for the money and allow cheats as they get income from it.
0;Terrible exprienced just now especially when the game starting and all building seem made from a bunch of dough further worst that can't enter to the building. Next horrible sound streaming when the bomb drop from the sky Gun sound obviously were marvelous but not for this one.Hope it can be fixed as soon as possible otherwise i felt like pay a money for myself off.Great potential game.
0;An undeservedly extremely profitable glitchy unpolished mess of a game that runs like absolute where the fun is few and far between and they have the audacity to put a paid DLC out? Go yourself vigorously with a mace BlueBalls. I had some hope that they'd have fixed things by now. Never again.
0;This is the most bugged game i ever played .. i got killed so many times by my own ing car and get stucked on the wierdest ing places . The game is not worth 30 euros and the skins are to high price just for u to see them! Don't ing buy this game unlless u want to make a heart attack or get killed just by the mother ing map and its structures . Good luck and thank u for reading this !
0;stopped playing this game because of work and school for a couple months didn t even had enough time to log on steam until i finally log back in to find out that i get permanently banned for no reason contacted steam support and hawkinz and no solution. 10/10 would buy it again.
0;Loved the game pre 1.0 release everything played well was very very happy until my first game of miramar nothing but rubberbanding all the time i have not had one consitent game dying at time critical moments due to lag and rubberbanding i dont understand how a game that ran so well can take such a turn for the worst
0;Great game with great promise however the devs are destroying the game. All they do is release paid lootbox after paid lootbox and now they even have a buggy t battlepass that doesn't even work a quarter of the time. I really enjoy the game but the devs need to pull their heads out their asses.
0;Past over 2 months since last content update new update on test server that was scheduled for the 30th of October is not available and they still not announced new ETA game is dying from chinese hackers and developers don't give a optimization still sucks but they start another tournament.Enjoy your IEM Oakland PUBG Invitational with yourself PUBG corp.
0;Product received for free. excelent game with the randomize equipment. but really need to upgrade the server because too many player login this game and need improvement with the anti cheat because too many cheaters in this game lately. thats why this game little bit disappointing this time. perhaps PUBG can use VAC to prevent cheater in case dota2 and CS go using it. and has less cheater on their games.
0;Over 500 hours played SERVERS Game is full of cheaters macro for auto fire is regular no recoil just spray. The hit reg is u can shot someone in the head watch geforce experience replay and u can see the shots go throught the head and hitting the wall behind them. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GAME DEVELOPER WHO TAKES UR MONEY AND RUN..... FIX UR GAME

0;This used to be my favourite game to play ive had many great times playing it. But its near impossible to play now. it is virtually impossible to play a game without encountering a hacker. i think i will give this game a break until bluehole sort their anti cheating sh!t out. would not recommend this game as it currently is.
0;I actually like this game but the developers are already breaking promises like optimising the game first and dont do microtransactions until the game is fully released and optimised. Also some very unprofessinal stuff from playerunknown in general when you google some things about the game you will see.The main reason for the thumbs down is that the developers broke their promises and (((skype))) the out of the game instead. They just milk the money as long the game has such a high popularity.
0;Playing since Nov 2017 158 hours on record. Then out of nowhere i get banned without a reason for ban and didnt even specify. Developers Why not just go knock at my door at home and spit in my face while ur at it?? what a way to ruin my weekend. Trash Game with Trash System
0;As an avid player of hardcore survival shooters I have logged a lot of hours in this staple battle royal game. The gameplay is challenging and the amount of shootout scenarios one might find themselves in is pretty much endless. However I am not recomending this game due to the amount of rage inducing cheating that occurs in the online matches. Please fix it bluehole Im sick of reporting cheaters without any indication that the problem is being resolved.
0;I myself love this game don't get me wrong but when the developers can't even bother to fix sliding bugs that instantly kill you or manage to get a game such as this servers with more than 20 ticks i can not possibly say to someone oh this game is great go get it and enjoy the full experience
0;Pice of joke of a game that isnt worth the time !desink desink desink never is my ping under 200MS and im on 100 down 60up no OC servers and wheen their was the wait time was a joke wish i never gave these idiots any of my money ! uninstall and never going back !
0;"""I really try to like this game I played a ton in Alpha and it was fine 1.0 was a suprise for me because the game feels like an Alpha so many hackers (20 Million Copies Sold 3 Million of them got BANNED!) those numbers are insane!Then the Servers ... Like Shroud said """"Its not playing against the players you play against the Server.""""In this state I can't recommend buying it.Update Still garbage"""
0;Game itself is fun to play especially now that the 1st person servers are finally a thing. But as always greed has a tendecy to lift it's ugly head when ther is money around. It is a sad thing when company aint happy having on of money they MUST have a metric on.As the greedy policy stands and where that ship seems to be heading I personally cannot recommend the game even though as stated before game itself is fun to play.
0;This game has the worst community all of communitys on the whole earth. Either the enemies are camping like crazy. They wait the whole game in a house just to kill somebody if they have to or they hacking and cheating. E Sports ready? Never. You shoot 20sec earlier than your enemy and hit him and he instantly turns around and 1 shots you. This is t
0;It's pretty ing bad 700 hours clocked the game is fun dont get me wrong but it is ing terrible from lag to dsync to bullets not registering to hitting someone on the hand for 1/8th of the damage to getting sometimes dicked by complete RNG because the loot distribution in this game is utterly terrible to vehicles bugging i left some out but all combine to make a game that is PUBG
0;Worst netcode ever they don't even dare to show you the ping times. You shot somebody 10 times from 10 meters? Doesn't matter it is still you who dies after that from 2 bullets.Update Now you can enable network statistics in options to see the ping ingame.Update2 Even if your ping is good if your enemy has bad ping he will shoot and hit you and your bullet will miss. Worst netcode ever.
0;Really laggy game no matter what connection you have it just doesn t run smooth because servers are terrible. Also nothing got fixed during the past few months and the game is really buggy and has a lot of glitches. At start I was very impressed with the idea of the game and it was really promising but after months have passed I realize that 0 improvements were made.
0;you pubg. I had high hopes I really thought this game would last and survive the test of time.Unfortunately a money hungry publisher ignorant development team and poor decisions made by everyone involved with this game have finally killed it. I still play from time to time but have more negative experiences than positive ones. Waiting desparately for another game to deliver what pubg has promised.
0;This game had the potential to be one of the best mutilplayer games ever. but i find a year on that it as just as buggy and pathetically looked after as ever. Bluehole literally dont care about this game as long as they keep raking in money from it. If you have yet to buy this game... DONT.
0;Ive played this game since release. It was a fun game to play with friends but at this point in time it is terrible. 25Mb updates everyday you have to pay for keys to open chests (which you didn't have to do when the game first launched) and when it should be getting updates to fix the optimization it gets updates for a new cratee instead. Do not waste $30 on this game until it's fixed.
0;Game Devs banning anyone who upsets their precious streamers game banning people for friendly fire continued crap optimization that causes fps spikes on even high end rigs have turned an amazing game to a mediocre one. Once the devs pull their head out of their $$ and match policies for streamers to those of literally everyone else and put more time into polishing the game then the game will truly shine.
0;This game used to be fun prior to official launch. Now it is rampant with cheaters and there isn't even one game that goes by that someone isn't using aim bot or some other new type of cheat. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a complete waste of money and time. Once they get all and I mean ALL cheating under control it will be worth it again but for now this game is run by cheaters with no policing to stop the cheating.
0;Was an awesome game before the flood of cheaters.When people openly cheat with speed and teleport hacks and obviously using aimbots it gets anoying.And with obvious i mean looking through a windo in a room of 3 people turning around in hihspeed and give everyone just enough headshots (2 if you got a helmet) in less then half a second. Before even the people who watched the window could shoot.
0;After 2 days of playtime good game concept.........but........ the lag..................Very frequently you can encounter other players moving like very fast swaping places etc. You can clear your whole clip on a player that wasn't really there. And that is really annoying.Fix the lag and i would recommend it
0;game still severely broken yet devs more interested in microtransactions during EA than fixing the game. going down the track that this game will never be completed once the devs have made their money. best advice to avoid for the time being until the greedy devs get the message.
0;Game filled up with cheaters hitboxes after switching the engine are a joke. Creators don't care about getting rid of the cheaters and after you get banned you can just share the game to another steam library so ban nothing. Before 1.0 release the game was better. Well it looks like it's impossible to keep this type of games good long term.
0;Let me start off by saying this game was TOO fre$h when it came out. The updates kept on coming I sensed a new dawn of gaming among us. But it was very short lived due the HACKERS. Like WTF this game is now unbearable stupid running simulator to end up being headshot by mr. Elastic from the fantastic four with a handgun from 400meters away. To make a long story short folks DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS UNTIL REGION LOCK OR EVEN BETTER HACK FREE. IM SO TRIGGERED.
0;So this game still plays like sh*** they mistakenly ban tons and tons of players because they thought they were cheating has tons of bugs/issues yet they still release a $10 DLC before fixing sime things?!? LOL such a money grab. Can't wait for this developer &amp game to finally go under. They screwed up BIG time with the development &amp priogression of this game.
0;I think we need to re name this game Sniper Unknown Killing Grounds. Tired of getting shot by unseen people who can 1 shot me and never give me a chance to fire back. I can have a level 2 helment and still get 1 shot in the head. Losing interest real fast here.
0;This game is my worst steam purchase and worst purchase in last 5 years. Too many bugs in the game. And I am being killed in every other game by impossible shots. Hacking is a big issue in this game and I don't think PUBG will ever be free of hackers who take all the joy out of the game
0;Buggy game that doesnt look good with a few fun core mechanics. Fun for a group of freinds that just want to mess around and shoot people .Also was banned without warning with no information on why i was banned (never used hacks still not sure why i have been banned)
0;Fun game bad developers. Honestly the game development started out great trying ti fix matchmakings with cross servers and bug fixing but after wards the dev's just look towards the money available. Putting less time into fixing their bug ridden game they chose to release cash grabs. First was crates and now an event pass... Bad dev's focused more on cash then developement.
0;this game use to be fun but only play with friends cause it not region locked so chinese players have flooded the na servers prety much all the servers. i play with nothing but teammates that i cant talk too. dont not buy or play this game unless you want to play byyourself or have a team of 4 at all times
0;Wouldn't recommend this game. The amount of times you need to ask yourself how did I die followed by watching a player just snap to you and kill you instantly is ridiculous. Bluehole doesn't seem to mind though as hackers continuously do it. Not to mention the game is buggy as all hell with cars randomly flying into the air or hitting invisible rocks or even just exploding if positioned wrong. Feels more like in an alpha or beta stage game compared to full release.
0;Poor optimization and general lack of polish with the devs focusing on predatory monetization schemes instead of fixing their game. With how much money this game has made this is inexcusable. Lootboxes season passes and an upfront fee of $30 usd. Compared to their competitors PUBG is seriously lacking.
0;"""Two months later still can't make it through a match without getting killed by someone with a random string of characters for a name popping 400m crossbow headshots on half the map. Guess that's just another issue they're """"taking care of"""" by totally ignoring."""
0;this game used to be good until the chinese took over. 4/5 games with squads im with all chinese. 2/5 of those games they team kill me an take my loot and i haev to report time and time again and the admins do not do anything about it. this game IS fun. but poor control on servers hackers and foreigners flood the servers making it unplayable for the average joe. at the end of the day its the fault of the people controlling this game.
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Its geting worse with every new update.There is no anti cheat at all. Servers overloaded constant lag and bugs that are in the game from begining. Plus new ones with new updates.1 in 4 players is cheating.They baning 100k cheaters a week and same 95k cheater buing game back same day.Only winer Bluehole sold another 95k for same cheaters.75% of players are from China and they can join any server around the world they like. DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME EVER GET BETHER.
0;well the dsync has gotten wores not sure what they are doing but i keep getting shot and killed though doors and walls windows trees watch the death cam and see bullets hitting and going thought all objects . block servers please # make PUNG GREAT AGAIN
0;This game is AWFUL. So many good things but the bad out weigh the good by a lot. you will be killed by people with cheats more than people without (if your any good) and you will be playing in North American servers except with majority chineese people. Take my advise and get fortnite or anything like this game but without the problems they have.
0;the creaters of pubg would not know the difrence between there 3 inch and there own hand they ruined the game by trying to coppy fortnight and add battle pass not only that but you have to spend 60$ just to get the game the game when ot first came out even tho it had ishues with rendering and like that was good it was fun but then the cheating glitches ecsetera... i highly do not recomend this game i would have back when it first came out but now sollid no
0;Honestly it's too late for buying this game to be worth it it's on a downward spiral at this point. just play fortnite or realm royale$30 game with a less consumer friendly monetization model than it's free to play competitors devs don't care about fixing the game so it has longevity just extracting as much money from it as they can before the bubble pops
0;taking away the option to choose which map to play on 80 percent of the time the server is going to be trash the game is literally getting worse with every single update only cosmetics are added so they can cash out more before the game is dead no region lock which makes the servers even worse a huge amout of cheaters
0;This game has been out for more than a year now and it still does not run properly it is poorly optimized. The only thing this comapny cares about is it's sound designs (which is just having the ability to hear your teammates footsteps like it's asmr) and throwing apples. Please save your money
0;Wasted 800 hours on this trash game hoping that they would improve it. There is still tons of cheaters the servers are so bad that you are getting shot 1 2 secs behind walls. Don't waste your time BlueHole will never fix this game. They are more interested in making more loot boxes to suck every dime from its deminishing user base.
0;The game is fun but incredibly broken and the devs aren't helping.Between disabling keybindings to jump over knee high walls before the vaulting is ready for launch and threatening to ban people for editing their configuration files I just can't recommend people buy from this developer.Aaaand of course now they've brought in ads to a paid game...great.
0;finally deleted its only gotten worseinb4 they ask for developer of the year nominationThis game is so bad now lmao. The optimization was never good the hackers are still rampant and none of the mechanics make up for any of this. It seems it's just getting worse each patch they introduce oh and nothing like milking the cow for skins lmao
0;it's a game don't play it like really don't it's full of t and you'll only find yourself screaming and destroying any relations you have built up with your friends and family. like if someone gives this to you just smack their face and in their parent's mouths
0;If you haven't buy this game yet i suggest you not to. Because there is alot of wallhackers aimbot and so on player in this game. Don't waste your money on this game Dev wont listen to player Dev only care about all of your in game purchase... Thats all ) i waste my 2000hours in this game waiting for dev to improve.. but seems like BLUEBALL Doesnt care about it )
0;This is one of those games that require you to have a ing super computer. Once you you sell your kidneys to get one then your net sucks. Especially after the new update around the month of October 208 this game just itself. I HAVE NEVER PLAYED A SINGLE ING MATCH THAT EITHER HASN'T LAGGED OR ING WORKED CORRECTLY IN GENERAL. BUNCH OF AMATEURS CREATED THIS GAME.
0;PUBG 1.4? Officially released my ing THIS IS THE MOST BUGGY GAME YOU WILL EVER ING PLAY. THE GREEDY DEVS THAT MADE OVER 1 BILLION IN REVENUE BUT CANT FIX THEIR ING BUGS. 20 PEOPLE ALIVE AND I HAVE GREAT LOOT. CHICKEN DINNER? NO ! ITS A FLAWLESS ING GAME THAT WILL SUDDENLY TELEPORT YOU BEHIND A ING POLE AND A WALL WHILE YOU CANT MOVE AND GET STUCK THERE FOREVER. YOU BLUEHOLE YOU FOR THIS BUGGY GAME. YOU GREEDY I HOPE YOU BURN IN HELL FOR YOUR GREED. YOUR ING GODS.
0;games ok my only problem is how long it takes this company to release any content i dont know how long i been waiting for this new map but months go by and its still not been released.... then you look at other games like fortnite as bad as it is they are releasing content way quicker. pick up your game blue hole can only play the same maps and same modes for so long....
0;"""I bought the game since Early Access one thing developers need to improve is Anti Cheat system I found a lot of cheaters since my first time playing this game til 2018 I mean come on. And fanboy still saying """"Go for FPP"""" it doesn't make any sense developer shall remove TPP then."""
0;If you like battleroyals it might be your thing. Beware the moneygrabbing cosmetics.If your not particulary fond of BRs then it's just a massive ClusterFack simulator where the rules of physics don't ing apply.I ing hate Fortnite but that's free and this one's ing expensive for what it is.IMHO even the ever buggy nowhere nearly finished with 5 years in the making DayZ gives a better experience.
0;the amount of people who cheat in this game is outrageous almost all of the people at the top of the leader board have 80% headshot kills im no expert but that sounds pretty fishy to me keep an eye on the kill log if you do play chances are someone will make headshot after headshot in a matter of minutes which if you ask me should be improbable
0;This was fun to play with friends then more and more cheaters appear in each and every game. Hard to play anymore something should have been done with the cheating by now. If they could get a handle on all of the cheats going rampant it would be enteraining again.
0;Breaking promises as soon as in EA is always a bad sign.Wether microtransactions are to stay or not I don't really care but Bluehole and PU lying about it is a bad sign. I cannot recommend the game based on the current clinch between Bluehole and the community.
0;The devs need to learn how to make decent anti cheat. Also the desync gets worse with every update. This fix pubg campaign is a joke they should have fixed it while it was in early access. They focused more on adding content than fixing the game and it has suffered this far because of it.
0;I REALLY want to love this game.... But HACKERS are in almost every game. To the point where it isn t fun no more and I feel like instead of fixing it they put their time and money into other places. Emotes and new maps coming out of beta .. porting to console . but they haven t still fixed hackers??? Its almost like they rather ban them and not fix the problem making them have to buy a new key. So it makes them more profit. At least that s what it feels like to me.
0;Bugs things that need to be balanced poor optomization etc... wait till the game gets the fix it needs before purchasing / Edit been a few months and the game has gotten more optomization so it runs a bit better. region locking definetley needs to be implemented.
0;it's a good game but sadly there are too many noobs cheating lately. I never ever write a bad review about a game before but this is just too much. I can compromise a cheat from ten games I played but 3 out of 5 games has cheaters? that's ridiculous. I won't change the review until the cheat problems are fixed.
0;PUBG developers are money grubbing no good rotten yella belly sap suckin milk drinking vampires that are suckin every drop of revenue left from this failed game because they are to cheap to actually optimize the game and add a progression system to actually want to play the game.
0;I can say after playing this game for a very long time. They have not 'FIXED' the game like they said Graphics are still terrible lag still exists desyncing is still exists. 4 3 resolution has not been added yet. Instead they force 16 9 to other players because of their horrible coding. Bullets still don't register into people. They add new guns and maps instead of actual fixes to the game... 10/10 ign.
0;This game was awesome..... It is so broken now. Between the lag spikes and cheaters you are lucky to make it 2 min without some ridiculous death. They seem more focused on selling ingame swag than monitoring or fixing what they already have. I see less cheating in FTP games.
0;"""Bluehole anticheat previously crashed my game saying that matlab.exe and baiduIME.exe are malware.Now I got false banned probably because of visualstudio.exe or my school project windowsformapplication1.exe.Support completely useless and cannot say which .exe exactly caused that """"for security reasons"""".Goodbye pubg. Was fun knowing you."""
0;I have been playing this game for a while and after countless hours I lost interest because of the bad care this game gets.Every new update is about in game purchases and the new map most people are waiting for is not coming.I hope this will change I really liked it.
0;WTF!? this game was so good you have killed it with a ing insanely updates (downgrades). i have never had a game that gets worse as worse after updates. im getting 10fps on a $1500 gaming destop. first you take away voice chat and now this. seriously you have 20million copies sold thats alot of ing money and cant fix your listen to you audience ffs. and seriously get rid of hackers this game will be lost if you cant fix So mad rn.
0;Current statistics show that out of the over 20 million people who have purchased this game over 8% of that number have been banned. The chances of getting into a game with 100 people will result in roughly 8 people hacking. This company has recieved nearly a BILLION dollars and is still somehow unable to provide the most basic fixes.
0;The early access is currently trash tickrate has gone down can't even get to the main menu since it can't connect 4 out of 10 games has network lag detected Before the last 3 updates the game has gotten bad I used to like this game what's going on Pubg studios you forgot how to gamedev since you made your own studio. I'll change my review if the final release is good. but the game in it's current state is bad.
0;Could be the best iteration of battle royale yet but it's falling down the stupid tree and hitting every branch on the way to the bottom. The devs refuse to fix major known issues and instead break more things with each patch. Also every other game (at minimum) you will be killed by a Chinese cheater.The only positive is that I made back the cost of the game and then some by selling the stupid in game loot boxes.DO NOT BUY until Bluehole gets their together and region locks China.
0;As writing this I'm #254 in NA Solo FPP and I cannot recommend this game.It's broken Replays have a 70% chance of crashing when opening Lag compensation is terrible &gt avoid any head to head fights as they are coin flips &gt replays are inaccurate from poor lag handling reflects the crappy fights Loading cities and loot is inconsistent Vaulting walls is inconsistentI hope they fix it.
0;Dev and publisher out for that cash grab instead of actually improving the quality of the game. Charging for a game pass on top of the game is a perfect example. Locking rewards behind a payway is another. Slow development for bug fixes and focus on things they can get a monatary charge out of their customers. For a game that had such massive potential when it was released in alpha they have fallen miles behind competetors in the genre.
0;Lag desync still in 2018 15 July. A lot of cheaters. This game is not a compatitive PVP game maybe someday it will be. Right now its a fun dying simulater with friends. Dont get me wrong you will have fun when you a ready to laugh at your deaths even if they are impossible from your prespective.
0;Sometimes it's fun... Sometimes it's repetitive and boring. The lack of modes to make it different from other games and above all the awful performance leaded me to write a negative review. I know it's an early access but they are planning to release it soon.Whenever they optimize it I'll remove the negative review. At this moment even if you manage to get +80 fps playing in the lowest settings it still feels lagged and bugged.EDIT after more than a year it's the same or even worse. Wow.
0;Can't play in Aus to many hackers. Hackers generally don't play in their own region Aus has 30 million people. Anyone saying the problem isn't as bad as they make it sound aren't playing with our tiny player pool.I reinstal this game every couple of monthes and it never improves.Dev's make to much money banning people then selling them the game again will never get fix or region lock which sucks becuase I'd rather play this over fortnite.STILL Unplayable in Aus
0;"""How the can they take my money but 7/10 i go on to play some pubg and apparently """"the servers are too busy"""" ing upgrade the servers then will the the money you've taken of the community u wouldn't pay a penny for this as game wouldn't buy it even if my dog was going to die unless i brought it that put this in the free to play section."""
0;"""I got this game the first day of steam summer sale and I like it a lot. The only problem I am now having which for some reason started happening today is I can literally only get matched with Chinese players on NA servers. I have gone into 30+ duos matches and they have all been chinese(You can also tell by the name because all of them are so similar like """"HMT60034"""" or """"C000032"""""""
0;Don t buy this game! Ez servers are too busy ez huetaImpossible to play in current state while servers are too busy.27/04/18 Older Versions Don t buy this game! Ez cheats ez huetaImpossible to play in current state while they don t make some kind of anticheat.21/02/18
0;To buggy at the start of each round. Impossible to tell the reason why u died with the current netcode.Update 15/05 2018Lag and some other stuff have been fixed and runs much better now. I can still not recommend the game though They ruined the gameplay with their big weapon balance update. Shooting in this game nowaday feels dreadfull and aint as fun as it used to be.
0;Can't remember the last time I had fun playing this game. I've tried to play it on and off for the past few months and it's just boring. New maps guns and scopes don't fix the fundamental issues with this game. Just feels like the devs are adding useless stuff to distract from how terrible this game really is.
0;Hackers in 4 out of 5 games on the OC server at the moment (and probably only didn't see them in the 5th game due to dieing on the terrible bike mechanics. Apparently hit an invisible block and spazed out). The game is unplayable at the moment. Rapid fire from across the map or tracking you behind walls. They're not even hiding the fact that they're cheating anymore.
0;Used to be good but now they are money hungry animals that keep breaking the game with these stupid updates and trashy e league system get good or get out and learn something player unknown or i will kick you though a window like the doc did. No wonder why fortnite has more money and players coming in i mean this load of trash needs to be doused in fuel and then set a light so we can cure this cancer.
0;This game absolutely needs a region lock. Almost every lobby is guaranteed to have a Chinese hacker using aimbots and desynch. As you can tell by my hours (With about 100 more in test servers) I really love this game. Ever since late December there has been a massive influx of hackers. PLEASE FIX THIS BLUEHOLE!!!!!!
0;Great game but cheaters are really getting out of control and even though they say they have an anti cheat system in place it really seems not to be working Every single game you find a cheater. If they could solve this this game would be the best but its just really annoying to play it right now and not fun at all.
0;"""Pretty bad support and nothing else than disgusting greediness from the developers. Never seen so many useless """"updates"""" in a row likes emotes skins and ing season passes with no actual content! It is only to ing rip off customers and little kids. Shame on this lazy and greedy studio. Hope they crash as hard as possible!"""
0;This game makes me wish fortnite wasn't a spam building casual jump fest with inaccurate and random ing weapons.Mechanically the gameplay is better than fortnite but the rewards system in this game is absolute trash.&gt Play 2 3 hours to afford a crate (oh and your next crate will take you double the time).&gt Buy a crate&gt Get a crate that you now have to pay $2.50 to open. off.
0;I don't hate or discriminate Chinese people. But In this game they are idiots and many of them are hackers. and they are everywhere.when you go to EU NA servers 80% of users are Chinese I don't know how could this possible. and I doubt BLUEHOLE has any regulation of hakers.It seems to me that they are using hack programs forever.however I CAN'T quit this SO I'm gonna blame them. FXX....
0;Fun game if it was optimized. GARBAGE servers constant desync lag/rubber banding and sub par physics optimization make almost every experience you have in this game frustrating and unenjoyable. Will update review if they every get this together. Shoudlve spent their topurnament money on better devs..
0;Basically just a race for the devs to see if they can make this game not a buggy laggy piece of before the game dies completely. The writing is on the wall though so it looks like the devs are focused on hyper monetising this game while the gittin's good rather than adding any real longevity.
0;Filled with cheaters focusing on microtransactions broken and buggy poorly optimized store bought assets EVERYWHERE ego maniacal creator who only cares about money charging for private servers with no option to host your own balance issues and did I mention the creator is a complete knob? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY
0;its part of the game but its way too luck based. i can never pick up ARs if i go to small towns and i can never pick up a gun if i go to big towns(just end up dying) what can they do about this? nothing. but seriously pisses me off when i die helplessly within 10 seconds of the game starting and i have to wait another 5 minutes for the game fill up wait 60 seconds wait for the plane and just dive down
0;Absolute trash of a game with no end in sight to annoying bugs that show up every update.By selecting a talentless company from South Korea to make the game Brendan Greene has deprived millions of loyal players the proper battle royale game they rightfully deserve.PUBG 2.0 made entirely from scratch by a competent company is the only thing saving this ing title.
0;i have 1.5 k hours in this game and im posting a review saying its the worst thing ever just ignore my 1.5k hours of playtime which would probably suggest me liking the game as i got 1.5k hours in a game thats been available for slighlty over a year im putting it as not recomended because its hip and cool to on anything bluehole does.
0;do not recommend because the servers are unstable as . many times the client just crashes and wont let you press the start button or it even doesn't connect you to the main menu. my advise would be to wait until this game ever comes out of early access. (sorry for bad english)
0;Game is crap do no invest peny in this game because game is full of cheaters 20 30 players in each match have all sort of cheats from wallhacking aim recoil speedhack noise hack instant heal instant revive distance measuring car speed hack weapon spon hack and all other hacks.
0;The game is flooded with cheaters.After update there is even more cheaters then everbefore. Do not buy this game!! There is less players and only the cheaters are left.There has been a new update and now its simply a joke!! the Hit Reg is about 40% lag has increased so every 3 game is unplayable This game and Devs are a Joke!!!
0;"""Great gunplay game mechanics and a huge amount of replayablity. Too bad its all thrown out the window with terrible servers latency bullet registration and etc.... Not to mention the devs put more energy into paid loot crates and """"event passes"""" than they do in optimization and real content. I've played a lot of hours hoping that these issues would be resovled and now almost a year and a half after release I've officially lost hope. Waiting for something else to take its place..."""
0;This game was fun when playing with friends but the hackers have ruined this game. Now there are more games where I am pegged in the head with an AKM from insane distances/speed in 3rd person than not. I've seen the devs ban people over bugs but seem to ignore a major issue of someone purposfully messing up their game. Also you have to pay $2.50 to open certain boxes that you already spent a ton of BP on which is absurd.
0;Why pay $30 for something that is less optimized and less polished than a game that costs nothing. This game would rather use resources to sue competition instead of fixing their own game because they believe that other games are the reason of their downfall when in reality they shot themselves in the foot with their t in the past months.
0;One step forward three steps back. After the last update matchmaking takes from minute to few minutes to complete the lobby is so buggy it even fails to load sometimes. Servers are basically potatoes for a shooting game 150ms ping is unacceptable. Game optimisation is still poor... Shame I really love this game it's really really fun especially when playing with friends.
0;You seriously could not have messed up more. I was finally happy when my framerates were consistent and did not drop every time I go shot or dropped next to people. That is no longer the case. How could you have possibly made the game run worse after fixing your issues? Not only that but you have off most of your playerbase and supporters. Wake up and fix your game before its too late.
0;If you look for a game that delivers something.. just something... for this price...keep searching. This game is full of bugs no support the developers rather implement new things to get your money instead of improving the actual game so just try to avoid everything related to this game
0;"""This game is unoptimized as hell. I have a medium tier gaming PC and I average about 20 fps. Every once in a while the game will crash my entire computer. It's fun when I can actually play it but overall this is garbage.UPDATE FPS has improved slightly. However I am still off at Bluehole. They seem to not know what they should work on and instead work on small stuff.""""The game is broken and unoptimized? Okay new map!!!"""" Blueballs Entertainment"""
0;There's sufficient evidence to show that a Chinese Game anchor named Lu Benwei working for the Douyu TV has cheated in PUBG during his working time. But the Bluehole seems to turn a blind eye to such a immoral behavior.As a common player I can't stand the Bluehole's attitude to illegal software.That's all I want to share about PUBG.
0;Paid $30 for a game I can not connect to. Servers are constantly busy which would be one thing but this game has already sold a rediculous amount of copies buy some more damned server space. Developer took away ability to use reshader with latest update and things seem to be MORE user unfriendly. Ban are abitrary at best. Already monetizing game before problems are fix. I feel scammed at this point...
0;"""Stopped playing 9 months ago with the hopes that issues would be fixed with the """"Fix PUBG"""" program this did not happen. The game has gotten steadily worse the more money the developers rake from it as they know that more microtransactions and season passes are worth more to them than any respect from their community. Until this point I have never seen a game get worse and seem somehow less polished after leaving early access."""
0;As much as I love playing PUBG the lack of completion and the deteriorating FPS in this game hinders its' performance to such a degree that I just can't enjoy playing it. As it is now I do not enjoy playing Pubg nor would I recommend anyone else to get addicted to it.
0;"""The more you play it the more you realise how bad the game is.Getting banned for """"stream sniping"""" snipe me pls.I invested $29.99 and now i cant get it back.Developers breaking promises just what i wanted.Servers have delays most of the time and I hate the 600 ping chinese cheaters.Game comes free with a lot of bugs.Lots of hackers included.Game doesn't obey the law of physics.#RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina#RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina #RegionLockChina4/10"""
0;Last Update This game is full of sh*t now that COD4 is out i can see this game going into the trash full of cheaters game is just terrible full of campers no real achievement to the game. Honestly don't waste your money on this game just go buy blackout you will get enough enjoyment out of that game than you will on this pile of sh*t.
0;"""Broken game dev's don't care about fixing it. Worthless loot crates """"patches"""" only break the game and make it worse. The only recent changes to the game have been the addition of more cosmetic items you have to pay to unlock.This game had potential if the resources were used to make the actual game better but instead they are only targeting ways to squeeze more money from cosmetic items out of the payerbase before it dissapears completley."""
0;The gameplay is good but developers are not doing anything to fix the fps problems... We sometimes got FPS drops to 3 4 when you engage into battle or lag desync... its very bad and the devs are focusing on adding new content and making micro transactions to get even more money... gready people
0;Dear potential buyers here is a review of mine.80% of my time i have to use my bind key to mute the ingame volume (sound is bad overal not optimized not compressed) u can get deaf ? yes you can if u not watchout.This is just 1 of the main thing theres is so many other things that annoy you... but instead of that the devs wil release new cases and skins... They dont listen to community at all.
0;I played this game from almost the very start all the way to almost the present. I am beyond disappointed. I don't think I've actually enjoyed the game since November/December 2017. Seeing all these other Devs of other BR games do so much better at their job. It's a shame really that PUBG and that horrendous H1Z1 have shared the same fate.
0;Absolutely no hit detection at all. They made a small bug fix to fix hit registration at long distances and while they did this they destroyed any type of close to mid range combat. The lag on the servers is still horrible. Good lucking dropping at a high population place because youll just lag around until someone kills you.

IDIOT GAME !!! DOG GM !!! GO DIE CORONY HACKER R !!!
0;I don't recommend this game until they do something about the hackers. Region lock China. 46% of the player base comes from China yet 99% of the cheaters come from China. Can you take a guess at what servers they all play on? Not Asian... Can't recommend until they ban cheaters or region lock China.
0;This game has too many issues that take away from gameplay. As it is now the UI constantly crashes and party matching does not work well. When you land in a busy place where you need to frag out the lag makes this more about RNG than anything else. Cool concept bad execution.
0;They released a 10GB update (!!) to improve the health of the game (not adding anything new). The game still lags there is shuttering fps drops and the game almost freezes when entering a new area. This game is great but needs fixing those problems appear even on high end PCs. Cannot recommend it as it is out of early access and it is still such in bad state. You will get tired of those problems after some time playing this game.
0;if you live in middle east you have to play in the asia servers with 200 ping and 5%loss pocket beacuse you cant change your server 2/10 times loading screen will crashworst opt for a pc game and i do not think they can fix it this game is trash just dont buy it until they fix the game instead of adding more cosmetics for more money
0;So many bugs so disappointed when you stuck in something.So many cheaters you won't play any game after killed by cheaters constantly.The driving system is trash the car always pumps into the air.The Game Optimization is trash my PC can run some other games with much better graphic AND more FPS.Review after 2K+ hours playing.
0;Positive Great gameplay and replayabilityCons Like most early access games the developers are going back on previous statements and slowly turning PUBG into games such as H1Z1. They have been talking about new maps and new features for months. Now their going to implement a gambling system ($2.50 a piece) for skins instead.
0;this game sucks so many hackers i cant enjoy myself. instead of adding new attachments and maps how about stopping hackers and make your stuff actually work. for the love of all things holy i wanna play a fair realistic shooter. 25 rounds enemy is still up one round and i die instant? the heck is wrong with this game.
0;Terrible game terrible gaming experience terrible custom service.Blue have no idea for handle cheating behaviors.But they thought that they can do it so they use a ing client with bugs to make normal player can't play that ing game. ing Blue ing kuso game.
0;As it stand this game is so close to actually being a good game but currently its so broken its unreal buggy net code is horrendous generally the idea is good the execution is average they now seem more interested in esports and emotes than actually fixing the game its a real shame Early access programme is exploited this way game should still be in EA and no where near close enough to be released
0;Over having 300 hours gametime i would give it a positive review because when a game has no hackers its one of the best battle royale game out there. But chinese should get region locked as they are infesting their hacks on all servers. Every game i played in the last few days had a hacker in it where he headshots our whole squad in seconds. Until Bluehole does something about hackers dont buy this game.
0;tried to play this piece of garbage compititively for a while was decent then came the patches updates which didnt work and wtf is fix pubg? the devs up and dont even acknowledge that they did. its unplayable as of now switching back to r6s.will update if things get betterEDIT matchmaking time is now fixed along with ping issues as of 16 OCT 2018game almost unplayable 17 Oct 2018game playable but plenty bugs 23 Nov 2018
0;PUBG is one of my favourite games of all time for about 10 months it was an absolute blast to play.But unfortunately the developers are probably the most incompetant I've ever encountered in 20+ years of gaming and this is saying a lot in a world with Activision Blizzard and EA.No OCE (AU/NZ) support at all for the last 8 months is incredibly disappointing and there is no sign of it improving at all.
0;i really liked this game but latley? nothing but HACKERS and FPS drops just a horrible game. ALl its turned out to be is a cash grab. And the event pass is a joke! pay money for event pass then earn rewards that expire when the event ends? that has to be the dumbest micro transaction ever!
0;Full of cheaters brutal lag (my zone) etc etc .... last update with faster zones is forcing people to jump in the middle of the map making every match ends faster &gt cheaters earning lootboxes much fasterThis company is only here to implement more loot crates.
0;I ve had so much fun on this game until...So I decided to play in Asian servers since the American ones were down until further notice. I played a couple rounds no hassle until my game crashed. I reopened it and there were two unclose able ads on the lobby page making the game unplayable. I couldn t click on anything. I uninstalled and reinstalled to find it still there and nothing I ve tried has gotten the ads away. I haven t played pubg in 2 weeks due to this and it better get fixed soon.

0;"""So they've put this """"Event Pass"""" in the game wich is 10 ing .... Why !? They were like """"Yeah Fortnite has this thing right?And they also charge money for it so why shouldn't we ?"""" I can tell you why. Because you have to pay to even play this game! Now it really looks like they're only after the money. Well done Blueballs! You ed up again you morons."""
0;"""70% of the player base is gewk hackers. Get a decent anticheat.And add the option to choose the map. I don't want to play your desert map. I didn't pay $40 for this game to have you idiots change the map on me.Also why do you have to do 3 hours of maintenence every single day?Can't even play the game half the time.And my favorite part is when I get kicked for """"corrupted"""" data every second game."""
0;I played for over 100 hours on this game and still being a literal freshman. otherwise i had over 10 years fps and tps game experience i wonder how the game being so idiot and once the person stood still in front of me like 3 meters away and i kept my front sight on shoot like 5 or 6 seconds but miss all the shoot.another thing is about the players who ridiculouly tried to obtain happiness from plugin and bug the company did the least thing
0;At the moment the game is INFESTED with chinese hackers who take advantage of ping and desync and play on NA and EU servers ruining the game for everyone else. The game still has optimization issues for example your FPS will drop dramatically inside buildings but will stay stable in open fields. Also lag and desync is still very prevalent which is annoying. The game still feels Early Access and still has a lot to improve on.
0;Okay this is ridiculous. 31 03 2018. And the game is unplayable.. With this popularity and that much money earned it's unforgivable to run out of server capacity. Its not worth anybodys time anymore. The game had so much potential yet threw it all down the crapper. And the amount of crashes now??!? (i have high end gaming pc)... Seriously Hunt Showdown in its 0 167 early access is running better than this crap.DONT WASTE TIME AND MONEY ON THIS
0;Pubg corp thought they'd repay the community for bringing it to #1 played and top seller for ages by disabling trading because they weren't making their 3%. Because god forbid people want to trade their stuff for a currency that's not locked to buying steam games and losing 15% of its value in the process.
0;In its current format would strongly advise not getting the game. It's completely filled with hackers more than ever now. I've dabbled in the pro scene and for customs this game is great. But relaxing? No. I'm getting killed by someone I can 100% say is a cheater maybe 4/10 games questionably a cheater in 3/10 games. So thats only 3/10 games that are actually enjoyable / competitive. They released a new anti cheat system? in a recent patch. That just seems to have brought more hackers.
0;If you like to play a game that crashes every other game this is the game for you. How does a game this popular not figure this stuff out. Not to mention all of the HACKERS on this garbage of a game. Now on the positive side when this game does work it can be fun. Please fix issues or this game will lose fan base.
0;If you ever wanted to end up in a mantal asylum for anger issues because of a game well that is the game for you. The wide variety of bugs no hit registration wearing armor and not counting it will sure as hell drive you insane. Also The Devolopers they decide to introduce new maps but not fix bugs or optimize the game. If you think about buying it just don't. It is better to hit your toe every day than playing this stupid bugged game. Would refund if i could.
0;The game is ok but the devs love your money and they show it in the game at every corner. Selling everything for money is total not ok. Pay for the game pay for the pass pay for skins pay for keys pay for a shirt (5 bugs really) pay for xp. Don t buy anything to teach them a lesson
0;physics graphics aiming not optimised no hype to motivate the community ''esports ready''.I mean comme on I have 60 70 fps in GTA V on high settings and on this I have hardly 70 fps on medium low settings.Then you got the amazing map physics Bumping into nothing while you're driving and losing 3/4 of your HP trying to enter a car while spamming ''F'' then just getting rolled over.Need a hell lot of improvment for the money it costs.
0;I've played 275 hours of this trash and I would like to say that I have never played a less polished game in my life. Glad I didn't pay full price. Don't waste your time on this. There are so many bugs that don't even get fixed while they release ugly skins in colors that no one likes. Having problems with glitches and getting caught in trees while parachuting down? Nah here's a new map that is less optimized than the previous. Still better than Fortnite though...
0;This game will surly raise your blood pressure and can give bad health if you continue to play this game and meet all the fkin chinese hackers you will surly regret pruchasing a broken un fun game i wish i can get my 30$ back. this game can go to hell DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
0;Well if you want to die from shotgun on 1 hit from 25 30 m .... this game is for you 2017 After i year of not playing this game the game doesn't change at all . Skins skins skins and one more time skins . Developers care only about selling 'em and how to make a new one . And putting the game in 1.0 u have to be kidding me ? The game have a lot of issues so at this point no )
0;This game use to be fantastic it was probably better in its Alpha/Beta stages than it is now... Game has turned into a big camping land mess! New connection system is bad with constant packet loss skips FPS is worse and map design is built for the campers... I constantly get shot when I'm behind cover on the enemies screen its just a never ending mess. 1/10.
0;This title started out strong selling millions of copies.Yet for all the copies sold the developers sure know how to thank those who have supported the title by not opitimising the game and failing to provide any meaningful updates within respectable time frames. A plethora of bugs cheats and hacks still plague the game.Last but not least the game looks like a late 2000 era title and runs much much worse then a newer and better looking game.
0;great game...except EVERY SINGLE MATCH IM KILLED BY A HACKER! i don't understand this?! get some anti cheat going....all you have to do is look at the leaderboards to see some of the most obvious hackers my god........the game is no longer fun...its just getting worse every day that i play......FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;This game is good in many way but top fail of this game isMeeting a lot of cheater almost every match.they hit you from behide building or mountain.they know where you are no way to hide.and some has nice aimbotif they got BAN they will come back soon LOL
0;IMO this game should still be in beta phase because its optimalization the rate of bugs and glitches is so freaking high that its anoying. Also it litteraly has to crash everyday at least once. Its unfortunate that i have more negative memories than the positive ones. So if zou hesitate to buy pubg its just not worth it.
0;game ing goldmine for em. 5/10 times I have to sign out and log back in to join a ing game. About that ridiculous netcode you can t even say a word it is that bad. I never know I contributed to charity till the day I bought this game. It s a ing joke. peace
0;Started off great now i regret ever grabbing this game so many issuse and if u want to play a game which u enjoy and relaxes u even tough its a shooting game never ever ever get this game u'll regret it especially if u're not so good at shooting games.
0;Really skilled based game based on chance...It's been well over a year and nothings really changed still buggy af 1 or 2 new maps and a couple of guns off Bluehole you cretinsEdit Almost been a year and the graphics are still terrible hackers are still everywhere Ring of Elysium is f2p and has better combat mechanics
0;Unplayable lag and laughable hit detection. Countless invisible walls glitched areas that upon wandering into trap the player broken accessory system reticles rarely correspond to impact points and rampant cheaters from China. It's a nice concept but this game is ing broken and has literally no application to competitive play due to the absolute randomness of it.
0;As a plyer in the middle easy here is my review 1 No middle east servers meaning you ethier gonna go for asia (all chinese annoying ) or eu *which half of them are chinese btw * 2 huge noticable delay you fight someone you rush for the tree before you get last hit and he hit you when u already took cover in that tree make me wanna kms3 if u have an hdd or 8gb of ram don't bother to play the game (texture take ages to load)4 So many bugs and you die if u jump out of a 45 mph speed bike bs
0;Pubg getting worse and worse. It's so sad I loved this game but at the moment it lags and crashes more than you have good moments. So for me it's time to say good bye to Pubg...update I thought i could give it another couple of shots but it's unbelievable pubg is getting even worse and worse.so it's just one thing i have to say to this game and that is YOU. how the hell can you destroy a game like this
0;Had it since early access. Hoped they would clean it up and tie it together nicely so it would run smooth at 1.0 launch they didn't. Instead they monitized. Haven't played except occasions since a couple patches after 1.0. Wish I could get my money back what a waste.
0;I love to play this game solo or with friends. Its a fast pass game that takes skill out playing others and luck. Ok alot of luck. But even though they have region locked chine. The cheating is as bad as ever. Since they removed the kill came I have no way of knowing if a person was cheating or not. Those an lucky kill gets a perons a cheat report casue well how the did they do that.
0;pubg has an identity crisis. it's in uncanny valley. the realism is a joke and only hinders the game. this is why fortnite sees a large success. the arcade aspects suck because the mechanics aren't tight and the hit boxes are trash. if counterstrike couldn't fix their hit detection issues with HITSCAN weapons in a 5v5 to 10v10 matches then why on earth do you think some nobodies would be able to do it with 100 players in a single match?
0;"""Even tho i have run into like 2 hackers I have to admit this game hasn't gotten better at all. It was a lot of fun at start but this game still feels really """"really"""" unoptimized and the lack of updates makes it worse. Theres nothing new only crates. Its not fun anymore. xd"""
0;Loved this game since Early Access however I can't implore you enough. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIVE IN OCEANIA30 minute+ wait time for matches for many matchmaking queues some are shorter but still 10 15 minutes. Many PUBG games last only 2 minutes depending on where you drop so its seriously not worth the queue time. Spend your money elsewhere.
0;I actually didnt realize hacking was a recent issue.. i can say that the game was reallly reaaallly fun when it first came out we could snag at least a few wins a week. i havnt had a win in weeks and normally i wouldn't think twice. UNTIL i read about the recent hacking situation cant help but to think the two are related. still a fun game but a solid NO until more hack defense is implimented other than reporting case by case.
0;once a good game but hacker is out of control now and i feel ashame of being chinese due to the ing pack of chinese hackers in this game. Well done. one more game down you guys can take down all these games until one day there are nobody making games anymore. buy this game and face hackers end.
0;over the cause of Pubg from the beta all the way to now i have experienced good and bad things and because of some of these bad things such as the resent regin lock locking people to servers with mega ping over 300 i just can't play this game anymore.
0;The game only got buggier during the 3 months I've played it.But the developers do no care about that instead of fixing horrifying bugs or the game's net code they spend their working time creating new costumes to sell for real money.Don't buy this game. Or try it to know what everyone's talking about and then refund it. Don't give these s your money
0;fun....or what?the netcode is a joke lag every game no sync in any ways cheaters EVERY game to release this game as 1.0 is a joke and is just sending an signal to everyone that games this unfinnished is okay to publish as a finnished game.FIX your game!if not its just a matter of time before it dies out completely only reason half of my friendlist plays this game at this state is cuz everyone else is..........
0;"""The game play is an amazing concept and at times this game is so fun! however the ammount of errors that this game has evne for a beta is really ilting and somtimes I wish I had never purchased it. Buy at your own risk often the games """"play"""" button won t even load."""
0;The only thing to say is I loved this game as in past tense.. before it was infected with overflowing chinese hackers. Solid advice probably more enjoyable on console if the fps is bearable**EDIT** coming back to try this out months later and the hacking is visibly 10x worse i honestly don't believe anybody should waste their money on a ing joke of a developer like bluehole.Just region lock the chinese jesus christ its not that ing hard.
0;when I was in a game ''my friend said are you still playing trash game'' then I said lol go play fortnite and died by bug while in car. nvm started fortnite same as albino then I decided It is better than pubgminecraft with guns &gt pubgdont spent anything at this game
0;Have a pc with gtx 1080 ti or gtx 660 (doesent matter) When you land the loot doesent render When you land you have about 20 30 fps Even if you survive the early fight in mid game a cheater will shoot you before even coming out of cover Paid about 25$ for this game and to do the new missions you have to pay another 10$? + it is not pernament its for only 30 days lolNo wonder why you lost about 1million average players past 2 months this game is too poorly optimized. )
0;"""The game is broken in so many ways. Its pretty clear they are more interested in adding content that is just a money grab rather than fixing the glaring issues. I wish we would all stop buying Alpha games. Push developers to finish a damn game before tearing into peoples wallets and putting out a """"game"""" thats no more than a half effort."""
0;I can deal with all the optimization pitfalls with this game but if Bluehole doesn't get their act together with all the cheaters in the game I can't see myself playing it much longer. It's incredibly frustrating to have over half your games filled with cheaters of some kind.

0;Edit 27/03/18 Still unplayable but now with weapon skins.As much as I wanted to love this game most of my deaths nowadays can be chalked up to somebody opening fire at me my game stuttering or freezing up completely and me getting obliterated. Unplayable as of now.i5 6600k 3.50GHz GTX1070 ROG Strix 8GB OC 16GB RAM
0;440 hours logged into the game and it's absolutly garbage hit registration is garbage you still die to stupid random stuff all the time. The amount of glitches are just crazy I wouldn't play this at all I will be selling off my pre order skins and cutting my loses
0;American servers are OVERRUN with ing Chinese hackers. Literally every single game has 50% Chinese speaking hackers that ruin the game. Get matched with randoms in squad and it's a Chinese guy 99% of the time that doesn't speak English and will probably team kill you for no reason.
0;This game was great at the beginning and the new patch fixed a lot but it's unplayable with the amount of hacking going on. Pretty much 9/10 deaths are by super obvious cheaters with full wall hacks aimbot whatever. Not recommended in its current state until a region lock or serious anti cheat is running.
0;Been playing this game for so many hours stopped counting...and they promised so much more improvements but its still unplayable. Desync is terrible people shoot me when they arent even peeking out of their cover.....i get hit even thou i ran into cover.DONT BUY it even Realm Royal is better...considering it just came out and PUBG is already 1 year old.
0;Joins game Waits for countdown in island Disconnects Waits AT LEAST 5 minutes to reconnect Reconnects and is already dead Decides to join another game Repeat steps above mentioned for infinite cringe and angerDefinitely NOT recommended for people with anger management
0;The worst problem in this game is that this game is infested with hackers and bluehole isnt doing anything about it. F**king aimbotters cant play for sh*t when their teammates get killed so they turn on wallhacks. Go play barbie dressup simulator at least there are no hackers. CHINA NUMBA ONE BlTCHES

0;I used to enjoy this game very much but now there are way too many hackers and there is way too little being done about it. I genuinely do not recommend this game because if you purchase it you will spend a lot of time finding gear and silently moving with your team and then bullets will hit you in the head that come from underground.
0;"""The Dev's couldnt give a stuff about the players they will do anything to get a quick buck. Their """"Fix PUBG"""" is a load of S**T OC Servers have been unplayable for 4 5 months and Their main concern is bringing out more maps/items ect. How about they fix the servers so we can even have a chance at getting on to play it without 120ms ping. DO NOT BUY"""
0;"The game's fun to play with friends unless you get put up against a streamer cause if you kill him nice and fair you're gonna get banned for ""Stream Sniping"" PlayerUnknown is a bit of a if I do say so myself BlueHole are money grabbing and the games riddled with server lag and response times are unless you have friends and you're up for a laugh then I don't recommend this game."
0;development has slowed to a halt also they nerfed loot rates and car spawns to basically make you search tirelessly for loot only to find out the circle is on the other side of the map and you will not find a car.BASICALLY A HUGE RUNNING SIMULATOR. ONLY WAY TO FIND A FIREFIGHT IS TO MAKE IT TO ATLEAST THE THIRD CIRCLE WHICH IS LIKE 15+MINS
0;The devs are too busy jerking each other off with the millions of dollars they made to actually listen to the people that bought their god forsaken game. Decided to make pubg mobile and add microtransactions to make even more money instead of focusing on supporting the playerbase. This game is dying don't waste your time.
0;Thought still there was hope but game as always and bluehole is only sucking chinese so I guess I'll just move to cod. I'm Korean and i really thought they would change the korean game industry but it turns out to be there are just a company with so poor capabilities .So sad
0;What's good about the game the game mode.What's bad about the game very bad netcode. The game has a tickrate of 8Hz. very bad optimisation. no restriction for china market like most steam games do. lots of cheaters nothing is being done to prevent obvious hacks such as speed hacks. inexperienced dev team no cheater report function in gameAnd many many more wrong things with the game. The only reason to play this game is because there's no other game that does battle royale better YET.
0;The developers are trash. all they do is focus on monetization. They charge 30$ for the game then 10$ for an event pass which is basically a copy of fortnite's battlepass. i mean i would understand if the game was f2p but jesus christ. All the while the game is still unoptimized. that was funny and understandable a year ago but it hasnt changed at all really and they call it a full release.. these guys threw away a great game with horrible horrible mismanagment that's just so ing blatant.
0;Do you like flippin with the 3 bike every 3 second?Do you like running in to chinese aimbots and dying in 0.1 seconds?Do you like it when the enemy can follow you nametag using scripts?Do you hate it when devs are solving bugs instead of creating new skins?Do you hate it when devs are nerfing the op wepons and buffing weak ones?Then this is the perfect game for you .
0;Dispite banning over 1mm cheaters its rare that you wont still be killed by one.Also content has stagnated. One new map and a few new items in its lifespan is not enough to keep the game relavent.I'm not the biggest fan of fortnight but at least they seem to be paying attention to their product. Might bite the bullet and make the switch.I cannot reccomend PUBG in its current state.
0;"""WORST F***ING TECHNICAL SUPPORT EVER WITH THE GODDAMN BROKEN GAME!Can't play 9 10 searched matches because of """"SOME KIND OF TECHNICAL ISSUES"""" &gt no answer for my ticket from official technical support FOR MONTHES!Too expensive for the thing that you wouldn't play."""
0;POS game. Read somewhere that they built the game on an engine that was never built to handle 100 live players. Whether It s true or not I can definitely see the effects.This is just the tip of the iceberg. haven t even got into hackers client server sync issues etc. The other 1000 s of negative reviews can go into that. There's only so many patches you can do to a 1977 Yugo. Comes time to just get a new car.
0;Honestly is now one of the worst games I have ever played. Everything about this game is just awful. Lag playerbase the movement the devs the glitches... The list goes on. I wish I had enough money to buy the rights to this game to delete it. Its that bad and I used to love this game.
0;Played a lot during early access and put up with the shocking performance. Didn't play nearly a year from last October to now and got a 1080ti/Ryzen 5 system since and it still runs terribly. Steam FPS counter even says 60fps but it definitely isn't. No matter what combination of settings I try it runs as bad as it did day 1.Controls have always been clunky and struggling with the dual aim/ads right click nonsense while losing so many frames make it impossible to enjoy.
0;Neverland of nope!I used to love this game in the early phase now it is just one of the biggest monuments in the graveyard of great concepts.A total technical failure in my opinion with terrible latency hitbox.If you are a fan of luck based games this is the perfect choice for you otherwise avoid it even at this price.
0;im only speaking on the SEA and ASIAN servers but there are so many cheaters it destroys the game reporting is like talking to a wall. even after all the updates there are more cheaters on now alot using map hack and recoil script. i would complain but bluehole doesnt care. so hellow next battle royal game this is a voice with 10 people who left pubg.
0;Product received for free. dont get me wrong the game is great but cheaters and bugs are everywhere. i meet cheater atleast 3/6 of my game and sometime ppl using bug as advantage video of ppl using bug https //www.youtube.com/watch?v wI8jSY8heE4&amp t 47svideo of a guy spay with ak no recoil https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 5BaL3A9xxmE
0;Good game. Played a lot. Lots of fun.Not anymore. Way to many hackers.Now PUBG corp has my money. I only bought one copy. Hackers buy many copies. Hackers get banned so they will buy a new copy. PUBG corp has a economic incentive not to fix the hacker problem on a permanant scale. Don't buy until they fix it permanatly.
0;The game just is unplayble and its really sad to see it go down this path. 135 000 players peak today and its just going to keep dropping. The devs are using the same engine that fortnite uses and it still has this amount of desync and server issues. Just pay for better servers and closer ones to the west coast. FPS is fine i get around 200 so thats not the issue.. PLEASE PUBG STOP MAKING SKINS AND JUST SPEND ALL YOUR MONEY ON SERVERS!!
0;WHAT A BAD game development team .......first u dont get good ping in ur region so you have to play on other servers and then now they have removed the region selection option so now i have to play on 250 ping and when i launch a compalin they dont do anything about it nice pubg
0;This game has so much potential but the developers dont care about the game or maybe they dont have the skill enough to optimize the game lots of bugs in this game and I can't play it on higher settings than low if I want a stable 60 FPS. My rig GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 CPU Intel core i5 6400KMemory 8GBWindows 10 (Home)
0;Over 400 hours in. Can't wait to uninstall and hopefully hang myself. Flash bangs crash game and steam or ruin frames Kar98 headshot on a dude with a baseball cap on doesn't die. Shotgun blasts to the face on a dude with no armor from 2 feet away doesn't die. Shot completely behind walls where no angle makes any sense at all. Dead. Play Donkey Kong Country instead.
0;Too many server issues. Servers drop EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. ON. SCHEDULE. Just spent the last 20 mintues trying to get a squad fo 4 going and we couldn't get a game together. Don't purchase the game until the publisher actually spends the money you put into it into stabalizing their server issues.
0;This game is absolutely terrible tons of bugs completely dependant on RNG and a ton of other t. And yet they decide to add weapon skins instead of fixing the damn game. DO NOT buy this game unless you want to cause yourself brain damage. 10/10 would refund it if I could.
0;Even if you're a fps veteran in this game the experience don't really apply here and the learning curve is quite high so be prepared for many many deaths before you finally get your first kill.Also if you have a potato pc accept the fact that you will almost certainly be killed if you land in high density areas because your textures don't load and you couldn't loot a building quick enough.
0;"""Crashes bugs poor performance and other issues are unforgivable considering the revenue and time they've had. I'd recommed this game if those things were fixed and the """"early access"""" guise was abandoned. Also release vaulting and new maps already."""
0;trying to be honest here cons bad graphics bad netcode semi bad physics lags ui feels like a bad app on an old tablet microtransactionspros ability to shoot people you can win a game wich makes u feel really good (adrenaline dopamin) you can play with friends wich could lead to fun and happiness or disgust and hate would not buy wolf tickets again.
0;Unpolished trash game. Spot an enemy without helmet shot him in the head with a kar98 still alive! Enemy sees me and kills me with one shot from pistol while wearing a helmet. There is no logic in this game! The description states that the release date was 23 March 2017. You got to be kidding!
0;THIS GAME BANNED ME PERMANENTLY FOR NO REASON. AND I WANT A REFUND. I DIDN'T EVEN USE A HACK OR ANYTHING. AND THE NEXT MORNING I GOT AN ALERT THAT I GOT PERMANENTLY BANNED BY THE DEVELOPER. I ALREADY PLAY THIS GAME FOR 943 HOURS AND GOT BANNED LIKE THIS.
0;Update Even with RTX 2080 the game is still trash fps under 100 with low settings .Update Still the worst game ever made.PROS NothingCONS Network Lag Detected Server too Busy 26Mb Update every Hour Weapon Damage is Random You hit but it wont count Loot Rng is broken Fall Damage is Broken Cheaters Everywhere (Some of them with flying cars)Better burn your money then buying this piece of junk.
0;"""3/4 games I'm killed by someone using an aimbot. Singles doubles or squads same results every single time. A good way of spotting this stuff is by looking at the name ASDFW hacker. ASLDW hacker.

0;Game play is absolute and their programming sucks. Horrible lag/rubber banding someone runs around a corner and you're dead before you even see them. Their net code is awful and they spend more time on getting you to give them more money with accessories and crates and crap than they do to make the gameplay work right.
0;I'm not one to write a negative review or a review in general but I hit my breaking point. This game should still be in beta. There is zero excuse for the current state of the game for the amount of money it has made. I tried giving pubg a chance to improve and it has let me down. If the shopping list of problems this game currently has are not resloved pubg is just going to be lost in the battle royale genre and get killed as #99 by some asian hacker or by a free to play fort building BR.
0;"""Updates coming out but no changes. Yea a new map dropped bla bla. In total the game is right where it started. But hey why not sell a broken game as """"early access"""" for 40 bucks. At least they worked on it to get it out of eary access. Now its not a completly broken early access game but a completly broken fully released game. Isnt that just great?"""
0;I used to play this game all day long it was so original and exciting to play but the company doens't listen to the fans i mean the servers are practically garbage i never imagined this day would come but thank god call of duty is almost out i feel sorry that this game will be forgotten because the dev's turned their attention to unimportant things
0;the games concept is good yet the game is so badly designed and programmed.my rig is mid to high end yet the performance is so unstable!!!!!!!!!i play 4k with midium to high settings without any problem but i can't get a stable performance on the lowest resolution and lowest graphics settings.some of the problems freeze when get shot fps drops during combat and large cities (po i ....) totally not recommended honestly
0;When you get awesome loot the game ofc crash and can not reconnet ing brutal game ......................... otherwise it s nice but stuff like this really killing it s fix this crap instead of ing skins and fix what ing matters........................
0;Terribly optimized and populated by chinese hackers. Probably better off playing Ring of Elysium for free as it's far more polished and enjoyable than PUBG. You'd think PUBG would try to improve their existing game but instead they keep releasing new maps with each one less optimized than the last.
