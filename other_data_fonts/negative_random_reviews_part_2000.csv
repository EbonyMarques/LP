0;Amount of bugs and glitches from error during launching to killers who consists of parts of other killers.11 invisible Hillbily with head of Micheal Myers/10 Nurses with head of Dwight and with Edward Scissorhands handsP.S.Dont believe?check out my screenshots
0;i would not recommend this.. this game used to be fun but they have fed and pandered so much to the survivors that it went from stealth and teammwork to... crouch in fron t of the a hook so the killer cant hook u got caught dont worry u have a garauntee get off his back got un hooked dont worry again when ur unhooked u cant be downed again... and if u wanna keep up with these rediculous changes you have to pay money to get a better killer..
0;Terrible game can't find lobbies more of a bug than a game no point in playing as a killer because survivors are overpowered and the servers are utter trash i usually have to play with around 200 ms which is not good compared to other games i get around 25ms in.
0;Terrible game! When you exit the game there is a chance of simply just losing rank! Community games are a nightmare! Russian players as usual will start to insult you in the chat Russian words some players start to squat once dumped a pallet! Just a disgusting game... That why i hate this game
0;I have played this game a ton. The concept is fun enough but there are some big outstanding issues. Trying to find a match is a nightmare. We've waited more than 20 minutes before giving up. If this was an early access title most of the problems could be forgiven. But it isn't. Friday the 13th The Game and Last Year is just a few months away and look a bit more promising.While I have definitely got my money's worth but until some of the big bugs are fixed I would recommend buying this on sale.
0;This game was fun until the Devs decided to nerf survivors over and over along with buffing a Killer that was already overpowered. Unless you can play with friends then this game is definitely not for you. What was a fun game has turned into a broken bug riddled and biased game that will eventually die good riddance. If I could get my money back I would and I never complain about games or write reviews.
0;"""Had a ton of fun with this game for awhile until they released Freddy. Freddy isnt only game shatteringly broken he completely drains all the fun out of the game absolutely refuse to play any survivor until they actually do something about Freddy. Instead of pretending the slight tweaks they did as a """"nerf"""". After weeks they still refuse to fix him. Would NOT recommend in it's current state."""
0;Loved the game at first one that I was really excited about but with newer updates it seems to just break the game. Literally wait 20 minutes just to play a game and then to be kicked out because there is a cheater detected or wait 20 minutes just for the game to crash. As I am writing this I am waiting 20 minutes just to get into a game please stop with the updates. As of right now I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone until the main issue of actually getting to play the game is fixed.
0;Dodgey and crap security is terrible loads of campers i report but dont get banned. That includes swearing farming and other abuses load of those idiotic people do. My word to anyone who wants to buy this garbage it is a waste of money. The devs should lower the price and highten the security because i have loads of people abusing me so i report them but dont get banned. The flippin vids aren't even game footage. (
0;Unbalanced game a lot of bugs the networking and matchmaking does not work you get kicked for no reason it freezes you disconnect the game just goes on when you close it. Overall it might be fun with friends if you get it on sale but that s about it. It also lacks broader gameplay as it s basically always the same procedure.
0;For few first games its fun till you start to notice everyone has all the most powerful perks.It doesnt even matter whether how skillful or not you are. Because you will get defeaten (survivor or killer) because you just cant do anything to assist teammates or to finish any players off.That said add a gamemode where perks are completely removed or just remove and remake at least 80% of the perks.Also looping is t bloodlust doesnt work game is unfair.
0;THIS IS NOT A REAL RELEASE BUT MORE LIKE AN ALPHA VERSION!If you wanna buy some alpha and to become a beta tester you are welcome. Otherwise stay away from this game. It crashes lags throws you out of lobby out of game etc. You lose your inventory items your points. It's simply completely unplayable.I REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PIECE OF GAME!
0;1. Killer who camps you2. It take 10 15 min to find a match because so many times people disconnect without a reason.3. So many who disconnect and you can't repair 5 generators in 2 people or alone.4. So many bugs but the developers can do DLC for 7$ because is a P2W because they don't make something good they just make killers and survivors to make money.5. I will regret all my life because I pay 20$ for this
0;This game is more like an alpha than a complete game. I've spent more time trying to get into games than actually playing. Even when I do finally find a lobby the killer just dodges without any penalty. But don't worry they brought out new outfits for the survivors! That shoudl help you get in a game with your BRAND NEW OUTFIT! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
0;Fun game does have a lot of strange bugs and cheaters but if you play with friends it's ok.They made it so easy for people to cheat on this game and the devs aren't doing anything to stop that except user reports and you have to record them doing it for it to even be taken seriously. Easy anti cheat is the biggest joke I ever heard. If they started to try to ban cheaters i'd recommend buying this game.
0;So what can I say about this game? The concept of the game is nice but implementation is poor. After releasing cosmetic DLC and the recent michael myers update the game still lacks dedicated servers. As for the balance of the current patch the trapper is incredibly frustrating to play against. The keybind to unhook and disarm are both on M1 leading to a scenario where you think you are disarming the trap and ending up getting stuck in the trap.
0;Good concept. I hope good developers actually take this concept and make a game. These guys have so many bugs. Took them 2 months to get it to where you could play with friends and another 2 before it actually worked. Then they released money grabs of clothing and an over powered killer.
0;dear god.......the queues for this game are absolutely horendous....this is no exaggeration.....i'll try to play as a killer and sit waiting for a group for over 5 minutes........ if i want to play as a survivor though i get a group in 3......... the queue times really need worked on or the player base expanded right now because the queues are so long its not even worth playing.
0;What happend Dead by daylight ?.This game is not fun anymore because of the BALANCED.Since Michael myers added in this game he is so op.This game supposed to be fun.For those of you cant handle angry issues DONT BUT THIS GAME.lot of campers.They just gonna hook you and wait until you DIE.I will not recommed this game until the game balanced again.I hope we can report camper in the furture.
0;The dev team have ruined this game. They keep pander to the killers way to much and the balance is heavily in the killers favour.Offically giving up this game and refuse to even stream this game anymore as its not something worth recommending.I would recommend against buying this game heavily.
0;Don't buy this game for killer the devs pretend to be listening but just do whatever they want. The public test build was for 3 days and didnt listen to any feedback. The favoritism for survivor is simply disgusting. They still never fixed SWF but hey at least u dont got to ready anymore. I wouldn't begin to know how many hours were spent searching for a game just for it to crash but hey at least you dont have to hit ready anymore ) . This is the makings of evolve stage 3 boys
0;"""Scooby Doo Simulator?Great game if ur planning on playing as a survivor.Game is supposed to be an assymetrical 4v1 where 1 is stronger than 4 but this isn't the case. If u play as a killer prepare to be mocked looped insulted in postgame chat by """"survive with friends"""". Killers are underpowered and some survivor perks are complety t. This game isn't an horror game at all I would say this game feels more like a scooby doo chapter than and horror movie."""
0;Unplayable laggy Since there is no dedicated servers this game not worth buying. As survivor you can wait for like 3 minutes for a lobby just to have a red/high yellow ping that makes the match unfair and unenjoyable and at the time you find and optimal lobby the killer most like dodges it for some reason because that's what happens (maybe they scared of fair non laggy matchup lol). Even on a sale you better to skip this videogame till they fix the BS.
0;The game it s self is nice but it is recommended 4gb graphics card is wrong. I went to my friends house he has a 1050ti (4gb) he can t even run this game on 60 FPS at lowest settings. I would only recommend this game if you have a good gpu. (Like me ) ) but the main issue is making this game unplayable for new survivors and making people like my friends rage quit. with the new killer (the clown) you haave no chance and over all they are making playing survivor almost unplayable
0;Just one thiing. if you dont enjoy the facecamp and be camp by any killer and trying to play fair. This its not your game. The Killer are the main thing for the devs and survivor one word. you are up!! Still its nice to get some laughs and feel like you still a newb in random gameplay.
0;This game is a piece of lagging and unbalanced game I don't recommend buying it because 90% lagging (to the point where it's literally unplayable because of the killer) matchmaking (rank 20's with rank 1's or matching you with someone from Korea when you live in Central Europe the classic ) )
0;The game needs a lot of doing up in my opinion. I find the game fun to play with friends but there are a lot of unfair parts to the game. The camping is unreal in it and ruins all the fun. Laggy as hell too. They need to improve the game instead of releasing DLCs. I recommend that if you get it wait until it is on sale.
0;"""If you want to create your own lobby as killer it's going to take 2 hours to get survivors if you want to play survivor get ready to be prompted with the error of """"Unable to reach game host"""". Haven't been able to play this game in months thanks devs )"""
0;amazing game! BUT...... for a game that is heavily advertised as a co op you dont have a good lobby system so friends can play together with other people? makes it very frustrating watching people come into lobbies then leave then come back in then leave over and over or when trying to find friends in a random lobby...... just wow.
0;"""Dead by Daylight aka Dead by T.w.a.t.s is a r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d game made by potato brains. It's full of kids and incompetent devs that instead of fixing their """"made by paint.exe"""" game bugs they ban you for them. There is an ocean of bugs like texture ones map bugs design bugs and a long etc.... but nah it's better to let the players """"swim"""" in those and instead of fixing them the devs penetrate their dirty d.i.c.k.s in your a.s.s."""
0;I ve played this game since it was released and I ve really like it but after a while I figured out that the producer are too much on the survivor side. Survivors are overpowered anyways and after that they buffed the killers then the survivors started crying and boom survivors are getting buffed.I am not playing this game anymore because I want to enjoy both sides killer and survivors.
0;Dead by Daylight used to be a great game I loved playing it at first.But since you can't find killer games nowadays the game is aids you get lucky if you find 4 survivors in an hour.I do not recommend buying this game the matchmaking is and they haven't fixed it in forever.
0;new chapter is great I also love the new mechanics involving hatch. though the aurel cells or whatever are ridiculous. would have to pay $5 just to buy a pair of cosmetic shorts for a character...this game seems like it is going more towards micro transactions. Will probably start playing soon since features like that completely ruin games for me. At least prior to this you could buy cosmetic sets and get many outfits for the same price I'd have to spend to get a pair of shorts.
0;I want to give this game a good review even tho I love this games concept but the community plays a big part of this games downfall. I only say that be'cause there is alot of people that are only face camping and it's only not fair but not fun the developers or however still don't have a balance system the killers have way more better perks than the survivors.Basically wait until the game goes on sale!!!
0;If U want the game to have a well balanced environment I hope ur group to think more about the feelings of new players. Such a simple and rough changes whether there's a transposition thinking about the feelings of a different player? and have U ever thought that every change would make an irreparable impact and loss on the whole and the part of the game?
0;"""This game was fun back in 2016. In 2017 the devs make poor decisions. In 2019 it turned into a flat out meme """"Hey guys lets just go ban people for no reason!"""". And by 2020 no fan base at all. ywEdit Literally reset my whole account and took away my dlc and skins great game 11/10"""
0;Do NOT purchase this game. BHVR delivers ZERO customer service. I bought the game and LOVED it for the three hours I was able to play it before an error with their anti cheat kicked me out of the game every time I launched it.Numerous threads e mails everything later and no response. Forum thread about multiple people suffering from the issue BHVR doesn't care. No customer support at all. The game is great fun but the company is junk. Spend your money on a better developer.
0;Spent nearly 250 hours getting my killers and survivors levels up All wasted because you can loose your savefile anytime and they are not able to recover it.Also this game is out of beta and still has countless bugs including game breaking ones.Don't recommend
0;The developers don't fix anything. When they do it takes them forever. They have even acknowledged in the past that they KNEW certain problems existed they just hoped no one would find them because it was hard to do.These devs want your money and that's it. Do yourself a favor just get Friday the 13th. Those devs actually care and you can even talk to them on their discord. Shocker I know! A dev team that listens to their fans actually draws a loyal fanbase.
0;"""Peer to peer connection in 2018 (so those greedy madafakers dont have to pay for servers). Grindfest of bloodpoints (to unlock meta perks that are also locked behind paywall and are a must if you want to actually get anywhere near to a reasonable rank). Bugs and crashes everywhere. Full of salty teen monkeys. Developers absolutely incompetent when it comes to balancing their steaming pile of shet that they call a game.""""Do you recommend this game?"""" Holy no no I dont."""
0;Would not recommend for new players playing killers is mindlessly easy and boring while playing survivor is not winnable. The DEVS will do everything in their power to make killers stronger and nerf survivors to the point of being unplayable. DEVS are actively sabotaging their own game not sure why but that's the way it goes.
0;Im changing my review since they have updated the killers. I still wouldn't recommend this game because I personally dislike the direction that this game is heading towards. There is so much dlc to this game that it starts to feel a bit like payday 2 in a way. It was a shame that payday 2 released so much dlc that it went double the price of what it was just by dlcs alone.
0;Fun but very buggy. All the bugs disconnections and frozen menu screens really take you out of the game. Not what I expect when I pay for a game... If it doesn't do what it's supposed to then it shouldn't be released. Please fix the broken game that we all payed for. Thanks!Update 1 year later... Can't even play the game... always crashes with no fixes available... thanks alot for the wasted money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!
0;A great game to play with friends unbelievably funny. That being said the game's netcode is completely ed and the matchmaking and gameplay is very unbalanced. DBDL also lacks a party system so playing online with your friends in a non private match isn't possible as of right now. This game needs a lot of work before it's worth any sort of money but the Devs seem dedicated and hopefully soon the game will be in playable shape.
0;This is a game for solo player. Can't even play with 4 friends. It takes like forever to find a lobby with 3 or 4 people. And now it contains tons of bugs that ruins the fun of the game. It should be called DEAD BY GLITCHES AND BUGS.p.s. now I can't even find a in lobby in solo survivor mode.
0;Awful game still full of bugs... Got to the end of the round and i froze right infront of the open gate and my character froze. I couldnt move and as the moster put me on the hook and i died but it kept me in the game. I had to leave the match and got none of the points i got for turning on mnost of the generators and opening up a gate. These guys arent fixing these horrific bugs SO DONT BUY WASTE OF $20.
0;A few updates ago the game completely messed up survive with friends to find a match. YOU CANT FIND A GAME WITH A FRIEND WITHIN 12 MINUTES OF SEARCHING.And also some games it disconnects survivors from the match saying the host disconnected but the host really didn't.
0;At this moment since I play this game for 3 4 week Seriously they needs to be fixed before it's enjoyable. Can't join lobbies half the time people trying to play with friends jump lobbies constantly. Game crashes at inoppurtune times anyway this game have alot of comfortable unique skill (perk) that would be make people enjoy in the gameAt last this game have a few bugs that they needs to fix it.
0;Play this game with four friends if you want to play lobby simulator. We never find a game with for people. We either have to be in a twos or a threes. This is a great game and fantastic concept behind it. However when you can't play with three of your other friends it's irritating. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Not until they finally do something about it.
0;I would love to give this game a great review but This game has crashed on my system 7 times while im in the middle of a great match. I'm running an i7 5820k and gtx 980Ti so I know system specs are not an issue. PLEASE FIX THIS game devs. You have a great title on your hands but this is a very bad problem.
0;Product received for free. WTF is goingon my game account just you got BUG by hacker and im pray of this ing poor security I just open the game and say hello push ok agreement THEN MY ACCOUNT IS RESTORE TO LV.1 WHAT HE F UCK I HAVE DONE ON THIS GAME ABOUT 150 HRS IS LOSE I GOT TO RESTART WITH LEVEL1 HOW SHOULD I DO CAN I SUE THIS LOSE I HOPE YOU REPLY ME OR GIVE ME THE ANSWER WHY THIS HAPPENNED IF NOT MY LOSE ITS WILL ACTAULLY IMPACT YOUR RATING GAME ON SOCIAL
0;listen this is a great game so fun i really well reccomed it but the only problem is it crashes all the time for me and its always mid game so i would definetily make sure ur computer is very well beacuse if not u can taek the risk i took and lag and crash
0;If you like sitting in a lobby more then playing the game then buy it. Match making is still broken... Adding new content to a game is all well and good but first make sure the basic features actually work. It's not a compatibility issue everyone is affected. Finding a match is a random game of who clicks at the right time. It can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 20 minutes.
0;Dont waste your money on this trash game. The creaters are stupid because they removed infinites and nerfed survivors. But the funny part is they still have not removed iron grasp or nerfed it and they still have not nerfed the killer so this game should be better because the killer is to overpowered
0;It is a very bad game because the killer have too much power.The developers didn t do something about it but they put new clothes for them.The servers are very bad because i enter with killer who have rank 1 and level 46 and i have lvl 31 and rank 20.This game is not accurate and i hate it.
0;While the game has improved over the years.It has taken a turn down recently.As a killer it takes between 20 30 minutes to get a game together.A new DLC with game breaking machanics is released every few months.The 2018 Haloween event is nothing but more of a cash grab.the developers have taken the EA / Activision business model of screwing its gamers over and over by forcing them to keep buying the latest DLC or be left behind.This is how good games fail due to greed.
0;This game has so much potential but it feels like an unfinished game. Its riddled with bugs connectivity issues and people. If you are thinking of purchasing the game I suggest you wait. The developers need to address the weird balancing issues the lack of a party system the strange survivor/killer rank system and the lack of consequences for people who DC early to avoid giving the killer points. Give this game a few months before you buy it unless you have 4 or 5 friends you can play with.
0;it just a rubish when zhe last patch come out. The survivor cant be safe when they are seen by hunter.The widen terrain can beat all of the survivors with less wood and window.And the hunters also can use cheater(waller) kill all the survivors so easy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;Gameplay ok except for window vault abusement. Balance is fine. Little to no settings tho no keybind menu.Lobbies are bugged game freezes randomly in menu for 10 40 seconds. No party system despite promises.Played 32 hours of beta had tons of fun thought the 1.0 version will be a finished product it is still feeling like beta.Don't buy... yet.
0;Do NOT I repeat NOT buy this game until you see in the news feed that the devs have fixed the progress rest bug. Its absolutly unexcusable how they let that slip and focus on 'adding more content'. DayZ made VERY similar mistakes and that is now just a cash cow game that the devs just flat out ignore the real issues. This game seems to be no different. PS Dog community.
0;Good game. really fun. Except when you get in a game where its laggy as hell and u just jump around while running. You get stuck on walls when you tried to turn and end up dying..... fix that and there will be a better review have a way to vote out for the lag on the game... so stupid i lost ranks cus of that
0;Great game but Freddy is impossible to beat. I advise that either he lose the ability to see you outside his terror radius or that he have to be within 5 metres for 10 seconds to drag you into the dream world and be only as fast as the survivors. If this isn t done I will not play online anymore and will advise against the purchase of this game
0;The devs are just ruining this game they dont understand their own game and the balance is way off and they keep pushing it in the wrong direction. They dont listen to the community dont fix important this but rather give us more needles shi*. And also the recent BAN wagon jesuschrist banning people for no reason at all and letting the hacking youtubers keep playing what are they doing.
0;The game still has the issues it has had for the past 6 months. The developers are clearly cash grabbing with cosmetic DLC and they don't care for the games longevity. Only buy this game if you like giving money to developers who refuse to start dedicated servers and making the game's name relevent.
0;This game is a steaming pile of should have done more research on it before spending the money for it. The devs are a ing joke the forum is run by ing idiots and the game is so toxic you get cancer and die the moment you double click it to start the mother er...Don't buy this piece of it will only bring you pain with devs that don't give a about you and forum mods that act like children... The game is craptastic. Watch what you say on the forums as the devs will ban you for no reason.
0;Worst game of 2016+3 k bugsposts after one month(characters get stuck in middle of map ragdolls through hiding spots no keybinds Qte programmed badly random lags matchmaking broken textures not loading leveling system broken ...And instead of fixes they put in more bugged content and ignore all the broken mess they created.Devs beyond incompetent. Will never touch any of their products ever again.
0;The Devs are completely out of touch with how to balance their game. Negative review based on what was said on the stream as well as based on the nerfs they keep throwing to killers while unnecessarily buffing survivors.The game should be hard for survivors. Not comfortable. Get your heads out of your asses.
0;WHY DID YOU BAN ME IDOITS I DID NOTHING BUT LEVEL UP SO GIVE ME A BETTER REASON TO BAN ME NEXT TIME CAUSE I DID NOTHING!I LIKED THIS GAME SO DAMN MUCHTHEN YOU HAD TO BAD MY GAME!?!?!?!?IM SORRY IF I DID SOMTHING ONLY 1 BAD THING THAT I DID AND YOU BANNED ME FRICK YOU
0;dont buy this game just dont buy ur self ice cream or something. like this games idea is very nice but the codders are af and this game cares only about money i mean it has ton of bugs for example u can fall out of the map if killer leave u lose item and offering.... well thats ur choice to buy or not to buy this game but i promise u wont be any happier with this game bought
0;"""This game is not worth the bacteria growing on horse If you want a good game go to Friday the 13th unlike the fat trash that owns this piece of they care about their game. DO NOT BUY THIS OR YOU ARE ING ! Would I recommend this? Well I recommend this as much as a I recommend a reality tv """"star"""" needs to be president so NOOOOOOOOOO!"""
0;Day 1 and a lot of server bugs. Give it time to see if they fix the lobbies and dropped connections (right now getting a game going is terrible) and add in some quality of life improvements like muting the lobby music and I might change my review. Until then meh.EDIT Almost a year later. Logged in to see what has changed. Lobbies still suck. Survivors still trolling killers until they DC. Lobby music still annoying AF. Uninstalled. Guess I'll give it another year.
0;I DO NOT recommend this to anyone without a VPN. i played one game as killer and then at the end of the game this player ( http //steamcommunity.com/id/churrothief ) Docs'd me. He gave out my home address and IP. This is just a clear example of a very unsecure game. Sorry but it kinda ruined my experience with the game.
0;Wouldn't bother getting too much into this game. Its been over a year and the glitch where all your progress instantly gets wiped out is still around. Unless you do daily backups your playing Russian Roulette every time you play. Got all of my progress wiped so I'm done with this.
0;Game does not support 21 9 aspect ratios in any way! If you own a 21 9 monitor and wish to make use of it do not buy this game!That being said the game itself is quite fun and can be very satisfying. It's a real a shame that the devs refuse to put in the effort to support ultrawide aspect ratios.
0;YOUR GAME IS ING 1HRS I CAN PLAY JUST ING ONE GAME GO DOING WHY YOU DON'T ING FIX YOUR ING IDIOT SERVER ZONE WELL CAN YOU GET MY ING MONEY BACK ? YOUR GAME IS ING PIECE OF I'M SO DONE THIS ING GAME PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR? ING IDIOT ALOT OF WORDS GO FIX IT AND GIVE BACK MY ING 19.99$ ING DUMBASS
0;Too many people using lag switches camping downed players or camping hooks pay to win killers. The pig makes no sense being a human the goal of the saw movies wasn't to hunt and kill people. make it so the killers that can go invisible are easier to see they're already pay to win. If a killer camps give them some sort of penalty like 50% movement speed for 30 seconds.FIX YOUR ING BROKEN GAME THAT CRASHES EVERY ING DAY.
0;Ranked games are unplayable people keep ragequitting without being punished. MM is broken. Peer to peer connection so if the host is downloading porn you basically can't play. With all the money they got from selling this game they should do more then something about these problems i'm disappointed.You can have a lot of fun with friends that's the only way you can enjoy the game.Looks like this game is still in beta but the major problem is the community totally sucks.
0;this is a so much cancer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and i have tumors that i can feel on my back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!they are not creators of good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i uninstall this because 1.the killer is ing invisibile 2.the event is bugged!!!!!!!!!this is not okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it doesn t deserve twenty euros!
0;Best Lobby Simulator 2017 !Just try to join with any of your friends and enjoy the 30 minutes delay before having a 50% chance to join a game !Now features 5 minutes of additional waiting on any lobby !For the devs Please enhance the match finder it's definitely ruining everyone's experience on the game. The more people quit this game the harder it is to find games...
0;Every game I have played has been a farm fest where killer never leaves hook sight. Anyone who comes to save me or anyone else is ignored and the injured person is Immediately put into a dying state and returned to the hook until they are eliminated from the game. Rinse and repeat very sad for a game I loved in the beginning and is now just stale. I don't know how is it for higher level play but I can't sit throught the hook camping and farming. Hope one day it is better &lt 3.
0;"""Just a short review because 80% already know it this game is really bad even after these years lobby system and ingame mechanics are just awful after every single big """"update"""" there are more bugs in this """"update"""" than ingame content itself (I am not talking about the unbalace in this game after every patch/update)The only reason why i am playing this game is just to annoy some players and be an to everyone and just have fun with friends."""
0;many glitch the first game i got stuck inside a hook the killer can't get me but i cant move too so the killer leftafter the shape update every killer become shape and still many bug i keep crashing this time i got stuck on the killer's arm i cant move but the killer cant get me too so the killer left.......again this game 10/10
0;It was a pretty neat game until they brought out leather face. He just mowed down three people at once. If that is not OP I don't know what is. There is no evading him. There are also videos on youtube of Leather Face just chainsawing 4 people at once. Not worth the $$ anymore until they nerf it.
0;Dear creators of this game For the first time in Dead By Daylight I found a purple flashlight and escaped with it. It even displayed me holding the flashlight while I was running away in the animation. Sadly enough this item glitched probably afterwords and did not make it to my inventory. I don't know if this will reach anyone related to the game but I would truly like to receive my purple flashlight. Thanks for listening. If you did so.
0;I like the game but I crash everytime I play this game. (2017)Ok! I am really starting to like this game a lot now. I rarely crash in game and for the most part I have a nice playable experience overall. The only problem now is the Chinese players in NA servers. Its getting to the point now that i can't even connect to the game anymore.
0;Gonna change this up althrough i am not happy in any point with killers/surviours DLCs the game is getting better and i mean it community is not that bad as it was before (Still tons of campers) there is a lot too come and i'm happy they do free updates because i'm not whilling to spend another trillion like i did with PAYDAY.
0;"""Its the worst thing you can imagine since its a """"fun"""" game to play with ur friends yet in a few hours in the game you can lose everything u grind for it . Not only talking from me but lots of persons lots their data because of the game it self so i don't recommend buying this game not only for the data but for the bugs the killers are the server etc etc . for a game that have more then 1 year its pretty bad"""
0;Terrilbe game. I played survivor got rank 10 play 5 games was back and fourth. then 5 games in a row got camped then after I started tilting i took a break I played another game and took 10 minutes to find a game that was 3v1 and got cammped the whole game again. I took another break and tried one more time and play a FREAKING 1v1 !!! THAT IS THE DUMMBEST EVER! you guys could fix this game so easily man ! but you guys are lazy and dont want to fix it! that
0;I enjoy this game a lot but thats provided I am actually playing it. Queue times are extremely terrible and if your playing with friends its never gonna happen. Might be a lack of killer lobby but at this current moment. Its best not to go ahead with the purchase.
0;It's basically become a collection game on rails because the perks nullify the basic stategy and mechanics of the game. It's pretty boring once you play it for a couple days. You literally just take turns 'saving' players off of a hook until its your turn. As killer you just run around and grab the guy who just got off the hook hook them again and run to the nearest player you see. Used to be good but overpowered perks make it not worth playing.
0;"""Don't buy this game even if it goes down to 1$. Still waste of money. Killers camp and tunnel the out of you even in the high ranks. Devs are actually encouraging it. People gonna trashtalk you like """"Don't get caught if you don't wanna get camped"""" or whatever. There are killers you can't outrun. If you start playing this game don't play survivor. Since I'll be doing the same as the other untalented killers do. Catch one and face camp the out of him."""
0;If you want a laggy buggy unbalanced game.This is what you are searching for.Killer oriented waste of money will tear your nerves as you realise how ed up the devs are with each patch.Bunch of high school teens decided to make a game ed up and here you go.DO NOT i repeat DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GAME UNLESS IT IS DISCOUNTEDEdit This game never changes always favoring killers. t ''balance''. Devs do ''pretty good job''.Classic 4v1 game.
0;F*ck this i tell u! with each new killer the killers get stronger and stronger! each survivor perk is debuffed. Look at Sabotage 3 the survivors could manipulate the hooks completely but now nooo. All survivor perks are t while killer perks are op... F this game...
0;So this is a great game and all. But you really need to penalize the people who face camp hooked survivors. Like what is the point of a game that everytime someone is hooked you cant be rescued because the killer just trolls the area around you. Should make it so people who dont leave heart beat radius of a hooker survivor cant play killer for so many hours. Lack of penalizing people is what creates this toxic game you have atm.
0;SoooooI really can't recommend the game in the state it is in right now.This game was semi balanced quite a while ago after which BHVR decided to destroy said balance yet again.Now I do understand that it is really hard to balance a game like this. And I am also not saying that people cannot have fun playing it. Don't get me wrong it IS fun to play. But the more you play it the more you see the annoying changes the devs made to it.Overall atm it's just zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
0;New player experience is trash Balancing is trash (try nurse or spirit) Resetting your rank to farm newbies experiencing the trashy new player experience is trash Lag is trash (nice killer hosts game and gets to decide the latency? epic!) New skins are being added constantly nobody cares about the gameplay though Please buy half of the new killer after buying the chapter
0;losttt alll of my progress withinnn 24 hours of gaming ( if u plan to play long in this gamei dont recomend to do so cuz ullll just lostt all ur progress just like meeeplss try to fix thiss.... i've invested over 5 million bloodpoints (not easy to gather)just lostt within a blink of an eye
0;Its a cool game and i have spend lots of time on it but recently every match takes between 10 30 or even craz after the long waiting periode. They said it would be fixed but nothing happens.When u spend money on something you want it to work and this game doesnt (
0;At this stage I cannot recommend this game.DEVs are moving extremely slow. Either they are one of the following incompetent lazy or just not caring. It's been a year now since the release and they did almost nothing except empty promises.So many bugs still not fixed...
0;Product received for free. It really is a great game. The gameplay is fun as both killer and survivor but the community is terrible. I don't think I can play as killer anymore because of the tea bagging flashlight clicking and all the other forms of mockery I have to endure just to have some fun. It is the worst gaming community I have come into contact with so far.
0;Game sucks community is devs are dumb s who throw out cosmetics to make people stick around to play their unbalanced unfun game killers try super hard and play super toxic and survivors only play 2x 4x swf from ranks 1 10 the community make it a point to play like boys to ruin everyones day just because their lives are and good for nothing. dont waste your time or money on this tier game!
0;Cant figure out why I paid for this in the first place now. Devs refuse to properly address campers and infiniters without punishing everyone in the game. The game used to be so much fun then they started messing around with crap they shouldn't have. this game could be big its only popular right now because of the disapointment from friday the 13th. It'll drop down back down again in no time and then itll be too late for them to save this game.
0;I would gladly suggest this game to anyone who enjoys wanting to rip their own eyes out through their ing if you're ready to rage more than a feminist that got told that a guys name is humongous than please download this game. Killers will find anyway to complain about how survivors are op and survivors will find anyway to complain about flashlights being nerfed. Ladies and gentlemen welcome to dead by MY LIFE light
0;Got this on sale for about $10 as a buddy recommended it. The game was fun for a bit but It feels unfinished. Very buggy. Games often fail to connect or the game just freezes. Community is also a little toxic at times...though the bugginess is far worse. Avoid.
0;"""GARBAGE. TRASH. POORLY CODED GAME. CRASHS AS MUCH AS IT RUNS. DEV'S PUSH OUT NEW DLC (PAY TO WIN) KILLERS BEFORE BALLANCE OLD ONES IN AN ATTEMPT TO MILK THE """"USEFUL IDIOTS"""" OF THER $$$.YOU ARE BETTER OFF HUFFING PAINT THAN PLAYING THIS PIECE OF TRASH.IT MAY HAVE BEEN A NICE IDEA BUT IT IS FAILED GARBAGE AND THE ONLY PEOPLE CALLING IT GOOD ARE JUST TRYING TO JUSTIFY THEIR TIME AND $$$ SPENT ON IT."""
0;I would recommend this game but I can't at this current time. Fun game honestly but the game errors and glitches are as frequent as a free to play game and thats not okay. I play a couple of free multiplayer games and some have better servers than this one. It's a bit disappointing? Game creators need to fix their servers and patches otherwise people will be turned off.
0;I loved this game when I first tried it. It has turned into a horrible toxic environment that favors the killer every time. I have truely loved playing this game but until something changes with the abilities of the killers I just don't think it is something I will enjoy playing.
0;Product received for free. This is the stupidest ing game I've ever played in my life. The matchmaking system is wack and the hitboxes on everything are broken. Good survivors against noob killers and good killers against noob survivors. How does that make ANY ing sense? Don't buy this game.
0;Most of my hours are idled I haven't ever really played this game. So I'm doing the tutorial today playing as killer on the third or fourth tutorial bug where I'm stuck in a tree and can't move. Can't restart keyboard working fine I have to exit the tutorial now I must start from the beginning yeah bye uninstalled.Also there are barely any graphical options and the stupid game is capped at 60fps? I have a 144hz screen that's useless to me. Why the hell is this stupid game so popular?
0;It's a crying shame that the devs of this game can't stand up to the survivor community turning what could be one of the greatist game of its kind into well....this. The devs let exploits run while just to appease the survivor community. So if you are looking for a balanced game look elsewhere.
0;Good game but the new Freddy DLC ruins it for both sides killer and survivor. Killers dont want to be in an infinite pallet loop and survivors want a chance to escape a killer. But with freddy you have neither The only thing a survivor can do is Pallet loop and by the odd chance you actually lose the guy when he moves away and you're outside his terror radius he once again knows exactly where you are
0;new patch Freddy DLC was RUIN the game already you destroyed the system of game with it ing Freddy is too cheat killer with any skills like block the gate windwalk all the time his body is like the wind that can walk though including drag survivor to the dream. oh damn what are you thinking? made the cheating Killer like that!?!?What happen if everybody play it.....baammm on one play it anymore....
0;This is my favorite game but they keep screwing over survivors. It seems like every update the survivors get fewer points and the killers get more. Most games the killer has at least 2 3x the points. I don't understand it. The devs need more survivors than killers but they treat the survivors like crap.Points are free devs... let us have some.
0;An alright game at first. the odd bit of fear every now and then. Very boring after though. it's the same thing over and over. repair a gen simulator would be a better fitting name. There are much better games out there with similar concepts such as White Noise 2 and Friday the 13th. If you are thinking of buying this and putting lots of hours into it... don't. The games i mentioned earlier are much better picks.
0;This game used to be good and i put money into it...now it sucks with the s you get to play with....game itself is great it only takes few people to totally ruin it for the players being killers or survivors on there own.. in the end LOSERS cant look after themselves they need someone else for backup..Games good to many tools playing it.
0;ok please fix this game like really. i enjoy playing this but since you added this new matchmatching system i cant join with friends or alone so if you want this game to sit in a lobby and never find a game! this is for you!!!! but it is a good game overall when you dont go from having young balls to old dusty balls waiting on a game
0;Used to love to play this game with my friends but now?What you're gonna see now mostly is either killers camping the hooks ALL the time or survivors flashlighting you to death as a killer.What makes it worse all of those are approved by the developer and not a bannable offense.If you want to experience what I just wrote buy this game.Otherwise spend that money on something more fun.
0;Ranking system is buggy I am facing an issue where everytime I escape using the hatch i derank first of all ranking up is a ing pain in this game and now this is totally ruining the game for me . I will give it a thumbs up once the devs fix this bug .
0;When i first bought this game one year ago it was a fun game where you actually had to figure out if the killer has any totems now its only based on farming points creating more killers not fixing bugs and overall not teambased anymore as it was. Since it tells you everything why doesnt it tell you who the killer is too when you start the game??
0;Still so many bugs and disconnection errors. I don't understand what the developers are doing. They are supposed to fix them first and then make more contents. However they just try to get more players with this poor game. If you consider about buying this game don't do that and go to play Overwatch.
0;UPDATE Thanks to the new killer this game is absolutely impossible to play as survivor. If things were bad before now they are appalling. I'm leaving this game to die.In a few words Camper killers make this game awful to play.And the saddest part is that the developers could fix by discouraging camping but they don't seem to care.
0;right now this game is broken not even mechanic wise just game wise the updates always break the game so u have to reinstall easy anticheat and what not and verify files unless they actually patch this crap i wouldnt reccomend it right now feels like the devs just gave up on fixing the bugs
0;A lot of bugs i do not recommend buying it cause the developers make it worse and worse by every update. I tought to myself i will ignore the bugs and stuff but this game is WAYYYYY more terrible by every update comming . If you consider playing it with a mate be ready to wait for 3 years .
0;The game can be fun but the Devs need to do something about Killers facecamping survivors when they are on the hook. There needs to be some sort of penalty for that just. If a survivor hides all game crows caw and circle. A killer can camp a hooked survivor the entire time and have no penalty whatsoever. Overall good game but definitely needs some tweeks.
0;One step forward and two steps back. Game was working great for a while now it seems like I cannot join a game without one or two people disconnecting. I've been kicked from a few games myself before the match starts. Needs work on connection stability or at a minimum if someone gets kicked off the game should adjust the number of generators required to escape. Come on devs you're better than this.
0;Good game the developers are f*cking stupid. They give us DLCS instead of fixing game breaking bugs that cost many players such as myself to get completely reset back to level 0... ON EVER F*CKING CHARACTER. People grind countless hours on this game and the fact that you can get reset at any moment is bullsh*t. Would not recommend buying until the devs fix their sh*tty game...
0;Honestly the game is great and amazing fun to play with a group of friends.The developers don't seem to put any real effort into keeping the community in check and it's full of really toxic players and cheaters. If they finally focus on how incredibly miserable their online experience is I would recommend but not now.
0;I think the game loses much of its value when it stops being scary. At about 10 hrs of gameplay you can see the flaws come out. While there is nothing with this type of gameplay out there on the market I feel like the game is a long way from its potential. Bugs glitches salt toxic community if you like this game you're not looking at the comment section. Stay away
0;really used to love playing the game but seeing the path its gone really saddens me. still buggy as ever and all these pay to play killers are bs running hiding and juking is almost useless against some killers such as the doctor and freddy kruegar which ruins part of the game. truly disappointed in what has happened to this once enjoyable game.
0;This game is great sometimes sad when u got camped by killer ... but its not that bad as new season. On every new season experienced players play with newbies and destroy game ... Also why the l cant instal new updates like last one with 18mb l had to reinstal the game to play it Fix pls
0;This is a really big hit and miss game. It has so much potential and its almost extremely fun to play. imo there is a huge balancing issue. Its too easy to die as a survivor. Obviously its possible to win but unlikely. I've been playing this all weekend during the free to play weekend period. I would buy this game if it was actually fixed. However being that it was released back in 2016 this doesn't appear likely. (
0;The game is actually really fun!!! But you shouldn't get it until they either remove leatherface or nerf him severely. I really liked the game before. Whoever plays leatherface should probably hang themselves. Screw you game devs for making such a broken game. Finally the other killers are also lame. Such as... hag michael myers wraith (yes I know he's easy to avoid but still my 4th least killer to play against) doctor freddy boy and the pig. In fact I don't like any of the newer killers.
0;The games good but if you're trying to play in the EU region good luck with finding a game where the killer doesn't teleport around because of the high ping he has. Honestly makes the game real and almost unplayable. Wouldn't buy the game if you're going to play as a survivor. Also for what I've seen 2/3 matches has a killer that camps the hooked survivors. Hf.
0;the idea behind the game is pretty good. It is just that the wrong developers are carrying it out. this game will die pretty soon i guess. Anyway if you are like crazy rich and actually wanna pay money for this game. go ahead give it a shot. But i am pretty sure that you are gonna be pretty disapointed by the end result. just keep in mind to not play it for over 2 hours so that you can still refund it after.
0;Devs are terrible dont jump into it. Garbage servers devs do not care for survivors. It's community is dying already it's not really worth getting into when devs only care for 1 party and having a small community. The game in vanilla was amazing now its just hot garbage with all these updates.
0;wiggle speed is to slow hooks are way to close to eath other hunters are running to fast (hillbilly can do a 180 degree turn with his chainsaw) when you destroy the hooks the just come back after a few minutes jumping through windows and pulling down pallets is laggy and to slow cause the killer is gonna hit you anyway so no i do not recommend this game.
0;GIve it atleast 5 more years and maybe you wont get stuck in a tree every third game all your perks will work like they are supposed to you wont have problems with finding a game and there are much much more bugs but instead of fixing them they focus on releasing DLCs with even more bugs to make more money. Its an awesome game and i love it but sometimes the bugs just get the best of you.
0;Don't recomment to buy full prince. This game is buggy 30% of time when I join lobby I stuck on loading screen. Event Thingies become useless after event ends and wasted bloodpoints what you can't ignore or go way around them.Unbalanced matchmaking. Lazy devs are lazy.
0;This game is horribly stacked against the killers. Hopefully they improve it.To say nothing of having had all progress wiped and now having waited over a month for some sort of fix.Don't waste your money or your time until they make the killers actually scary again. Otherwise it's a pushover for the survivors.
0;It's a nice graphic and nice story game. I played it more than 100 hr. Anyway more than half of game I foundmany bugs than can made me die. For example you can't heal yourself you can't use item you have you can't cross the window. The match making is very terrify. It use more than 10 min for multiplayer to find match.
0;This game is good but still has a lot of bugs I would like fixed.1. When I have stopped healing as i get a skill check noise and i stab myself2. I have dodged around a tree and he lunged the whole way around a tree to hit me3. The way pallets work4. there should be a way for all everyone to play more sportsman like. Most of the community are toxic and it there should be a way to punish people who are toxic
0;The killers are hitting me 3 meters away from pallets or vaults. Then they stand next to me while on the hook or they leave me on the ground when I am obsession and follow me. Then when I decide to leave games like this I receive ban.. Who is destroying the kame more? Leaver or the stupid player? I think it is company itself who is destroying this game. GG GL
0;ranked system in a non skill game. all they do is nerf survivors forcing me to become a killer main. not even worth playing survivor anymore.Update Still playing this game with friends. If you have friends you'll enjoy it. If not play killer only. Make sure to the leave the lobby after killing the survivors before they can type a message to you about how of a killer you are for killing all 4 of them.
0;The more I play the more I hate this game. Theirs Game Designers are so ing bad they getting their money for nothing.Why I cant invite friend after match when I played with him? I should exit to main menu and than enter to special friends lobby (User friendly interface yea). Why I get rank when killer ragequit at start match? Why when you play as nurse you can see backface culled geometry while jumping? Are you ing serious?
0;I understand now why this game has the horror survival tag.Basically the killers are afraid of the survivors and they try to survive to not press the magical uninstall button or the definitive delete the game button in the steam support section.2/10 Would get looped again. See ya in Last Year The Nightmare a more balanced game with better community than dead by toxicity
0;game now devs ruined it. Basically noob killers have been complaining for ages to get some buffs even though it wasn't necessary since good killers like truetalent were doing perfectly fine. The devs listened and nerfed the crap out of survivors. RIP Dead by Daylight was good while it lasted.
0;The game is good IF you can get past the connection issues server lag killer being invisible sometimes and the occasional cant click on anything at all. After the November update i had nothing but problems. play 6 games 2 or 3 will have an invisible killer. the rest run fine. and yes my pc specs are more then the recomended for this game....
0;300+ hours played this game.Best MP game ever better than CS GO and other game which have much cheaters.So much good teammates and good killer who have respect for surivors.In one hand horror in other hand survival game best connection between genres.But I am banned.Cancer game with cancer players!!
0;The game is great but I have a common problem where the killer will leave and I lose my rank. If this was a rare thing it wouldn't bother me but this is very common where killer's lag out or just simply leave the game. This makes you lose your rank and gives you less bloodpoints. Please fix this.
0;"""This game is not what it's advertising itself to be. """"A feast for killers"""" my There are only four killers in this game that aren't complete clowns in high level play. If you bought this game with the hope of striking fear into the hearts of survivors you play against prepare to be disappointed. However if your goal is to genrush loop and just all over the killer's day then this game is just for you. Otherwise your time is most certainly better spent elsewhere."""
0;This game is very good and very fun but if you play against Russian killer can be very bad from my experience they are the worst they will camp you and tunnel as long as they can survivors tho will leave you and never go for save. And this game crashes a lot i mean a lot from my experinece i have over 300 games bf4 in worst days didn't crash like this one and this one is over 2 years out
0;"""Was fun at first but after some time devs decided to """"balance"""" the game. Well. Yeah. Balance. It may be hard in game like this where it is 4 vs 1 but hooks and beartraps respawning after 3 minutes is kinda... Too fast? There are perks that allow killer to haul survivors whole map... Something what would be cool is if killer had to manually repair hooks when theyre destroyed.And one more thing. Killers like The Doctor. You just walk around and survivors scream. Too OP."""
0;I got banned because two survive with friends didn't see me do a generator. I was hooked and they did 3 generators and by the time a healed myself they did the 4th one and I couldn't find the last one. When I found it I finished it and I broke the killers hex totem but they didn't see any of that so they just said report him report him. I thought this game was the best but I don't know anymore
0;Thanks for the patches really...nevermind that the camping is still not punished...nevermind that the game is crashing like and nevermind that i loose my player levels because of this ing annoying crashing....oh and finding a match takes about half an hour but yeah...the game could be fun if everything is working like 10/1 times. Thanks!!!
0;I recommend this game still I say 'No' to get some attention. Lately the developers have been pushing their luck as they motivate survivors only to gain blood points and let themself get killed. ( It would help a lot better if survivors only get their blood points if they survived the round if you ask me.254+ hours of game play and slowly coming to an end now.
0;this latest update has ruined the game. the game was for the most part balanced before but now it is exponentially harder almost impossible for survivors. dear developers if you force us to disarm traps before getting people off hooks PRIORITIZE THE TRAPS when it comes to pressing buttons... respectfully every DbD fan that use to love the game
0;Definition of pay to win.Multiple Killers that are locked behind DLC and multiple survivors locked behind DLC. Locking gameplay behind a pay wall is pay to win. Oh also the game is an unbalanced joke and has been since day 1 The idiots making this game don't deserve your money lol
0;Absolutely hate this game the game mechanics sucks the devs are stupid and WHY THE HELL IS CAMPING A TACTIC?! the killers are all to tryhards the teams are sometimes i would rather play Friday the 13th than playing this crap. If i would recommend this game atleast they can do is make the ga e FAIR enough. But sadly i'm going to give it a not recommended game. Don't waste your money on this game.
0;All the developers had to do before 1.0.4 is to fix remaining bugs. Not only some of them haven't been fixed yet but within the newest update the gameplay has been ruined and the only cool thing about the recent update is new outfit but that's it. Totally imbalanced and not worth playing anymore.In the current state I don't recommend this game to anyone. Uninstalling and rating negative.
0;Currently Killers are too over powered and there needs to be some serious balancing. It's almost just stupid how powerful killers have become (I've been playing since release) they have way too many perks and what not that make them unfair and just straight up too powerful. Currently I do not recommend but I will fully support this game if some balances happen.
0;Devs Go yourself because i have 400 hours on this game and i bought a deluxe edition so my problem is you make super op killers and i lost al my level and bloodpoints and i haved almost all survivors prestige 1 but no you we just want you to play again the game like you're a begginer somone can help me? If somone can i rlly remmend this game but i dont want to make my level again YOU!!!
0;"""Great game HOWEVER do NOT spend money on killers. You will only be able to play about 2 games as a killer as you will constantly receive a """"No network connection"""" error every single time. If you want to play survivor it will work 100%. Playing as survivor every single time gets repetitive and draws me away from the game."""
0;Whats wrong with this game...!! the matchaking is so broken..!! i am a rank 20 killer and always get me with rank 1 5 survivors..!! ffs. and when i am the survivor always it give me a rank 1 5 killer.. even if i am 15 20..!?!?! wtf fix the stupid rank system ffs..!! thats why everyone use speedhacks and wallhacks..!!! this game is so broken by itself..!!
0;Our happiness comes from the intense competitation between the killers and survivors not from hiding and repairing the machine. However it seems that the game maker doesn't know it or just neglect it. It was a good game but it is not now. That's why I write this comment here.
0;When i play as a killer.it usually shows me that 5 survivors are in the game then my game crash. what the hell is this?I sent the report bug like 10 times and it still crash after many minor patch.When do you really gonna fix this? It really me off.I have lost many pips due to this kinda of crash.
0;This game is enjoyable and fun to play in overall exccept the fact that the community is toxic and unfriendly. Addition to that this game has frequent update that took like 1000 years to finish up. It will always stopped at 100% and will take so long to finish.
0;Worse ever ! Developer keep changing !! Killer movement speed it too fast for Survivor ! Causing early game end within a minutes espeically these killer with chain saw. 20 Dollar is a jokeeeeePlayer who work hard to climb rank ! Serveer Diconnecrt Player without notice causing rank drop .
0;I do not reccomend this game. For a long period I very muh enjoyed playing this game as it conveyed a feeling of stress and dread as a survivor and of power and ferocity as the killer. However as of posting this review on december 11th 2017 I cannot reccomend this game. Survivors urrently have far to many advantages and make judiious use of extreamly heep tatics that give them a massive edge against the killer. I can't Stress this enough DO NOT BUY THIS GAME your money is better spent elsewhere
0;"""At first i liked the game a lot but recent DLC's just take away the fun. Overpowered killers and a toxic community Bugs and Hosts with always 250+ Ping make the game """"exhausting"""".9 months ago i would've upvote it.. But the way it is right now rather not.Grab it if it's in sale because i think the standard pricing for the game itself &amp DLCs is way too high. GIve it a try and make yourself a picture of it."""
0;U can change this game's name to Bug by Daylight. infinity bug in this game. if who play this game and met bug like me i sure u feel ubisoft is a angel. oh forget one thing Server is lag and i'm not a russia why alway meet only russia??? lagging every play is bad feeling.
0;This game is broken as not only can the survivor just loop around and the killer isn't able to catch them and kill them. Not only is this annoying it's ing how this is allowed the game isn't balanced between survivor and killer. If the killer could vault over the windows slightly faster I feel that the survivors wouldn't use the infinite loops as much.
0;This is probably one of my favorite games of all time it is incredibly enjoyable with freinds and playing alone can be insanly fun to. Unfortunantly I was recently wrongfully banned and the devs will not repeal it. All that time playing this game gone and the future memories I will make with friends also gone. I was very excited for the new DLC but it looks I wont be playing it. As much as I want to I can no longer recommend this game.
0;Here we are at 2.1.0 and things still haven't changed. Using bandaids to cover up apparent game flaws.Flashlight timing has gone out the window. Killers now have insane aura perks that allow them to see you. They nerfed all exhaustion perks when only one needed a nerf. These devs still don't know how to make a competitive game they just want you to see your can play as liscensed killers but only 2 are viable in the game. Pretty bad job so far.
0;Above average design but persistent bugs and a sadistic toxic community have destroyed this game. As decent players have moved on to other games the community has only continued to get worse. This stays in my library in case friends want to play with me but I will never pay another dime for content.
0;Today I didn't play Dead by Daylight but My account permanently baned about Dead by Daylight I want to know why?I never used Hacker or change game files please explain Why is permanently baned .Is it because I leaving/disconnecting from the matches before?If you play games you will know.Sometimes you have to quit a round of games killer intentionally increases game time(More time I just played survivors).Dead by Daylight Community Management team No reply to me Fxxx.
0;Product received for free. Spend nearly 20 min in lobby for waiting other survivors to start the fk game. Bring everything back plz. You really need to adjust this game again. It seems like no one will attend to play survivor. And it is really annoying to spend 20 min on waiting.
0;Game would be great if developers give right rules in game. Killers can use unsports behaviour to win which we survivors cannot counter. Campers and tunellers in game more than 70% of games were played with toxic killers. If developers still let killers play like this this game will be trash. For now i don't recommend this game to anyone.
0;If you like to spend you free time waiting to join a game then this is for you!! I just love being in a lobby for hours at a time hitting join join join. Maybe one day i'l lwin and actually join a game.In a nutshell this is infinate lobby hell and I want my money back!!!
0;&gt Not recommending this game until Freddy is dealt with Before he came into the game i would have recommended this game 100X over to anyone.&lt The game is amazing (With friends) but since Freddys joined its became as . He's so broke. *Plays Meg* *Gets hit with sleepiness**150% Speed boost**Enters dreamworld with Freddy sat next to me*
0;dumbest game youll ever play only reason i still play is because i have hopes that ill find a decent killer that doesnt camp or that doesnt play like a total . After 2 years they still havent found the balance between killers and survivors. They need to ban face campers.
0;Dont buy. Not even for little money.This game is the most toxic game every created and in addition got a highly toxic community.Avoid this game by all means !!!On top of this the devs are idiots and ruined a good game idea.The game is annoying and unsatisfying as the killer and as survivor. Good job.
0;It was good game but developer only playing killers so you know how it s end. Every single patch there are 20+ buffs to killers and they perks and 20+ nerfs to survivors. Game is not playeble atm.As killer even if you don t trying you auto win.It s end like you have teleporting killer who perma see you whole game and can one shot you. you can t even spring if you do it for 3sec you must stay on place 1 minute wtf.
0;This game gets worst and worst as the days go on... it tries to be something more than it needs to be while at the same time is completely repeative all the time same thing over and over. The killers can be op in the right hands. The survivors suck at getting of hooks and bear traps when you need it the most. It was once fun but not anymore Friday the 13th will completly kill this game and righfully so. Maybe Dead by Deadligh can learn a few things from it and make a 2nd one. Overall 6/10.
0;rank system sucks whenever i get to rank 15 or so i get to 20 pretty quickly because the killer leaves every single match!! its most likely impossible to get to rank 1 playing alone. That should count as a win tho or nothing rather nothing than a lose...
0;why in the hell I got all my stuff deleted? like it said that i cant join a lobby while i was playing with a friend i shut dbd down started it up then i saw that all my stuff was gone all my survivors were at level 1 got no blood points nothing. what in the is this?
0;"""Look the game's great. But the uncalled for part is the farming... Once you get that out of the way i'm sure you can go pretty far aka the Span of one more year from how the Devs find our response as """"Funny"""" or """"silly"""" Making the killers have 20 buffs in a row and 60 nerfs for survivor."""
0;This game is aight. I have played for 2 years and in that time i have learned that the killers are OP. Im a high ranked survivor as well so im not just saying that. Hit box sucks in this game and Devs do nothing to fix the mechanics of the game. They just keep producing crap killers that are OP and making the game really irritating. How about take some time to fix the game instead of dumb new killers? Devs lazy as .
0;After reaching Rank 5 as survivor i can say that is a fun game yes but 75% of killer are clearly CAMPING or a kind of so u will be bored to play after several hour killer are braindead and ruin the game so they can kill you faster and rankup so the game is for this. If you wanna try find it out by yourself this game broken cuz of braindead killer.
0;Unbalanced piece of Killer is more scared of survivors than they are scared of the killer. Pff survs are not scared at all.This game is pure unbalanced trash for killers.I used to love it when killer could kill not survivors decide how many kills killer gets usually 0.If you want to have a horror game experiance go play something else.If you want to bully a guy in the forest with 3 teammates go ahead.
0;Fun if you have a bunch of friends to play it with but the devs have no clue how to make a competative game and it really shows. Watch a couple videos on it and try it but don't be afraid to refund it. Also this game is a grind to get good perks. It will take you hundreds of games just to get one perk you want to use and you never know when the devs are going to nerf it to oblivion.
0;The game was good once upon a time and would have recommended it but as of now I can't recommend the game. The game is so unbalanced and the devs almost always side with the killers and buff the hell out of them and survivors always have been getting the short end of the stick.
0;The new patch is just awful. Pallets are still completely unsafe. Killers get a free hit across a pallet stun. Vaults get cancelled mid vault by doctor. Flashlight blinds are now impossible. 3 second delay after unhooking before you can start healing. On top of all that killers get lag advantage. I will not be playing this game until the devs fix these issues and I encourage all other survivors to stop playing to make the killer queues as long as possible.
0;The amount of bugs in this game is absolutely ridiculous. You would think you were playing a beta. I keep finishing games and my blood points are not added my pips are not added it doesn't rank or derank it doesn't give blood points for dailies. What the hell is the point if it doesn't work? Get it together and this is actually an amazing game. But unless you're willing to deal with the many MANY bugs don't get it until the developers put a bit more time in.
0;Don't bother playing this game. Besides the obnoxious balance issues its buggy as heck.In fact it will randomly delete your save profile and reset all your progress erasing everything you earned and unlocked. Don't bother asking for help restoring your profile either they will refuse.
0;I bought the game and couldnt find a match even as Killers or Survivors. Half an hour of waiting and the best lobby I found was me as the Killer and 2 other Survivors. I dont know why this happened. Made a refund afterward but still want to play it. Hope they will fix it in the future
0;after playing about 50 hours of this game soon as there new patch came out for halloween everything went to my lvl 1 wraith rank 17 has been paired agiant rank 15 5 that have charaters that are atleast lvl 25 with 4 super rare perks how is this fair i have 1 perk then the survivors complain if you camp them but the troll you hard if your doing bad then if your playing a survivor agianst micheal or the trapper you always lose if you dont have muiltple perks
0;This game is full of fklcing idiot camper killer and egoist survivors.But an easy way to win this sht game you need just to download as killer and the survivors get laags and leave easy win.If you find some people mid on day and not mid on night . sht game sht people with no skill and to much friends ..i..
0;So. I'm a new player to DBD And i can already say that there's tons of bugs that needs to be fixed. For example getting kicked out mid game for absolutely no reason at all. Random lagspikes and im on cable. Map tearing apart and alot of other stuff. I wouldn't recommend playing DBD Until it's finished.
0;Game? AmazingDevs? TerribleGame has a ton of bugs devs have no idea what is going on in their own game even after multiple reports devs refuse to believe that some bugs exist and refuse to fix them.Buy this game only if you are prepared to lose the match multiple times only because of bugs (you get stuck in a tree your game crashes).
0;Creators of this game are stupid es.THEY CANT IN BAN PLAYERS WHO CAMPS.WORST COMMUNITY EVER.WORST BALLANCE EVER.WORST REALIZATION.BAGS.LAGS.STUPID CAMPING S.STUPID BAN SYSTEM IT NEVER WORKS.OK YOU SAAY THAT THESE PROBLEMS ONLY ON LOW RANKS?NO!ABSOLUTELY IN NO!THESE PROBLEMS ARE ON ALL RANKS!I HAD 8TH RANK AND I KNOW.SO I DONT WANNA BEAT AROUND TE BUSH THAT IS WHY I CAN SAY FINAL VERDICT THIS GAME IS T AND THIS GAME FOR STUPID USELESS CREATURES
0;Freddy literally ruins the game and these devs are too to take away his perma invisibility and introduce something else that their game has died in almost 2 years. and keep in mind they just released freddy not long ago and have already had to nerf him yet they buffed him more than they nerfed him so you do the math.
0;2nd day after patch 2.1.0.What a disappointing version.I don't think it's a reasonable update. This Game totally not friendly to new players even thousands hours human palyers also can't live with a baby killer.Idk why keep buffing killers and nerfing survivors. Human has fellings. I don t criticize camping but Trapper with 2 red Add ons makes this game unplayable right now.(Using English cause I think developers are likely to see it.)
0;game after i left playing this game for friday the 13th for a couple of months. I can't get past the title screen without being intorrupted I contacted the costumer support team and i haven't gotten the issue resolved in 21 days. This game is a joke and a scam. I paid for this game and all its DLC's I supported these developers and their work. It's disgusting that they do stuff like this.
0;If u want to play as killer then you will have fun if u want to play as survaivor then ur fked up because the devoleper called this game a killer game not survaivor and killer gamerand 1 of the most stupid things that the developers are consider the killers are their gods if the killer leaves the game the survaivors got a decrease rank and if the survaivors leaves the game the killer increased his rank
0;this game is honestly trash never buy it. i dont know whats worse out of the community and the game they are both the abosolute worst humanity has to offer i hope anyone who plays it gets hit by a semi trailer and yes that includes me. in closing Devs and community you are ing worthless brainded scum bastard pile of trash mental that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerates you are humanity
0;"""i regret every cent i paid for this game and every single DLC. New Killer are always op as f*ck and those freaky devs have no clue what they are doing. I am not even sure if they have a Testing Department.Mimimis of killers are usually fixed soon and Survivors complainings treated like """"Hey....Challenge Time""""Please stop using hard drugs and try sth else like gardening instead of game development."""
0;It's a good game in of itself but the devs are sh*t they dont play the game to know what's bad ot good about the game. They perma ban players without telling them why even if it isn't an obvious reason (the player only used a glitch in a private lobby but still got banned.) The devs are just sh*t to be honest but if you want to give it a try its a game that's fun but the devs are just throwing it away and will kill the game and it's potential to something bigger. (Unban Noob3)
0;This game is fun when you play with 3 or 4 friends. You don't have them and you like being camped and killed 24h even with a lot of surviving skills ? Then this game is for you. Percentage of unfairplay killers 95%. Yeah I played a lot so I can make statistics this game is more toxic than League of Legend Call of duty and Minecraft. A travel to Tchernobyl without protection is safer for your health. Trust me don't buy this game and go play murder on Gmod.
0;Pretty bad there's no scariness or tension whatsoever. If you're a survivor you're going to win unless the hunter is cheating somehow and if you're the hunter you basically have to hope that the survivors don't know the mechanics. Most matches are over in 2 minutes because of how much benifit the survivors are given. Faster reactions chase breakers as well as the ability to just flat out stop the hunter from winning. Don't bother putting money towards this game let alone time.
0;Product received for free. i have 250 hours in this game so i know what i am talking about when i say dont buy it. dead by daylight had a golden age but it is now completely unplayable. the devs dont care about the game anymore every killer hook camps and no matter what you do dbd wont be fun. dont buy this game wait until the devs start caring or wait until another dbd like game comes out
0;a game full of error 300 codes unable to load errors restarts decentralization error's and no network errors on a 1gbps internet connection these developers really don't know how to bug test or code...... probably both.PC i7 8700k 32gb 2666 ddr4 2 x 1tb M.2 samsung 970pro 1080ti 4k
0;First time is good and scare to the player and your friends but after that is nothing to scare you.Ps. Dev didn't help my brother to check the code from Gameshow. If you want to give code to everyone come to Gameshow.You mustn't have 2 copy for 1 code / .............so sad.
0;"""Product received for free. THE GAME IS GOOD BUT ING BALANCE I START THE GAME AS A KILLIVER FIRST TIME PALY AND I SEE LVL 45 PALYERS JUKING ME AROUND WTF MORE SKILLS MORE EXPERINSE THEN US GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY AND TAKE THIS GAME FROM ME WHEN U START TO MAKE IT BALANCE THEN MAYBE WE PLAY IT """" DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THIS TILL THEY FIX THE ING PROBLEM WITH THE BALANCE """" AND I BOUGH THE DELUEX"""
0;The game is buggier than most open world survival Early Access titles. The bugs got even worse since I recommended it six months ago.Also the killer hosts which means lots of lag for everybody. Moreover fewer and fewer people are playing each day so you have to play with opponents farther and farther away which makes the lag even worse. ORIGINAL REVIEW Despite its flaws I've never been this scared in a videogame.Play both killer and survivor.
0;So this was my favorite game where I spent 750 hours playing but lobbies got horrible and then the devs got lazy. Probably the worst developers in gaming history. They don't know how to fix a launch error that at least a fourth of the people that play this game are getting.
0;Don't buy it!Pros solid gameplay funny scary and creative killers nice graphics (in my opinion)Cons Infinite grind Pay to win (you can buy teachable perks from the shrine too with shards BUT you need to grind for the shards too) bad salty troll community (the community ruining the gameplay most of the games)
0;"""Ok game now that the grinding is less. Playing with randos sucks buy only if you can play with friends. The balance is not polished. Do mind that to play this game properly you need to grind a lot of hours to get tier 3 perks and perk """"drops"""" are random...I give thumbs down because my favorite killer is still the worst (Wraith) after years..."""
0;This game is so addictive and fun but it gets annoying when half of the playerbase wants to you up instead of working in a team. It is in some parts still buggy and when you get the hang of this game then survivors are really super nerfed and killers are playing easy mode. .New update Not a lot of things got patched killers still op players are and so on.
0;Support team of this game. Please do handle all the current bugs and unstable server issue. I have been disconnected from game serveral times in a day itself. I believe it's not my network issue as my friend is still able to cont the game in the same lobby as me. This is getting so irritating for a person to play the game. Hope to see the improvement of the game itself asap.
0;this game is you can't even find a game most of the time. it will take about an hour to get into a lobby. Then once that happens you have to deal with the plathora of bugs glitches exploits. Do the devs do anything abouit them?? no absollutely not. Do not bother with this one guys you will just regret it dearly.
0;The game is really fun to play in the first 10 hours or so since you will be screaming and laughing. However the game is full of bugs and glitches and the developers fail to promptly fix any of the issues resulting in people leaving and the game dying. The game might be worth buying when its on sale but not at full price. Even then you might encounter bugs and problems with the game.
0;Holy ing hell I love this game but I can't stand my game crashing almost every single game I play. I'd be nice to get a patch this fix this...I will change this review once patches are released to fix this problem. /Update Ahh yes an update now I get in trouble for when my game crashes now wooooo.
0;Wish I had more hours on record but it's hard when I can't even get in a damn game. Most of my hours are waiting in a lobby trying to find a game only to be booted or never connect. Luckily for me when (if) I do get in a game I get the most broken busted up piece of glitch game ever. Should have set $17 on fire and saved some time.
0;Game used to be a lot of fun with friends but over the past few months it has become a true nightmare to play. Too many bugs to count no improvements to survivors or killers whatsoever sure we're being bombarded with new characters all the time but what's the point if the game is filled with bugs and off balanced items. Game definitely needs a caring hand graphics wise not sure if it's the engine it's running or it's just lack of experienced texture artists. Game has a lot of potential.
0;"""The lastest update to DBD is a cluster of a mess it's super killer sided based from the update nerfed survivors once again for listening to the reddit community. Now I wish this game was reverted back to the old ways before all these """"balancing"""" updates came out. I'm super dissapointed with the devs. What next adding a add on that insta kills survivors?"""
0;If you are part of Oceania (New Zealand and Australia) then don't buy this game as you will have a VERY long wating times in the lobby for people to join (15 to 30 minutes at times) I just wish someone told me about this before I bought the game. 100% not worth buying for this issue alone.
0;Too many glitches and bugs the killer just sits there and stares at you on the hook so theres no chance of survival once you go down theres too much they need to fix and youll just get frustrated with the game if you haven't already frozen or gotten kicked out. Shouldn't have been released to the public yet.
0;The game itself is really great WHEN IT WORKS. When you contact support they just tell you to take the same steps that are listed in the forums and they DONT WORK. If not for the chronic issues I would recommend this highly but since you can expect disconnections delays and other issues with no support I have to give it a bad review.
0;You in' devs you are destroying the masterpiece you made... Well just like the four eyes dev said... I'll go play GTAV or PUBG or something more playable than this crap! And it hurts me to comment this but hey like I said you're making this masterpiece a total disaster.I really used to love this game but now wow... No words#DISAPOINTED#HEARTBRAKE
0;Game is fun buggy sometimes unfair a good majority of the time and has a fairly toxic community... I was alright with this game then something weird happened it uninstalled itself. I thought nothing and sat for an hour and a half for it to reinstall. Cool works fine. Unistalls again. And again. And again. I can only take this as a sign that this game is not worth it. No amount of forums troubleshooting or entire reinstallation of steam has fixed this. Meh games okay.
0;If you read the forums many players have lost their progress to some bug in the game and had our levels reset to 1 losing all our perks and items. The lack of communication be it by email or forums from the developers is non existant. Some players have even had their accounts wiped multiple times.
0;It used to be a great game that was fun and addicting. Now it's more of a chore to play because of the Devs tendancy to ignore their own community.Recently they've even taken a step further and now silence any that is critical of their product. You can still find enjoyment in this game be beware of what you're purchasing.
0;The game is very fun and has a lot of potential. With that said the number of game crashes/graphics card crashes increases every patch and for that reason I cannot recommend this game. The devs need to tackle the countless bugs and crashes the game faces before adding new content but that doesn't seem to be their priority. Very unfortunate.
0;This game is not worth the full Price. Get it only if its like 5 Bucks. Massive bug and balance issues most toxic community i ever seen (worse than lol) no dedicated servers and devs.Game is poorly optimized so it runs poorly. A lot of hacking and Exploring. Random sometimes undeserved bans and no bans for obvious cheaters. Dont recomend.
0;What is with all of the whining about this game being too hard on the survivors? This game seems to be heavily skewed for the survivors to win. Just a clue to the Dev's it's supposed to be difficult to survive a horror movie not easy. If someone can fix a generator within 30 seconds of starting the match that is a problem.
0;"""Fun and exciting at first.Then you see that there s nothing resembling """"horror"""" in this thing. It s more like a tag game.The game developers seem to think that survivors are entitled to escape so they give them so many OP perks it s insulting really. The survivors don t fear the killer. At all.They will loop t bag body block blind use their BS perks and bully him to hell and back.I would get a refund if I could.Stay away from this one."""
0;This ing game needs to pay more attention to BOARDS(PLANKS). The amout of hook is more than the ing boards besides the ing new maps are so ing that I can't even believe someone has made this out...This game has to fix so much things and think why The Fifth Identity is better than you DBD.
0;Game players are toxic as ive put almost 400 hours into this game and anytime i get in a match teamates are straight and killers facecamp like a theres no point running borrowed time as killer will still tunnel your into oblivion games not worth the money or the time
0;the game is really fun. . . . . . when you get to play it . . . . . a friend and i qued up for a game got to play one then tried for 1 hour to get another game going....if you want to play by yourself and match up with others its not as hard to get a game but if you want to try and survive with 1 or 2 friends good luck with that. i may no longer play the game because you never get into a game anyways
0;Dead by Lobby or Dead by Lag Cheats. It's not even really that it spends time for matchmaking but it's so buggy you spend 4 to 5 times just trying to get it to find a match.This game has it's moments and it is great fun. Assuming you want to wait for it.Since the Killer hosts the server you get to deal with 100's of lag cheaters...
0;it's lige the devs dont play the game them self. ive always been a surv main but recently it's been a nightmare they just keep buffing the killer. so now ive gone over to killer main and good greif it's easy.... i dont get why 50% of all the killers cry.
0;"""Excellent game. Definitely a genre changer for horror! Also add slendermanEdit Still haven't fixed buggy servers so I'm goin got change this from a """"yes"""" to """"no"""". When they fix the damn servers I'll vote up.Edit 7/28/18 The dedicated servers work pretty well now. Will update once I try """"KYF"""" mode.Edit 7/28/18 Nvm. Servers are fine. Matchmaking is horrible. Over 15 minutes for queue time with over 20000+ players online."""
0;the game looks a bit brighter. but i find myself at the beggining of the game having to alt + tab to fix the mouse issue. i find that killers kicking gens is kool but thats about it. it looks a bit better but i feel like the brightening the game makes it worse. the wait times to get a match weather it is killer or surviver is still bad. dont think anyone needs to waste time in a lobby simulator.
0;The game is unbalanced and punishes you for playing killer. Survivors have too much control over the game. The killer's ability to do well is contingent on the skill level of the survivors. Too many loops make the game unplayable. I will not play this game again until changes are made. New game rating 1/10 stars. This game is currently a toxic hell hole.
0;The question is simple do I recommend the game? No. Because the people who's making this game doesn't do sh*t about every f*cking bugs there is in this game and the servers are complete sh*t the only changes they're doing is new dlc's and thats it. The game was awesome at release but not they don't care about it anymore. PS Finding a game will take you atleast 10 minutes for 5 minutes of gameplay (if you're lucky).
0;ProsFun for a bitIt can be a great game to play with friendsConsLag/no region capCamping playersdevelopers release new content before fixing the old playing with friends is fun but matchmaking isn't working properly and hasn't been working for months so you will spend more time in the lobby versus actually playingAfter 1004 hours i rate this 5/10 would not recommend I stopped playing this game about 3 weeks ago and i don't regret it one bit
0;The game itself is a pretty decent idea but the balance right now is absolutely rank some killers cost money to play and are absolutely terrible anyways after being week one nerfed despite being subpar BEFORE the nerf. The developers would rather stick their head into the ground when constructive critisim is brought up and will even brush it off by saying you should 'play civilization' the series instead outright telling you to play a different game. Its really bad. Don't buy this game.
0;Devs are officially braindead and people like TydeTyme understand the game more than the devs themselves. This update is absolute and I'm sick of their Don't bother buying this game unless you want to be a toxic survivor main.Slowly losing faith in this game...
0;fun but has bug right now. havent played in a while now because i cant get into a match at all. if i do then the lag is so terrible that death in game is absolute. complete garbage at this point. instead of going forward they make it work for a bit then screw it up. more like a yo yoUPDATE can no longer even play the game. been an absolute waste of time and money. spent more time troubleshooting than actually playing. the devs really f! #$d this one......
0;The game is just broken half the time i join or try to join a server i get a infinite loading screen. So this is going to remain a bad review untill this bug is fixed so i dont have to close dead by daylight 50 times a day just to have a 10% chance to play a game
0;Bad review! Reason no other playing the butcher is simply too happy to play and play now can run a human can jump on the cellar is good and weaken the hunting experience with accelerated run no problem also invincible also weakened meaning that the butcher play The joy of human beings on the all dead.
0;I cannot give this game a positive review atthis time.. there is to many problems. I just recently lost all my saved data and there is no estimated time for a fix. over 300 hours lost multiple prestige suriviors and killers all gone. that and connection issues that plague this game its just to much.. its been out over a year and its not getting fixed but they have no problem pumping out DLC content NOPE NOPE ... Im out...
0;Played the game for 160 hours just to have all my stats wiped on the arival of the new season. Lost a lot of powerfull killer addons and perks. I emailed the support about this problem 4 days ago and so far it does not seem like they care. No email back and so far my stats have not been fixed. I'm glad I wasted my money on all the DLC just for them to wipe all my stats. THANKS DBD TEAM!!
0;I love this game clicking the ready button is what i love the most about this game. my more so when the killer is laggin his off but i donno the ready button really is what keeps me playing this game with my friends of corse we all enjoy the ready button )
0;Edit So after months of giving the game some time and the devs to work on their broken game... uh... here's what I noticed Now you don't need to spam the Find Lobby Button it will automatically search for a lobby for you after you select it once. And... it still doesn't work.Looks like I didn't miss anything important while I actively decided to not play the game. Cool beans.
0;Eternally buggy. If it worked 100% it would almost be a perfect game. I love this game but I cannot defend it objectively. I keep playing because they slowly fix it while breaking it along the way and I'm just hoping they fix it eventually.Edit One year later the devs keep adding DLC without fixing obvious issues like P2P hosting. The South African community as also disappeared completely forcing me to play on overseas servers so people complain about lag and flame me. fun.
0;Dont play survivor if you want to rage because if your teammates feel like being ing idiots and not helping you or grab gens its gg because the hunter finds you first because your the only one on the gen. this has happened so many times ive played survivor more because i have more fun on it when i have good teammates but that was only onve they need to make a bigger reward for saving teammates.
0;The game is sirriously broken the patches most of the time up the game even more cause the killer is getting more and more op most of the time while survivors are being nerved. not only that when you play solo you are able to play 1 and maybe if you are lucky 2 matches before your loading screen bugs and you have to restart the game...
0;I would kinda recommend this game but not really killers disconnect after 10 mins of trying find a game or they will leave mid game after using gained items so they are wasted and now to end it all my 185 hours worth of progress has been bugged and now it's dead
0;The game itself is great. But the community is complete SH&lt 3T. The community lacks empathy for the killers at all times they'll complain for just about any excuse they can find. Making the killer side not very attractive to play since your by yourself fighting against 4 people after having been trolled ingame.
0;This is a game for people who play killer if you want to be survivor good luck every patch the devs suck the of the killers so hard they survivors nerfs all over their face. If you like to play only killer this is the game for you if you don't save your money and play another game.
0;I honestly enjoy playing this game but objectively it's not a good game. The devs are clueless have no idea on how to properly balance a game and overall just don't know how to make a good game. Being toxic is the only thing that keeps this game alive. Because it keeps people coming back to get payback on each other. Without people abusing game mechanics the game is boring. And the way the devs are pushing this game it's going to get even more boring.
0;I really do love this game even after hours of playing.But today after playing one game suddenly all of my progress was gone.I wasn't doing anything against the rules and still everything is wiped away I'm really not amused.Edit I got told that I will get my bloodpoints back but I still haven't gotten anything...I'm a bit disappointed...
0;"""Good game but the awkward side is a moderators community. I saw cheaters in every 2th game with speedhacks &gt but i was banned for a """"griefing"""". Dont even think to buy this s h i t with p2w (cause cool killers cost money). If u wanna game like this better buy """"Friday the 13th""""."""
0;stop playing for maybe 2 months come back and all of the I grinded out for gone.There goes my enthusiasm to play this game anymore camping and the fact that its been months since its release but still no in game comms other than the idiotic chat board just held this game back. They would much rather release as much skins as they can to milk this game
0;In this broken state you cant play the killer anymore. Thanks to a user and youtuber named Ochid0 the survivors are using bugs and exploit the games flaws. They pallet loop juke and try everything to just the killer off. Its so unbalanced right now. I love this game but with it being so broken i just cant recommend it. Let the devs first fix the game and then buy it. I hope pallet looping and the exploits are getting people banned and or fixed.
0;This is a great game. But the matchmaking system... OMG the worst of the worst match making system. Not because of level but literally trying to find a game for 30 minutes. Start matchmaking and you will go to loading screen then you will get kicked back to the menu. Now I can't even play this game and it's just a waste of time to sit there desparatly finding a match
0;Dont buy this game. After 6 months from its release its still buggy af. Waiting to get to a match for 30 minutes just to find out that im the only survivor. Also the communitty is full of campers and rage quiters. Devs only care about their crappy dlcs . 5/10
0;"""Some Dlc killers are extremely unbalanced and giving this game a """"pay to win"""" aspect. A good example of this is """"The Nightmare on Elm Street"""" Dlc which adds the killer """"Freddy Krueger"""" to the game which is a lot better at killing the survivors than other killers like... Trapper Wraith Hillybilly and the Huntress. This game is amazing if you take away the """"pay to win"""" dlc."""
0;dont buy this game its not fun you play vs campers and if you odnt play with friends you get in a match with idiots trust me this game is not fun and if you want to play as killer you get only gen rushers so its not fun please dont waste 20 dollars buy something else.
0;t survivors sided game both end have problems and devs don't give a about the balance. Killer clowns everywhereSurvivors kings who destroy with their infinite crutch perks.This game can die already I won't play it anymore.Hope F13 or Last year will be better. t game
0;"""Since day 1 I have a bug issue that causes me to randomly be stuck """"waiting"""" when I am queued in matchmaking only as survivor. Why the is this bug not fixed? I have had to close out via task manager a great multitude of times cause you game devs are being little es. You have lost me as a future customer of your products because of this. Remain amatuers and less than even 2nd class for not being on top of the most important element of game making. Fix the bugs losers!!!"""
0;This game is not meant for killers these daysDo not buy it untill you want to get looped by survivors and throw away your PC or laptop in rageStopped playing it myself after 300+ hoursWill start it if the devs make changes to stop unnecessary toxicity because there is no skill required in what most survivors doThe game is although good for survivors
0;Product received for free. Hello to militate the creators. Your game is badly destroyed. I have a good potential but your team does not do anything about it it's amazing that you are adding new Killers but the game is balanced no . I use the game but I do not play it and I will not play it! For this reason I do not recommend the game. I hope that the native of the creator took the heart.Sorry for bad Eanglish )
0;Actually I'm playing this game for accomplish achievement progress . That's all.Dead by Daylight Spontaneous errors. They don't fix it all.There are no balance some of bad reputation ... They don't ban hackers .. (or who offended another person etc.)I think I can understand why people insult this game Behavior Digital contaminate their own game. REALLY.
0;"""I wish I could return this.It's unbalanced and correctly called a camping sim. If it was any easier for the killers they would have a big red button that appears on their screens that says """"Win game botton"""" There is little reason to play as a survivor"""
0;Game is extremely bugy and as a result of attempts to balance the power between killers and survivors the actual gameplay has been ruined and is no longer fun for either party. Might be worth it if you can get the game for $5 or less just to try it out. I will check back in to see how the game is in a few months and update my review if things have improved.
0;Pay to win killers are horribly OP the doctor is game breaking and its been several patches and they havent tweaked him at all. Apparently the developers would rather have more money rather than everyone with the base game continuing to enjoy the game with the balanced killers
0;This was an amazing game. I enjoyed playing it for hours and hours. It takes an expertly skilled group of developers to it up in such spectacular fashion but somehow the developers of Dead By Daylight managed it with ease. I hope they can fix it but I am doubtful as no matter how much they add it will consistently be unless they fix what they already have.
0;"""+ Its fun to play with friends ( full team of 4 players ) . Then is very easy to win . Bit violent (FINALLY!) Extremly lagged servers when you play on publicUPDATE 27.10.2017After last DLC """" 26 OCTOBERA Nightmare on Elm Street """"Is the game completly unplayable as survivor. Dev created ultra killer with OP skills .uninstalled . steamsalty steamsalty"""
0;Never recommend this game. There are several reasons for this...1) You are guaranteed in every 2 3 match will come across camper2) There are a lot of bugs .. Not looking at what developers are still trying to fix bugs it turns out that they clean up 1 bug but automatically add 5 7 more bugs...3) Well of course....DOCTOR!
0;This game would be good. It has great potential. The DC's freezing (new update) toxic community and crutch and meta perks on both sides take away from what could be a great gaming experience. I neither do or don't recommend it it can be fun but issues run wild in it.
0;If you're someone that has a tendency to rage at anything that includes the following Lag Hackers Pallet looping spammers. Well frankly this game is that. I would'nt buy it unless you have friends in a private match because the online is an absolute S*** show. Also you will have more bad matches than actually winning the match so it's not really worth picking this up for online random match making play.
0;Game is completely unbalance the devs/mod r too lazy to fix that. this game gain money from addin big names killer like myers freddy leatherface.. they work very fast for banning people for stupid reason but work ages for fixing their game XD.. the irony is real with this game.. and the toxic rate is extremely high.. dont bother buying this game.. bad devs bad mod bad community.. waste of money and time believe me cause iam one of them victim for stupid banning
0;This game has potential but for now it is really crappy. Most of the time I get reallybad lags where it is impossible to run because I would keep teleporting backwards. Lots of bugs that have not been fixed for a long time. I do not recommend this game.
0;Worst game ever.This game is so unbalanced.Im not talking about the op killers but about survivors jumping over the same pallete over and over again with you to have no chance of grabbing them.Good thing i didnt buy this game on steam so i didnt support these developers.Make the game balanced or dont give paid dlcs.
0;Ok my people listen here this game can be fun but I'm gonna be the guy who says don't buy it. It's fun *to an extent*. It becomes not fun around 100ish hours then it starts to swish into very competitive. Honestly you can invest less money to a small game that's fun and growing. (Soul at Stake) But not my money just my opinion. Bien merci.
0;"""I really like this game...but there are a few things wrong with it. As a killer you can be out done by simple goofy mind numbing gimmicks like pallet running. This is where someone just runs in circles for minutes on end. It ruins any fun of the game. I'm not sure how/why the devs don't do something about this. Anyway I wouldn't buy this game until you read about updates to things like """"pallet looping"""" or """"pallet running."""""""
0;Dead By Daylight a (coop) survival horror game I've been waiting for.There are many flaws yet it's one of its kind &amp I don't know any similiar game who does it that well.I really hope the devs won't screw it up then I can see me playing this for quite a while.For now thumbs up.EDIT To be honest their dlc policy is getting out of hand. Wouldn't recommend it due to the fact all the dlc costs almost 3 times as much as the base game.
0;This is a perfect example of a dying game. The devs have ran out of ideas and now are looking to grab any money they can before the game dies. They have buffed killers to all hell and as every single survivor leaves this game it becomes harder to find a game as a killer. At this point the game will be dead by daylight.
0;"""A game where the killer can be ran around 1 wood structure with 1 wood pallet in between him while 3 people bust generators out like nothing yet its """"killer bias"""" I played survivor more than killer but now i understand this game is so survivor friendly it's"""
0;"""Game is addicting but community sucks and developers are the most incompetent i've ever seen in years. People still play with speedhacks hacked legacy and 5000 flashlights on each character and i got PERMANENTLY banned for no reason ( """"Devs"""" didn't even answer when i asked for explanations ).Don't even spend money on this"""

0;In an attempt to stop people using macros the devs have taken a nuclear approach that makes the game unplayable for some.I am no longer able to use a steam controller. my backup controller a dualshock 4 has also fallen victim of the update and the touchpad no longer works.. which means sitting near the mouse and keyboard is now a necessity.i have sunk many hours into this game but the devs are the most shortsighted lazy people i have ever come across.
0;The game used to be a lot of fun however since i got back into the game it is clear that the game is far too easy for the killers. the survivors can do almost nothing against certain killers that can down you in one hit and they also have perks that make it far to easy find you. not to mention leveling up a survier is much harder since they barely get any points as compaired to the killer. over all dont waste your time if you want to be a survior.
0;pros skill gap unique customization licensed killerscons balance toxicity people disconnecting from the game without any punishment people making new accounts to play with ranks 1 matchmaking with 150 200 ping killers getting stuck where survivors can pass freely broken perk system decisive strike still in the game broken items survivors more powerful than the killer worst way possible to report a player that is cheating
0;Laggy host. Ping is green in lobby. Game starts and it lags. Some hosts doing lag switches. People farm to cheat and get bloodpoints. Streamers that live stream for the public farm cheat and gain bloodpoints by playing around not doing legit objective gameplay. Gamers in this game are not playing the game but instead goof around. You can get reported for unsportsmanlike farming points etc. But nothing ever happens to them.
0;As of8/9/2016 it has way better game still crashes but once a day is better than every other game! Most likley from using a controller . Still lobby waiting issues but not as bad as previous updates. Match making is still uneven but they claim to be working on it! As of 1/9/2017 back to being way buggy! Infinite loading screens hard to find a lobby for a game bug exploit is ridiculous. People losing all the progress ! Save your money right now!
0;This game is baited for more and more new killer. Devs keep saying that this game is already balanced. Killer is already DEAD by daylight. ) Might be fun to play with your friends as survivor or play alone as survivor. Totally not recommend on playing killer. Play as survivor instead. idk why I'm I still playing this game and even bought of those DLC...
0;Updating my review This game continuously is catering to survivors. Survivors being able to communicate in game breaks the core concept of the game. Now they are worsening it even further.When you get to higher ranked play the ability to communicate makes it near impossible for the killer to do anything.Top it all off with the countless bugs that never go away this game just becomes nothing but frustrating. GG BHVR was fun while it lasted.
0;im sorry to say that im now very unhappy with the game its not working for me and is to slow pluse when i get off the game i have to restart me computer because i cant watch anhythingplease if you get this text me back i would like to see what the problem is with the game and whi its slower this it was on my other computer that wasnt for games
0;rank system emblem patch.cant rank up anymore with the new emblem rank system rank gets reset every 13th of the month. no REWARDS for ranking gameplay just gets worse to killer camping and tunneling hard. just a peice of sht game. pls dont buy thisgames only fun for like 1 2 hours per session anymore than that is frustrating HAHAHAA
0;"""A perfect game that went from 100 to a zero.""""Do you know how hard it is to pull of a perfect loop?"""" Nah there is no skill needed.If u want to play killer and enjoy it don't even consider.There is no way to improve as a killer no matter what u do Survivors will run around pallets till the game is over."""
0;Product received for free. This game can get really boring after 50 hours on it please dont whaste your money on this.iTS 20 DOLLARS WTF PLUS THE DLC WHICH MEANS IF YOU ESIMATE THE GAME IS REALLY35 DOLLARS WHICH IS 2/3 OF THE GAME AND 1/3 OF COURSE YOU CAN STILL PLAY BUT IT GETS SOOO BORING!!!!! Look all i have to tell you is i whasted my money on this trash game and i dont want that happening on anyone else
0;Game is full of toxic players. killers who camp and tunnel. Survivors who use perks that are toxic to play against and then teabag. I spent a lot of time playing this game and used to enjoy it. lately its just made me sad to play. i get on for a few hours and never actually play a game because of all the toxic play. The worst part is these toxic players get rewarded for thier toxic play. Its sad. So very sad. I wish i had my money and my time back.
0;Very bad game full of bugs game mechanics is bad killers tunnel players and players loop killers very boring play dynamic.Also you need to know that this game has not dedicated server. The killers host the game so they can lag your connection as they want. Killer is in trouble? No problem. He just open youtube and your game start to lag you cannot play and he kills you easily. Wow. Really fair.Don't buy.
0;The developers don't test their games before patches and they ruin the gameplay with every patch and the communities always whine and highlight the problems and issues but the developers do not listen. Do not waste your time spend it on youtube watching ppl play is alright but don't spend your money on this.
0;"""Just stop playing this Rank 20 full of deranking rank 1 Rank 10 full of scumbags. Rank 1 full of the same you will find in your way there. You can't literally play this game. The devs are just trash and can't manage the game community is full of toxic russian kids who can't even speak english and just say """"ez"""" after they hide mid chase. go back to csgo idiots. The russian kids ruin every ing game they come to."""
0;great game has a few problems like the killer being pointless after rank 10 there are few killers if they have the perks that could kill you all but most of the time the survivors win beacause...........hatch10/10 would be looped and pallet againso there was this one time they had a good killer but dont worry they nerfed it to Your welcome bitvh survivors
0;It's fun when you can actually find a lobby. There are some frustrating mechanics when playing the killer such as spots where it's impossible to catch survivors if you're playing a certain killer and if they play ring around the rosey with a window but I only play the nurse now so now I have people complaining about me breaking game mechanics rather than the other way around.Edit Nurse was nerfed there are still spots survivors are immune game is too easy for survivors at high ranks.
0;Product received for free. Before I think this game was the most fun I had played but lately there has been a lot of wallhack and cheat that makes me lose some interest taking the game. and not least some error on the game. so before I could recommend the game but not now anymore
0;PROS Great game ideea.CONS Too many campers rage quiters and players who take the game hostageI had fun playing this game for 350 hrs under 30 fps on lowest settings enev tho this game is very buggy.The comunity is so salty and overpopulated by kids under 12 years old even tho this is a horror game.You will experience 1v3 cause of quiters.In the end i think that this game does hape potenitial but the devs are caring more about the money than their game.
0;So I have played this for a good amount of hours and even have three dlc's for it but this game is so buggy and broken that it ruins the experience for me. Freddy the new killer A.K.A Sandm an is Op and broken. The hag is broken. The Cannibal is OP with a AOE one shot. Devs choose not fix like what is going on lol? I also cannot do killer rounds now? what is this bug?
0;Please....Make this game BETTER!!!WTF happen to you delevoper?I don't need more DL ing C right now.I need you to solve all ing BUGssssss problem. ing SEARCHING problem...Wait 15 Mins To Play ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ing game...R U ing kidding me?PS. Right now your game is suck... really suck... so don't make it SUCKER.
0;I really like the gameplay but I really hate the lobby system!! There is no effing excuse to have to wait 60 seconds from when the fourth suvivor joins to when the matchs loads. The timer reaches ten seconds then boom someone leaves! The option to start match when there is only one survivior should have been added! Plus the is the fact this game eats RAM. It was running at 4.5GB when I ran it for an hour! I cannot recommend this game til the Devs fix some of the issues with it!!
0;the devs are destroying a great game randomly banning people for no reason then when they try to send in an email to get unbanned or get their items back they get ignored I'm honestly starting to think that they are happy with how much money they made off it and dont care about the game anymore.
0;Getting people banned for no reason. Noob3 OchiDO Monto. I don't know why but im guessing that they might have shown some exploits to their viewers. But its not bannable if they show an exploit than ing fix your game and don't randomly ban people. A lot of hard work got lost.
0;"""To Many Fkn buggs no servers so the one who plays as """"killer"""" will be the host. a killer with bad connection super laggy and almoast impossible game to play. Way to many buggs as i mentioned earlier game is extremly unbalanced. Survivors wont get punished for """"Trolling or Greifing"""" So my point is.... dont buy this game if you are not a fan of rageing....."""
0;The game is nice don't get me wrong but the entire staff is literally a joke including the mods on discord. When you try to ask for help they literally bash you for trying to communicate with them I even received a warning for trying to communicate regarding my issue with the game. They take days to reply to email and everytime they fix a bug 5 more pop up. The list goes on and on personally I would suggest for you to wait for last year the game it is coming out soon!
0;In it's current state i can't say i recommend this game. There's just too many balance issues that make it unfun to play as killer. While this game has alot of promise the devs haven't showed to me that they have the ability to fix this game. I'll check up on Dead by Daylight every now and then and will change my review if the game gets better. But for now i would not recommend you buy this game.
0;Pretty good game in alpha state that has been released as full game. This game is full of exploits and bugs but is really good and funny to play. 9/11. /edit I trusted devs for making this game a really good co op but they rather chosen the way of DLCs nad NEW STUFF FOR A LOT OF MONEY WORTHLESS GAME DEFINITELY NOT WORTH TO BUY ANYMORE A LOT OF EXPLOITS AND BUGS AFTER 6 MONTHS.
0;The game was fun in the beginning but now the killers are way too op and all DBD does is keep making killers stronger. At this point it is unbearable for me and they just keep on moving in the wrong direction. I would only recommend this game to someone seeking to play killer.
0;Tbh i just feel it's a game where they are just trying to make more money off of it instead of improve the game when it has things that need improving and/or fixing. It can be fun but mostly only with friends seeing how this game has a huge toxic fanbase and the devs don't care and somewhat support it.
0;Can you please make servers for Russians only? They're cancer.And fix the problem with tunnelers and hook campers then this game might be worth to buy.But still this game is pretty good. At least I can feels some emotions while playing sometimes negative ones sometimes positive. Well mostly those bad but...Ranking system sucks so hard even when you'll make 20k bp in game you can still don't get the pip and devs won't listen to players
0;"""Was a great game upon release but the game has become too much of a """"video game"""" if that makes sense. I hate how everyone can have each others perks I don't like how the survivors are blatantly stronger than the killer I hate how there's a """"meta"""" in a supposed """"horror game"""".6/10 the devs will probably ban me after this post )"""
0;fun game if you play it with friend. and really frustated if you trying as a killer.1 year ago this game is booming. even there there is unbalance here and there. some people can overcome this some are not.Bad SEA server dont brother to buy the game is dead in our server. you are going to have a hard time to find a match if you playing as a killer. this happen because most of killer comunity is cry baby person. because so many nerf again survivor no one play this game anymore on SEA server.
0;"""Played for almost 900 hours since last Dec.It pains me to put the thumb down but however it is truly what I am thinking about this game right now.All I want to say is can people really understand """"asymmetrical"""" this word or it means just unfair for themHow long i can survive during the match depends only on the amount of the pallets but totally not how I played then why should I carry on with this game?"""
0;A killer with a mini sqirt. No power notin just a sissy girl. A soilder a dedective a brave man who been in fights running from a sissy girl. This must be a joke. Dont buy couse devalopers start becoming sexual tinkers rather than logical. Unless ur a horny boi just dont buy.
0;this game its broken AF many times when i complete an action like wiggle i complete it but it doesnt let me fall off from the killer this game is nearly as broken as pubg and some killers are OP like freddy pls get this damn game fixed and the community btw is TOXIC AF when im the killer nomatter WHAT i get reported for camping( even though i dont) and get reps ive never had that many as i got from 1 game now its 2018 its better but still buggy
0;Actually a really fun game if you don't mind a game that plays like it is in beta still. Prepare for alot of bugs.Update Still alot of bugs and daily rituals to escape with certain people don't work half of the time so I never get my points. Also did this to a friend. Maybe if they fix this and more I'll give it a good review again.
0;"""if you wanna be a survivor main and say this game is good then by all means in all honesty theres a reason why killers leave this game at a rapid rate because it ing sucks. """"Horror"""" more like lets bully the killers please change the game genre to comedy because this game is a laughable excuse of horror."""
0;Its cheap and gets a lot of fun just DONT GO TO THE FORUMS DONT PLAY SOLO AND LEAVE EVERY MATCH AFTER YOU DONE LOL always play on voice wiht your friends and you can have fun.Comunity of this game is TOXIC AS Hell P.S Dont over do in the hours or is gonna become a hate and love relationship game
0;The game was great fun as a survivor but then the hoardes of terrible players began to emerge the main limitation of this game at the moment is match making with new players being matched up with more experienced ones they metaphorically get dicked upon. It takes longer than 2 games to be paired with actual survivors.Could you incorporate a *practice based tutorial* on a players intial game to introduce them to all the components of playing?
0;Liked the game very much before but after The Pig was added to the game and all the nerfs to survivors came after her update i found it not fun as a survivor. I used to love playing survivor but the game changed too much after all the nerfs to survivor perks. Killer wasn't even hard to play before. But over all not fun anymore would not recommend unless they make a vanilla mode.
0;Devs don't care. Customer service tickets and player reviews go to nowhere. Pray to your gods that you don't lose progression... because the devs will not make you whole unless you are in the very fortunate minority. There is no profit to be had as they already have your money.Community is generally toxic but if you find a pocket of decency you should cling to it as long as possible. Good luck if you get this game.
0;Now Dead by Daylight is a great great game and I think it's one of the best co op survival games out there. But I've encountered numerous bugs/glitches and also a lot of hackers that the developers just don't care enough to fix/ban which makes the game a lot of fun. Like when you have a trapper placing bear traps everyone or a glitched survivor. So I wouldn't recommend it unless they could fix a lot of these problems.
0;THIS GAME IS UNBALANCED. FIX YOUR GAME MATHIEU COTE AND THE REST OF THE DEVS. THE SURVIVORS ARE TOO WEAK AND KILLERS ARE TOO OP. I PLAYED 5 GAMES AS WRAITH WITH NO PERKS AND KILLED EVERY SURVIVOR EVERY ROUND I PLAYED. ALSO BRING BACK THE MOVEMENT FROM 1.3
0;i enjoy this game but the devs are they keep pushing very unfriendly anti consumer ideas. their trying really hard to push microtransactions. the community is pretty toxic lots of kids and grown adults that act like children and don't cooperate in this cooperative game so if your going to get it get it with friends.
0;"""If you want toxic &amp #(#)$! # calling you a lag switcher then this is the game for you. Im probably getting banned for """"Lag Switching"""" when in Reality I don't have a $*#)0*$ clue how to get it It's Just because 1) I have 4$ (! $ Mcdonald's Internet 2) Ajit Pai being a #*($ (#)$% and taking my internet freedom away from me.3) Because i'm !&amp #)($ poorThanks Starbreeze Studios and Behaviour Interactive you guys did """"A pReEtY gOoD jOb So FaR"""" TheGamerGuy1"""
0;So here we are with dbd not being a god game the lagswitches are constant the toxic people are endless and people saying that your hacking is over the top and this game is not balenced what so ever removing vacum pallets was a bad step and making fast vaults slow vaults is actually if i was maneging this game i would go back to 1.4 please devs just go back to 1.4
0;"""Used to be fun. Now the developpers don't care if the game is fun. They only care if it's """"balanced"""". Have fun slowly crawling over a window sill while a 10' tall monster is chasing you or the killer swinging from 10' behind you sliding behind you instantly and slaping the out of you. They don't care if the game is fun you're their and you'll play what they give you."""
0;Game is no where close to balanced. Salty killers can decide your fate completely. If they want to ruin one persons game they absolutely can because its like they are the dungeon master. The game is far from skill based. Killers have so much aura reading they may as well have wall hacks. You get one 2nd life perk which is decisive strike and killers can juggle you or slug you to avoid it. Game was designed by a bunch of half brain money snatchers. Do not buy this piece of product.
0;Earlier it was lesser more good game now creators of this shet hear only maniacs game become totally disbalanced where your skill can't be shown by anything either you maniac who makes 4 each match just because devs make it such easy shet or survivor who might be a good runner but still get rekt cause of no pallets and other stuff. Somewhen i loved this game much now its balance is broken apart
0;There was a 21 9 resolution workaround that I was using for a while. Then I stopped playing the game and they removed it. Now I actually see less than other people. If they fix I will change it to a positive feedback.Update They still haven't added it back and probably never will.
0;The Nurse is actually stupid no joke. She's not hard and probably one of the easiest to play even without add ons. (same thing with The Spirit) AND survivor's hitboxes are massive. Making it seem like the killer hits so hard that the wind is the thing that hits them.
0;when you are killer and there is a survive with friends group that all they do is loop every single person i went up to loops a window a pallet and theres nothing to do about it the only thing you can do these days is ing play with noobs thats are like rank 20 or 15 or 10 this just don't seem right
0;Its a very nice survival game but it needs some work to be perfect and some balance.You also need to focus at the community needs cause you may lose players...i dont anymore recomend this game i explain why right here https //steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1696045708663734053/my personal score was 9/10 my personal score is 7/10 updatedmy personal score is 3/10
0;I play it since release.The game was nice but they destroyed it the killers are too strong. Every new killer has more op perks witch destroy the game. The survivors perks are fixed and balanced but killerperks are way to strong.When i play killer i always get 3 4 kills cause its to easy. The legion is a joke. His ability to rush is very unbalanced.Pls fix the killers they are way to easy to play.I enjoyed the game in the past but now its broken.sorry dead by daylight but its not fun anymore.
0;"""The Killerrole is WAY TOO STRONG and the Killer always use the same perks (nurses noed bbq and ruin) i played a lot of matches this night and only got this perk combination. I played like 15 matches and survived 3 or 4...(I'm not that bad) it's a really """"balanced"""" game...dont buy this game until its balanced so you should never buy it!"""
0;So here we are. 1500 hours in... And I can't stand the game anymore. The developers don't care about the game and are just in it to make more skins and micro purchases. Due to balance issues and lack of fun the game has became unplayable. Was once a great game then Mcote (A developer of the game) broke it. Doubt I will return but was fun while it lasted.
0;While I admit that the game is fun what is not fun though are paid characters. Now I know that these characters are like 7 8 usd a piece when was the last time that a character(s) were given for free? I think that the last one was The Huntress which was ages ago. While I do agree that the game needs to make money it would be nice to give something for free too. I mean Legion would have been wonderful Christmas present for the community instead they opted to monetize him/her.
0;Broken loading screen brings me down every time. And I definitely CAN'T match other player when I create a lobby as a killer (Rank 20). Why would u save that event item in my inventory after event period but not gonna let me use/delete it.And I think some killers are OP such as THE DOCTOR his ''electric ability'' cover the whole map sometimes and the effects on survivor never fade out no matter what you do.
0;A game that started off as a load of fun now an empty husk of what it was met some great people and had a lot of laughs but after all the 'balancing' the game is incredibly tedious and a sad mess of toxicity not to mention the the devs and their habit of breaking that didnt need touching recent nerf to leader has proven the devs for sure have iq's in the negatives cannot wait to uninstall ) basically avoid if you dont hate yourself
0;After play game for a while i found many problem.1. stuck in loading screen. (first initailized)2. after play 1 or 2 game and find new lobby game stuck at loading screen with no progress bar.3. in game nearly end ( last servivor i'm playing as killer) game crash. (face this many times)4. after playing for 3 5 minutes game crash. (face this many times)this game are 10 bucks but have 10 million bugs....
0;To keep it short... This game is probably the worst possible experience you can have with video games.it's such a godawful game the devs should honestly be ashamed of themselves for what they've done. It's a waste of my time and yours. Terrible game. Never consider it at all.
0;dont buy that game it sucks i asked friendly if i can get a second chance ( i cheated me legacy 2 and 3 ) and i got perma banned and now i asked after 2 years if i can get a chance i sayed you guys can reset my account i accpet it but they saying ever the same thing.... i hate these stupid supporter....
0;Bug .. PRETTY GOOD JUB AS ... Cant drop pallet when is killer in bug with dead hard bug with pallets On EUROPE playing with ASIAN players or AMERICA PING 200+ / 300+ Hackers with speed hack / Lag hack Bad job so far Good game ( Maybe 5 months back ) PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME AND DONT ADD KILLERS THX
0;only fun way to play as killer is to go as lvl1 killer with nothing equiped vs 4 lvl 50 full equiped survival. Only fun way to play survival is to play with premates. Balancing is absolut in this game. Possibility how to play is very limited. Map design is average. Hope there will be a fix to this
0;It would be a good gamed if it were balanced but because the devs change how most aspects work with every update it's not worth buying. the game is usually broken as hell and gets worse with every new killer/survivor.Ps The bugs that are in the game get fixed a year after they are discorvered by players.
0;Lost my progress.Got 156 000 000 in game currency (bloodpoints) refunded to me.I should've got more like 200 million.Lost my Legacy exclusives. Game is very unbalanced and is repetitive as killer.Game can also be boring for survivors if you go against a killer that knows how to use BL and tunnels and facecamps you or if you go against a Nurse.
0;Odds stacked against most killers and especially on one map. No option to try out new killer without being harassed. Still a orginal game that created a new genre. Recommended more for survivors than for Killers. Considerable bugs after some updates ike the game suddenly thinking game files have been hacked.Spending any money on the game as survivor is something that should be given thought as there are two DLC kIllers that will just lock down the game and make it nearly unwinnnable for you.
0;This is a definitely fresh and attractive game. However I have questioned developer's balancing and bug fixing. As the bugs are fixed more new bugs might be met. Plus between survivors and killers among killers game balance is not going better. The developers recognize OP play but they DO NOT have plan to fix. It might bring you many stresses. You need inner peace when playing the game.
0;I use to have a lot of fun on this game. With or without friends. I stopped playing for a good eight months because I got bored of it and the community was just toxic all around. Sad to say same boring game eight months later. the community has gotten a little better However I do not think this game is worth the time to play.
0;Very asymmetrical based a lot on skills and trolling.Communication is key and this game does not have that.Does not have pretty graphics and has some bugs.Not fun with less than 4 survivors.Not fun with troll / lagged / obsessive / camper killer neither with troll / lagged / ragequitter survivors.
0;This game is the funniest joke of 2019. This turd cant even load in 5 players good luck getting a full match. No patches for a month fixing issues but have no problem releasing new dlc or shop items.And if you do get a full match enjoy the facecamp and tunnel mode 5000. And a toxic after game lobby. 1/1000000
0;This game is so eerygame I go in has a killer with NoED a facecamping myers a leatherface or a doctor with OP perks and Ad ons this game is so the community is toxic every killer that I go against brong NoED and I ing hate this game so ing much can't wait for the ability to do gens in 15 sec with the new leader buff. killers they are so ing OP.
0;I used to like this game but now it just crashes. A lot. It's not even every other game it's more often than that. I have to keep alt tabbing and closing the game through task manager. There are many threads about this on the forum but no mention has been made about it by the devs.Buying this game as is is a gamble. It may crash on you more often than not or it may not. Ultimately it's your money to gamble but I wouldn't get it as is.It's a shame.
0;If I had not met my wife on this game theres no way I would have sunk a total of 83 days of my life into this...... women make you do crazy boys. Game is a shell of its former self completely gutted of everything fun. I'll never forget the days of old when I would play for 12 hours straight with a full 4 man. Too bad its not fun to play survivor at all anymore because every killer tunnels and camps. Devs are and have no idea what they're doing.
0;"""Running on an i5 7500k and a 4GB VRAM AMD 560 Pro with 8GB RAM and when i join a game i get stuck on the loading screen and it said """"Not Responding"""" and BETA was much better since it had fast loading screens. So don't buy this game even though you have a decent PC. And the devs will not probably respond to this comment because they only need ideas from people who ask to add """"this"""" and """"that"""" into the game without even fixing it."""
0;Huge potential and great concept. Unfortunatelly not finished. It is plagued by bugs many game breaking bugs.I played 80 hours. During this time all bugs were slowly building up to the point I can't progress with the game anymore. Terrible state. Don't buy it now wait at least 6 months.
0;"""Multiplayer is sucking a** right now i can't even play with my friends without having problems with """"connection"""" (my internet is fine) and a lot of people are having the same disconnection problem....I can't even enter a matchmaking session there's always a error related to that..."""
0;Fun when it works.Very poor quality console port. Multiplayer is broken most of the time.Denuvo and anti tamper eat up your CPU. There are hundreds of checks being done whenever you do actions in the game as part of the DRM. On top of that the terrible texture resolution is really disappointing. No HD texture pack being offered is garbage.Performance is 30 40% worse than games with similar visual fidelity. Other games with better graphics also run better than this does.
0;Even with revision 152771 that claim to fix disconnection issues the problem remain. Since launch not a single day pass without me or one of my friends disconnecting mid game at least once. It is pretty ridiculous seeing that no other online games that I play exhibit such an issue. Other than that the game is not well optimized but runs well on my rig. While the single player experience is great multiplayer is one of the game's main selling point I can not recommend it at its current state.
0;Not worth it until they fix the following 1. No raw mouse input the game implements the mouse as a joystick2. No way to disable motion blur and depth of field3. Clunky multiplayer requires each member to have watch the mission's cutscenes beforehand4. No way to exit the game during a mission you have to abandon first (c'mon it's 2018)5. Denuvo DRMOther irritating stuff 1. Really bad clipping2. Silent protagonist style3. Limited voiceovers and reaaally bad dubbing4. Walls of text everywhere
0;What were they thinking with this multiplayer system?They had a perfectly fine way to handle online questing. This is frustrating trying to play with friends.Don't play this for the multiplayer which is one of the big draws for the game in the first place...
0;THIS GAME IS BASSICALY UNPLAYABLE FOR MULTIPLAYER.Game wise this game is good very fun. The problem is ME AND MY FRIENDS CANNOT PLAY THIS GAME AT ALL without someone disconnecting every 10 mins. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT THE CURRENT STATE unless you are playing this game for single player SOO ANNOYING.
0;pc players waited 6 months because they where filling the game with denuvo and nothing else no optimitation or pc setting you would expectbeat this in about 40 hours never played a monter hunter before but i dont think there ment to be this shortmultiplayer dosnt workno contentevents are and give you nothinggo play Pso2 its free and way more content and cooler boss fights japanese version ofcourse

0;I have about 100hrs in the game with my friend and but I'm pretty sure about 40hrs of those are lost due to disconnecting and restarting the quests. After all these dcs I've finally managed to play the post game only to have someone dc at the start of the first 60seconds of the 1st quest. Actual trash game DON'T BUY THIS if you're trying to play mutliplayer you'll actually have ptsd everytime you try to play any multiplayer game.
0;The game constantly disconnects and it's near impossible to play co op with others. It's frustruating fighting a monster just to dc and are either forced to leave or try to kill a hp boosted monster that takes forever. The main reason I got this game was to play with my friends but most of the time i find myself soloing most things as it's too frustruating constantly dcing.Also how do you release a game on pc without proper kb mouse controls? Capcom pls.
0;Fun game i've been waiting for a monster hunter game on pc for ages. It seemed to play well on my system. I had to refund it though because I kept getting connection errors. For the price i don't want to play a 50+ hour game solo. I have other games for that kind of experience. Might pick it up again when its on a big sale and when the issues have been addressed.
0;FIX THE GOD D.!AMN SEVER ISSUE !!!It is almost impossible to play with friends and even multiplayer !!!I bought this game for $60 but I don't think you guys provide service to users enough.If you guys keep providing game service like this (including server issue).It doesn't need to be $60.This game is good enough and fun but you guys' service makes me annoyed so much.
0;Thumbs down till they fix the communtication error BS. I should be able to play with my friends and yet every hunt i get in i end up getting kicked into a solo hunt while the monster keeps its multiplayer bonus. This is stupid Can't believe i'm saying this but the PS4 version is better. Never had these communtication errors on the PS4. I'm done playing this game till they fix this issue.
0;The game's amazing but the connection issues are blatant and I'm not kidding when I say that you'll disconnect literally every 10 minutes if not more often. It's insane how impossible it is to play with friends. If you like playing solo Monster Hunter then by all means buy this game but if you planned on even two manning anything this is not the game for you.
0;This you need to know There is So much fail to connect in this game I can never get to play with my friends session. Its so funny that since the game came out in console this problem been here.. If i was you in never waste $60 on this wait till it goes on sale..

0;50 hours played. The game play is fun but online at the moment does not work. Don't buy this game until they fix their network/server issues. UI is also atroucious but you can get used to it. You will fight with the UI and it does not make sense but it works I guess.

Yes. But the quality of connection is too unstable to ruined the experience of this game mate.So just JUST FIX THESE PAINFUL PROBLEMS okay?And sorry about my language."""
0;As a P2/P2G/P3 player it remains to be seen whether the gameplay is solid or masterpiece.No performance issue so far.

0;I am not going to change this review even if this get fixed. 7 months into refining the PC port and i cannot stay connected for more than 5 minutes in any multiplayer session not even with friends. I currently regret not refunding the game right away instead of trying to solve the problem on my own. This is something that shouldn't ever happen especially on a triple A game in 2018.
0;Pre ordered the game should have come with 2 DLCsDidn't get eithr of them they show up in my purchase history Game runs pretty horrible on minimum graphics settings multiple friends say the same.Playing with friends is a pain to do not only because of the awkward system but because of the connection issues as well.Game crashes quite often and doesn't keep your progress if it does.Edit Found out why the DLC's weren t there i had to tick the checkmarks on them under the DLCs section of the game

0;"""Game itself is Fun to play.However there are 2 main problems.1. Frequent Disconnection Fix it. You made enough money within 3 days. It's time to fix your server.2. Hack/Trainer Ban it.These players are simply killing all the new players' enjoyable moments on online mode.And you achieved my one vote """"I do not recommend this game"""" until you fix these issues."""
0;Great game with glaring issues. Connection issues fix the tabbing issues support wide screen 8 monthes extra to throw together a messy port.I'd love to give it a good rating to support future PC versions of MH but if they're of this quality I'd rather play them on my hand helds.I'll reccommend it once the issues that would be resolved within the first week of launch in any other game are fixed.
0;* No 4k Check* Derpnuvo Check* No PS4 button layout Check* No HDR Check* No Ultra Wide Screen CheckI'm only happy because it is on PC and I dont have to fireup my Potato Station 4 to play this. That and on SSD it loads almost instantaneously.As it stands right now I do not recommend this game. Wait for sale price.
0;"""If you're a fan of Skyrims radiant """"murder the gang leader"""" quests that's all this game is.Combat is repetitive and boring. Large monsters consist of two types Those that run away every 2 minutes of combat.Those that jump you while you're chasing the above. Crafting and smithing are uncreative and underwhelming.Weapon and armor designs are either good looking or are good gear but never both.Mei from overwatch guest stars as your partner so that's something I guess"""
0;Seven months of waiting. Bad optimization. Didn't include any content update console received since launch. Ultra graphic setting equals to console graphics No 21 9 support in 2018. Still charge you at full price.Don't buy this game on PC if you already have a console. Campom don't deserve your money.
0;I am a huge fan of Monster Hunter through the ages. Having played since gen1. This game is a huge step forward for the series. However Capcom several months after release still haven't fixed the rampant connection issues with the game. Which is a huge issue for a game where you fight a monster for 30 40 minutes just to drop from a well coordianted group and lose everything since the fight is designed to be handled by multiple people. (arch tempered dragons)
0;Game is fine if you dicide to be a lonewolf in MHW. the multiplayer mode is a TOTAL SHXT my crew and me always got disconect from sessions and went to offline mode sometimes you could rejoin the session and rejoin the quest through SOS but its really annoying and you cant rejoin the session if the host disconnect.
0;DO NOT PURCHASE IF You want to play mouse/keyboardYou want to play with friendsYou want a clean easy to navigate experienceDO PURCHASE IF You can put up with laggy garbage inputYou love dealing with convoluted unbindable keysYou love dealing with a console game ported to PC with nothing useful for PC play added
0;The game falls to a lot of red flags when it comes to gaming unskippable cutscenes with extremely boring and subpar story highly marketed multiplayer locked behind said cutscenes most viable builds involve wearing clowsuits with no chance of good armor or weapon transmogrificationThese issues alone make the game a no go zone. You're better off playing an older iteration of MonHun like 4 Ultimate than this.
0;"""Yeah you can't have """"world"""" in the title with a co op system this convoluted taking seven windows to navigate. Constant offline disconnects mid mission on both sides which leaves you alone with a buffed monster. I hear co op is almost as bad on PS4 which begs the question how low are PS4 player standards to give this a good review?"""
0;"""""""You have lost connection""""You will see this every single time you try and play co op with anyone in this game I cannot finish a single game with friends who are in the same room . """"We want to take our time to optimize MH World for PC""""This game runs like crap and stutters on my 1080 16GB of RAM and Ryzen 7 PCThe game is fantastic WHEN IT WORKS Which at this point is never stay far away until this gets fixed."""
0;Honestly I bought this game just to play with my friends but I'm constantly getting disconnect errors and it's completely ruining my experience of the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who plans on playing multiplayer. Single player is alright but multiplayer is where it shines.... if you could stay connected.
0;Online features suck as when you try to play with friends. Blocking you out of missions if they player hasn't seen certain cutscenes and It is a random match singleplayer game advertised as a multiplayer game? They just ed up online features too much I would stay away if that is the thing that interests you. At least until they fix all the t.
0;As a big monster hunter fan I can't recommend this version at the moment.I played the PS4 version which already had connection problems for 200 hours and now they present us with this.The SOS System is not working for 85% of the day because the servers don't work.The performance is horrible and sinks to sub 20 fps in fights against elder dragons becauseof the particle effects.I would only recomend this game if you don't care about the frame drops and want to play solo at the moment.
0;Constant disconnects. The servers are absolute garbage. Another issue is ERR 12 Graphics device has crashed. I'm running an overclocked 1080. Every time this error occurs I lose all progress since last save. Fix your game it could be GOTY but not in this state. Also why does a 2018 game run at a maximum of 60fps on my $4000 pc? It's a joke and I really wish it wasn't.
0;I would 100% recommend this game if the latest patch didn't cause crash on startup.Anyway play it if you like ARPGs. Fantastic rewarding combat cool exploration mechanics lots of play value etcetc.Biggest flaw is its endgame content. Endgame can be reached a little too soon (there's also some filler content) and there's not much to do besides throw yourself at RNGesus's feet every 5 10 minutes.
0;Joins online session starts nergigante with friends to farm for materials difficulty adjusted for a full party of 4 players eats food and is hyped for the battle. Unsheathes weapon Error 5038f MW1Aaaaand you have to deal with a 4 hunter difficulty Nergigante or you can abandon the quest and the whole cycle repeats. Your choice.
0;Why? Why sell a port to PC and it's NOT to our standards of FINISHED PRODUCT. Faith in game companies are on a downward decline...why is that? When your wallet is making your choices of game development you get a game like this. No gamepad control scheme hard to co op and disconnects like a boss. Can I get HALF MY MONEY BACK and when you FINISH THE GAME you get the rest. Seems fair.
0;"""Until this game stops with the random disconnects I'm gonna have to put this as a """"Do Not Purchase"""".Compared to the previous Monster Hunter games this version ball and chains you to story missions instead of letting the player run free to join their friends on missions.Along with that why is there no """"Skip"""" button on Cut Scenes? Lastly the game doesn't feel well optomized.I'm running an i5 4690 with 32gbs of RAM and a GTX 980 and I'm still getting massive frame rate drops at LOW."""
0;This game seems to be never optimized. The terrible frame rate and annoying crashing problems stopped me being quite a fan of MH from leaving a positive comment. Also runing this game seems a kind of torture to my CPU.If you are someone who evaluates the graphic performance probably you need to think twice before purchasing this god damn game.
0;I've been playing this game for 19 hours and I can't play with my friends for even once. Always been that connection error. I can't believe I pre order this crap. If it is not finished just don't sell it in the market. This is the worst purchasing I have ever made.
0;Right now I stop playing this game because the stutter problem once you reach the Elder's Reccess makes the game unplayeble. My main issue is the lightning particles that drop my fps counter to 10 15 constantly. The bad general optimization conection errors and a thousand of specifics errors are the main facts to wait and dont buy the game.Just be patience.
0;"The delays are killing this game and making it unplayble. I am only getting items into my inventory 2 3 secs after having done so I am getting hit and killed 2 3 secs after being behind cover. It became worse since the latest updates. If you have a test server why put this turd on the ""Stable"" one. Are you that wise?!"
0;FIX THE DAMN CONNECTION PROBLEMS ALREADY? are you serious?????? I join a game 4 versus a Xeno'jiva start attacking it.... everythings fine then boom connection problem 3 dudes disconnect AT LEAST MAKE IT SO THE MONSTERs DAMN HP GOES BACK DOWN TO a 1 PLAYER VARIENT like i mean seriously???? you want someone to sit there for 5 hours killing a monsteR?????? fix your damn game jeez.
0;If only this game has a standalone server and dun depend on steam New UI up all our game with connection issues Monster Hunter World shud change to Monster Hunter Solo till they even fix this br&gt Overall nice game if u wanna play single player for now but thumbs down till they fix the connection
0;"""Great if you don't mind surviving and bashing up bigger and bigger monsters challenging yourself to bash them with a of assorted weapons tools potions and other gadgets on a """"could be better optimised"""" game. Cross your fingers and hope the devs better work on optimisation better networking more monster variety and mod support? probably not mod support would be good though.Voting no to starve off the staggering praise for it."""
0;The game is good I'm happy to play it... BUT ther's so much to improve. bad FPS bad GPU utilization bad monsters (NPC) moves bad hitboxes bad servers stability (crashes for no reasons.) good gameplay (exept the things I said up here) fun to play with friends big maps many monsters many weapons/setsnot a bad game in general but the things that needs to be fixed are many and are so annoying.
0;The only people who call this game a good PC port are the ones with high end maxed out gaming rigs. Trust me it isn't well optimized at all. If you can deal with that and the fps drops the game is fine and fun though. So yeah I recommend the game itself just maybe not the PC version unless you have a beast rig the minimum requirements are very misleading(you gonna need more)
0;frequently DC 5 minutes into the game and DC everytime! Might as well remove the Multi player tag from the game(2/9 update)Heard that you fixed the connection. Nice ing error code 83 game disconnected mid game so I have to fight the monster alone with multiplayer diffcult alone! Have to abandon the game and that happened quite a lot! Serious wtf
0;I can't recommend this game until they fix the constant disconnects from public games. This game is grindy enough without constantly wasting hours due to a sudden disconnect. Everything else stays connected. Only MHW disconnects. Other games I play never have this issue.
0;Hey want a game with good developers that work on the issues their game has? Then keep looking this is not the game you are looking for. 2 weeks after release and not a single update has come out and doubtfully will. There are bunches of bugs posted daily in their discussion board. Guess what though. . . . THE DEVS DO NOT RESPOND TO THEM. This should be a great game but the people behind it suck.
0;"""Don't buy this title if you intend to hunt with your friends. I tried so many ways and get around for the constant """"disconnection/Error 83 MW1"""". But to no avail. This is just another solo player game.And i feel that the controls for keyboard and mouse are not optimise which kinda forces users to get a gamepad and play on it instead. REALLY REALLY disapointed in CAPCOM for this port over."""
0;I enjoyed my initial playthrough of this game however the end game consists of grinding investigations for decorations with a 0.4% chance to drop and to complete certain builds you'll need several of these rare decorations. This type of uninspired lazy game design needs to be a thing of the past. If you like grind you may like this game.
0;Game corrupted my save file and wont even lunch anymore. Fix your capcom.Update Managed to repair the game made a new save file and drag my to the final boss again game corrupt my save file AGAIN. This is unacceptable capcom! FIX YOUR ING GAMEUpdate2 it's now january and the save file problem as not been fixed yet...
0;Great game with awful customer treatment Developer that doesn t care for the player base Months Behind on content 8 months Behind on release Parity / with worst graphics quatily than consoles Lack of communication Full price Server are garbage DenuvoHonestly if you have patient just hold on for the crack... Dont support crapcom as developer...Sadly I did...
0;TLDR Version.Storyline is great.Gameplay great.Endgame just ends up being a lottery.You take a pull and hope for the best but the house always wins.I've killed literally over a hundred elder dragons and having nothing to show for it.I'm sure more people put in more time but I'm leaving this alone.Don't mind the grind however this is just unrewarding in the end.
0;So really good game. I've put almost 100 hours into it and still haven't completed all the quests they've given me though I did finish the main story (also took a long time). I would give the game a thumbs up if it was possible for me to access the multiplayer content but everytime I've tried it kicks me after about 15 minutes with an error message. As far as solo content goes still a solid game with a ton of variety. Just be careful if you're only getting it for the coop gameplay.
0;Game is fun and beautiful... WHEN IT WORKS.Constant crashing during grinding sessions and even multiplayer is extremely annoying.Paid extra for the bundled edition of the game. AAA game with an AAA price tag but results feel like it's supposed to be in Beta.Until the crashes are fixed I cannot recommend this game at its current price tag.
0;"""Game is good. Port is real bad and poorly optimized for PCs. The """"big patch"""" came one month later and didn't fix that much for me game still runs like and somehow I have more connection issues now than before where everything gets frozen and then kicks everyone out of online mode."""
0;this game is good but have server problem....this what i means by server problem.... when join friend session im always disconnect when communication error pop up....pls fix itits not happen only for me...its happen to all my friend and i think other player as welli really enjoy the game but with this problem maybe i will not enjoy for long...sorry for my bad english
0;Its not half as good as people make it out.Several design choices are absolutely baffling.The story is cringe worthy and there's no option to skip at all.The first half hour of the game is a complete waste of time.You can't mute NPCs regardless of how irritating they are.Cat companions Why? Just why. There's no violence at all.Virtually every weapon looks rediculous. Coop is integrated beyond poorly.Maybe there's a fun game buried beneath the frustration.But to be blunt.I just don't care.
0;Some people are reversing their decisions to give this a negative review. I will not be doing so because the servers are in fact NOT fixed. Better and fixed are different. Disconnections are still a daily occurence. And honestly? Considering they sold 10 million copies I think its pure laziness on their part. They made their money they're done. They COULD outsource it for a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions in profit they made but I doubt they will.
0;If it wasn't for the fact that you disconnect from online sessions every 5 minutes I would recommend this game. It's not a multiplayer game if it's almost entirely missing the multiplayer component. The disconnection issues has been present since the day it launched and it's still not fixed. Nearly every review complains about the disconnects as well so... just be aware of what you're buying.
0;The game is still buggy if you're okay with that go for it.But don't be shocked if something bizarre like fullscreen refusing to work 100 hours in happens like it happened to me. These random problems have happened to friends too. I'm an MH veteran and I can't believe Capcom released this game in such a buggy state on PC and refuses to fix all the issues. People say its fine now but there are still connectivity issues resolutions issues the game freezes sometimes temporarily etc..
0;This game is pure trash.Koreans learn how to develop games. You are just untalented developersThe Battle Royale Genre as of the end of 2018 is oversaturated with titlesThis one started all but never got to the point of getting to be a decent one buying this game is like throwing your money away..There are just better shooters out there today.
0;I play the game on a GTX 1060 6GB OC and an i5 6600 OC to 3.5mhz and still can't have stable fps with only the rendering setting on high (1080p). In fights like Teostra when she/he does a big AOE attack i go below 30fps. The nvidia pannel is set on performance btw. I hope they will do something about this cuz the game is so much fun my 100h on it says it all.
0;Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Thunder DROPS FPS and thunder element only. Why? I dont know.Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Keyboard and Mouse controllers are utter Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Random FPS drops!!Disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.Servers constantly disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect disconnect.
0;For a series that's had a huge focus on multiplayer and cooperation the current state of MHW is simply not worth buying at all. Even if you only want the game as a single player experience the amount of content in the game is simply not worth the price tag.
0;After 100+ Hours of playing this game. It is pretty fun to be honest. BUT the crashing and disconnecting issues me the fk off. I was killing the ancient dragon to get my matierials for 2 days! After that I got the matierial i want last round and it crashed. But because it didnt save yet and means that i wasted my time and the matierials gone. And the aim assist system for bow is suck. and cant disable too Thanks for crashing the game. SO MUCH FUN )
0;I can't really recommend this game they already have a lot of dlc now thats is pretty much usless and still they charge you for it even though the game has issues. If you dont have a decently beefy computer good luck in the rotten vale biome because I have a fx 6300 cpu and nvidia 1050 ti which is a bit above minimum and still lag horrible on rotten vale.becareful before you buy this do your research.
0;First Monster hunter series that I am playing and it is SUPER great! I wish I could play it all day long. Online sucks like BIG TIME! Game is not optimized for PC hope that patches and fixes comes soon since it is way much better to play with friends!
0;The problems this game has have been present since the beginning and have not been fixed for no reason.they include bad netcode lag terrible deathcams so disjointed from what actually happened they might as well not exsist Bugs that seem quirky at first but now seem lazy.and more.What made pubg so popular was the potential it had but what has led to its decline in players and terrible reviews is the game in didnt life up too.
0;Don't buy this game on PC unless it's the only platform you own that can run it. The extra performance is not worth losing out on all the content that only consoles have.Capcom promised that PC players would get that content at an accelerated rate to catch up but that turned out to be a boldfaced lie we're actually getting it slower.I recommend the game just not for PC unless they drastically increase the rate of content updates.
0;Previous MH games average total monster count 100 (70 big 30 small)MHW (latest console version) 52 (34 big and 18 small)Only 5 locations. They haven't added new one since console launch 9 month ago and probably never will.Whole storyline can be fully covered in one sentence.As mh veteran I'm disappointed in content amount.P.S. My 200 hours contain lots of afk grind for tempered footsteps.
0;The gameplay in this game great and it still feels like classic monster hunter to me but the fact is this game has cause two blue screens of death and multiple crashes on a fairly high end system that I've done all the updates for. (at 1080p) So until this stops I cannot recommend buy this game in this state.
0;"""Feels like playing a beta ... even with solo gameplay working. It's just sad that something like that happens with a 60 title /There was so... sooo much time to work out how to get multiplayer working on PC but no.Just let the customer pay and suck it.That's really not how you should treat your Customers!Please remove Co op / Multiplayer from the game description because it's """"effectivly"""" not implemented. *sigh*"""
0;CAPCOM sucks badly never liked them and never will...This game very very annoying and ALT F4 isn't working WARNING!If your target monster wont kill you then Bazelgeuse will its the most annoying monster in the gaming world making this unbearable on higher levels of the game and seriously damage the user and my experience.
0;Game is a lot of fun Even more so early on. Later in the game you will notice the performence hits more and more. Current drivers for nvidia useally make the fps hits worse and it does not seem like capcom is able to fix the performence issues for awhile
0;Great game but does not run well at all on my 1080ti. Certain areas are unplayable since last patch and some monsters special attacks still make my game go below 25 frames. If you are not very passionate about mh in general you will definetly not have a good time because the game runs like absolute trash. Good optimization!
0;So I absolutely love this game and I have a lot of fun playing it but the pc port is janky and bad. The ps4 had trouble when it launched but those issues were quickly fixed. Its ridiculous how much the pc port kicks me from online and its ruined so many hunts in game that I'm honestly just sick and tired of it. I'll change this review when and if the connection issues are fixed but its been a while since the pc port launched so I rather doubt the issues will be fixed.
0;There has virtually never been a time that I've played the game for longer than an hour stretch where I haven't disconnected. The UI is not PC friendly in the slightest and even after logging hundreds of hours on this game and enjoying some aspects of it its faults outweight its positive attributes. This game is clearly a haphazard console to PC port avoid on this PC if you have the option.
0;The recent Kulve update introduced hitching and frametime spikes to the game and capcom refuses to acknowledge it.There have been multiple threads about this problem but they either die out or are ignored.Thread showing the problem https //steamcommunity.com/app/582010/discussions/3/2805074491019538041/ untill this gets fixed this review will stay as not recommended.
0;1. Buy this game if u want to play it solo because it is a ton of fun and the combat is engaging even the grind is fun imo because its just boss fight after boss fight.2. however dont buy this game if u want to play multiplayer or with your friends it is incredibly annoying the amount of disconnects you get from sos flares and from groups in general i join sos flares to not have to play solo and get dced probably 75 % of the time awesome game probably the worse servers i ever played on.
0;you cant play story missions with friends which means you can only side quest with them which is super disapointing. And if by some miracle you do get a friend or some other people in you'll most likely disconnect halfway through a fight because the servers are so awful.
0;Fun game enjoyed it until endgame where my min max side and fashion side collide between wanting to deal massive damage and looking like a clown and doing damage and looking like a beast bow gun min max armor is atrocious I absolutely hate the colorful yoga pants it makes me wear
0;I'll change my review when Capcom can get their together here. The game is horribly optimized for PC. For some people it's unplayable. Major FPS issues when fighting certain monsters and after the latest update my game will have periodic freezing which ruins the gameplay. I'm sure after a time this game will be a great addition to any PC library. But for now its utter trash.
0;It's a great game to play overall. The textures are mostly good the enemies can be fun to fight but it doesn't matter if you constantly DC/ the people youre playing with DC. Connection has been a constant issue throughout launch. Also why the is there so much trivial DLC? You have to pay almost $90 on top of the $60 base game so have fun shelling $150+ ( because knowing capcom they'll add more DLC later on costing more money.) just to have the entire game.
0;Great game terrible online/server connection.Everytime I queue up with a group of people or join them I get kicked out when I am halfway done with the mission. I have no problem solo ing monsters but I prefer to group up so I can finish missions faster. They need to fix this damn issue.
0;"""After one week this game has completely stopped launching for me!!!!! I have been dealing with capcom tech support for a week and the havent given me any advice better than """"restart your computer"""". Whats worse is that steam will not refund me because i intially played more than 2 hours before it stopped working. IT WILL NO LONGER LAUNCH AT ALL!!!! I recommend waiting until this thing gets patched a whole lot more before buying."""
0;good game at first just a shame about all the dam bugs etc so annoying that eventually u stop playing patch tommorow and there more concern about adding another monster than fixing the game says it all would only buy the game when they have fixed all the dont make the same mistake i did to be then
0;game is good game for ps4 only. please don't buy pc version.1 very bad performance issue unless you have a very expensive pc 2 didn't support ultra wide resolusion 3 delay every dlc already on ps4 for no reason if capcom think pc gamer is not important as ps4 gamer why we bother buy you game?fxxk re2 and dmc5
0;"""This isn't a review but just a heads up to anyone who's considering to get this for the multiplayer aspect of the game. Constant disconnects be it your own mission or someone else's. It's a joke that that you and your friends cannot progress together on missions that have cutscenes if you do want to join them you have to complete the mission prior to actually being able to """"co op"""" with them. What is the point of it in this case?"""
0;Monster Hunter World Developers you have to make things right for the multiplayer feature you're making us cringe because of the occasional disconnetions it ruin the games of most of us especially during quests where more players are needed. We are not happy about this issue. Perhaps more will come and enjoy if you can fix this. Please focus more on your problems carefully as this is not a cheap paid game. Thank you
0;i waste my money on this... I really hope i can get a refund... You see the game itself is great.. But the connection are terrible.. Now is a winter fest and because of the stupid error code something something i never actually get a chance to play it.. Write a number of e mail to capcom none response.. FML.
0;Seemed very repetitive. Killing a ton of bosses seemed like a pretty cool concept buts its all the same after a while and that's not counting the rehashing of mission with the same bosses and reskinning of the same bosses and giving them different names. Drop aren't even that worthwhile. Sure you should always upgrade your gear but they don't seem to make too much of a difference. You can run through a good portion of missions until you actually need to get new gear.
0;I have been play Monster hunter for a longtime about 3000 hr. Pro Good CG compare to same series Seemless map Con Not good CG compare to 2018 other game Use too much CPU GPU Game too easy for Old player Less Weapon Less customizeAnd Varyyyyyyyy Bad Multiplayer always fail connection and error nearly all the time
0;I am personnally totally disappointed by the rate of updates and the Capcom who ate their promise currently I don't recommend any attempt to purchase PC version and even more any version of Monster Hunter World until Capcom keep their promise and do some actual work on this game.
0;They had over a year to port this game to PC and they bring this. The game looks really bad textures are bad even on High and I have to play with black bars because no 21 9 support.. in 2018. I have a lot of japan console ports but no doubt this is the worst one.
0;*sigh* I guess I have to put out my review on the disconnecting issue. The game is beautiful don't get me wrong. The only issue that disrupts the fun of it all is the constant disconnects ruining the experience because there is no way to go back into the instance. The scaling for the monster even persists and doesn't compensate for the number of players on the field.I'm holding this review as a negative until this is fixed. The game is fine otherwise.
0;Don't waste your moneyThe gameplay is awful. The controls are super unresponsive making the combat unplayable. Graphics are years behind other games. Multiplayer function is basically non existant due to disconnection problem.Bunch of bugs and broken game machenics that Capcom continues to ignore. Overall just an all hype this game is a joke. The negative reviews are true. Save your self the money and frustration.
0;Kill monster get parts upgrade gear. Kill monster get parts upgrade gear. Over and over and over....Kinda like d3. Then once you complete the story mode you kill monsters that look just like the ones you just killed but colored differently. Ugh....If the game didn't start out with a long story and more time in to playing right off the get go I wouldn't have wasted 60.00 dollars on this repetitive game.
0;Love this game and series overall. However the recent Kulve Taroth update has been annoying. I'm not annoyed by the RNG but I'm annoyed by the poor optimization of this game. Before the update I been running this game very decently. Now I get random black stutters mid game which is a huge eyesore. Please optimize your game Capcom...
0;"""Its ok but in comparison to some others it's story is shortlived and it just becomes* constant hunting.There was no real feel put into this game. For a """"New"""" world it's small messy and the AI is horrendous.Feels like a step down from even the PSP releases and for a PC first? I'm kind of let down when Monster Hunter Online was supposed to be International and instead capcom releases this.No long supporting capcom over this and their awful PR."""
0;Nearly three months after the PC release the devs have yet to address the glaring issues re the game defaulting to the low resolution textures lack of ultrawide support etc. With each new monster release on the PC it becomes less and less likely the devs will actually address the glaring issues in the PC version.
0;Before the game released on steam it's said that the PC version will keep pace with PS4. And now PC version is far hehind PS4 and we have to wait for Kulve Taroth until early November? Why do we have to wait more time for existed content? Great job Crapcom. My friends and me AFK because there is no content to play with.This is my only negative review on steam. and I'll change it to positive if Crapcom updates PC version slightly more frequently for existed content.
0;Bought this game after the long hype of it coming to PC port.I would love to give this game a thumbs up but sadly not yet as I have yet to play with friends in my history of almost 20 hours.So many different connection errors and all were there when it was released half a year ago for PS4 and XBox.Please care for the people who back you guys up and fix this error before you lose your backers
0;the game is need more update...dont understand why you need to monster to constantly following each other literally every second and flying monster need to stop flying literally every 10 mins hope the game fix its problems soon other then that the game is bloody good
0;This game has some of the worst connection problems I have ever seen in a multi player game. I have been unable to play with my friends for two weeks now. and we're almost 5 months post PC launch. same error every single time. and literally no communication from Capcom on the issue. If I hadnt enjoyed every other aspect of this game I would have refunded it immediately. but dont reward these people with your money.
0;This game is awesome but all the issues just makes it unplayable. Everytime I plug in my controller to play it either freezes or just doesn't even detect my xontroller. Also there is fps issues I get really low fps for no reason. I would recommend this game but not right now until they fix the issues then it's a reccomend.
0;Half a year to not things up and Capcom still manages to ruin it. Cpu manages everything in game while the Gpu sits and eats glue which leads to tons of crashes. Connection issues only make it worse for getting anything done with firends. This cake is also topped with a nice little Denuvo cherry.
0;Not recommended as a totally now player to Monster Hunter. It's way to unfriendly to keyboard users. The UX feels like they come from 90s. They put World in its name not players interaction n bonding is weak. Simulating real life failing from such perspective.
0;This game runs poorly on my i5 4440 gtx 1060 6gb 8gb ram. FPS frequently drops down to 10 20 fps on high setting at 1080p with Volumetric Rendering off. Not to mention constant coop connection errors. To think they needed six months for this lazy port! Way to milk off pc players!
0;I can't recommend this game for PC as it is clearly made for console and little was done to make it PC friendly. If you own a console then yes this game should be fun but as a PC player it's very frustrating that the Dev's couldn't be bothered to make a UI for PC players. How hard can it be to make a drag and drop task bar WOW Ark Rust ETC. but no these guys just left you with console radial wheels and nonsense controls. it makes the game impossible to recommend to friends.
0;Cant connect to anyone for the last 3 months waist of money if u cant even play the game with friends have tryed every so called fix and nothing works. can be online for about 3 min then error code pops up anoiying not being able to play the game u bought .
0;"""Black screen on start up requires me to restart computer to runor Takes 10 minutes to finally bootHow the do you delay releasing this game for months to make sure """"PC version of the game runs smoothly"""" and for this to still happen? HAHAH you capcom."""
0;"""Thats the new lvl of servers and lazyness of japs. U wanna play this game with ur friends or with bunch of randoms? Heheheh glorious weebs servers will not allow u to do this. Oh and also u will annoy people in ur steam friendlist with """" Username IS NOW PLAYING MONSTER HUNTER"""""""
0;Really trying to enjoy this game but I can't even make it to the main menu. Crashes on boot every time. I'll gladly write a better review once I can play this game because I REALLY want to play it. But for now I can't recommend spending money on a game you have to gamble on working.
0;After played awhile I would say I like this game but some of the bugs crashes disconnects too much RNG and the end game which recycle the content again and again are making this game a love and hate situation. I felt capcom are simply not done enough to improve. So I will give a thumbs down until they can fix the end game problem.
0;Way too difficult to control for a game. I like challenges but the controls for this on CPU are stupid. It's not even rewarding. If you like farming one monster for hours to get a gem to upgrade one weapon/ piece of armor to use against two monsters cool. F*ck you if you like solo play though! Once you get to the Elder Dragons you can kiss any sort of fun goodbye. It's a chore...
0;7 month of waiting to deliver this garbage.The game is awesome the porting and more important the server (which was the MAIN reason so to speak while Capcom delayed the game on PC) sucks hard.In its current state I wouldn't definitively reccomend this game and SURELY it doesn't worth anywhere near the 60 bucks these greedy bastards ask.
0;Amazing game but just don't buy this version buy ps4 version instead.300 hours into this game all achievements done. However post game grinding is nothing new. DLC/ update will never catch up to console version new monster/gear kept coming out onto console for us PC players to 'look forward to'. Gameplay is amazing. Exactly a monster hunter game you will ever want but just buy PS4 version for the complete game experience.
0;I enjoy the game a lot but it has serious flaws in multiplayer. The scaling is done poorly and can only scale up. A lot of people leave mid fight when they die once leaving you to battle a scaled up steroid monster alone. Not to mention the trolls who run in just to die a couple of times so everyone gets their 'quest failed' and can try again from scratch. The rest of the game is truly amazing imo. I just can't recommend a $60 multiplayer game with major design flaws in multiplayer...
0;THIS GAME IS AIDS. THIS GAME HAS HAD MY GRAFICS DRIVERS ROLLED BACK TO 3 UPDATES AGO 3 3RD PARTY SOFTWERE SYSTEMS JUST TO GET 30 FRAMES!? THE KEYBORD CONTROLS ARE CLUNCKY AND MADE BY SOME ONE WHO HAD NEVER TUCHED A COMPUTER IN THERE LIFE!!! AFTER ALMOST 200 HOURS OF TELLING MY SELF ITS GOING TO GET BETTER ITS GOING TO GET BETTER ITS GOING TO GET BETTER im done save your money... waited 8 more months longer then consle players and capcom gives a port that runs worse then the dark souls port.
0;Please CapcomI gave you my moneyPatch your god damned gameThose hitboxes are the LAMEST I SAW IN YEARS. Last time I had to deal with such a bad collision system was in another Monster Hunter game but the game engine used back then was really old so I didn't mind that much. We're in 2019 now you can't possibly sell a game which is meant to be skill based where ennemies can damage you by charging FORWARD even if you're BEHIND THEM.If it wasn't for the collisions the game is great.THANKS XOXOXO
0;Very bad port of the game. Hit boxes are not accurate. Control response is extremely hit or miss mostly miss. Be prepared to experience many MANY cheap deaths. It's too bad. There's a lot of potential if only they could clean up the code which they won't. Maybe a remastered version some time in the future? Thumbs way down until then.
0;This game was fun at the beginning but later on is completely ts. Every monster is just so damn strong and they can one shot you no matter how much defence you have (unless is 1000). Our hard farming armors are so useless when fighting those tempered monsters specially devi jho. Its attacks are automatically one shot. Fun game huh.
0;"""""""Oh wow multiplayer!"""" Throughout the week Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error Communication Error .And the number of times i have ing crash in this game is just WOW. Best and worst $85 i have ever spent on Steam."""
0;I really liked this game until yesterday where I lost my entire save game because of a bug with the save game (and no it's not the xeno thing with the media creation tools!!). 89 hours wasted for a HR34 char. I hope there will be a fix in the future then I can recommend the game for sure. But right now I can only recommend to play this game with a daily backup of the save game.
0;Its a great start to the Monster Hunter series especially for PC.The problem is that its gets very repetitive end game and the arch tempered monsters are just the same with more HP/Dmg.The DLC release has gotten better though!The game needs more variety.
0;Game is good port is possibly the worst in history. It runs poorly on a moderate gaming set up and decent on a high end one. However wtf is with having a port with half of the game's content missing. The event on PC are a joke compared to console even though we all paid the same price. I'm
0;Good game but denuvo. Denuvo will always kill performance for NOTHING seriosly tho if your specs are good enough and you can survive some buggyness this is a pretty fun boss rush games got to 7 stars solo...it'd be more fun with friends thoNeither of these links are to the study but they talk about it.https //www.neowin.net/news/eu paid for then suppressed study that says piracy doesnt harm saleshttps //gizmodo.com/the eu suppressed a 300 page study that found piracy do 1818629537

0;bad game it has lost all the spirit of hunting monster its all about making equipment for yourself now.when you see a monster you dont have the feeling used to be the monster are nothing now but a scared little prey.lack of feeling of impact multilateral cooperation balancees sense of purpose. (which used to have in PSP)Loud and bad background music.this game has turn from a 75% hunting experience to a machine that hook on your desires. (or should i say an onlineRPG)?
0;fun and great game but keeps crashing after the kulve update so unless its fixed then i would not recommentd i was so excited when i heard that kulve is coming but just to have the game crash everytime while im loading into the mission is extremely dissapointing.
0;Jesus Capcom have no idea how to run a game on PC.Thousands of new games with their fanstastic game content comes up every week on this platform. It is not your little PS4 CapcomAnd there are couple of bug fix to be called 'The second' instead of NEW WEAPON AND ARMOR SETIt is really necessary to keep the loyal player group with you Capcom. Respect the PC player WHY HOLD THE KEY PART IN YOUR HAND WHEN PLAYERS ARE THIRSTY TO PLAY FOR NEW WEAPON AND ARMOR???? GET FXXKED!
0;after playing 160++ hoursmultiplayer barely functions and when it does you dc in like 10 mins leaving you with a monster that has the hp multiplier and alone.end game farming is 100% RNG. decoration farming is 1000000% based on luckmy recommendation is borrow the game from a friend. not worth the money for essentially a single player game
0;Product received for free. The game should not be played in PC.the company made this for waste our money.This game has a bad conection bad control bad server.Cause you hundred hour of time and pay baack nothing.I highly NOT recommand to all of you guys to play this suck game. this company the server you To the idiot game creator.
0;Grindy trash.Badly paced punitive move sets unpredictable hit boxes scores of enemy moves that interrupt and stun items that don't do what the game tells you they do debuffs that affect you despite immunity and bosses that you can't kill in 50 minutes you can't generate the damage to kill them despite an hour of hunting with the most powerful available weapons.After 120 hours I have had enough frustration.And this is the BEST the franchise has to offer.
0;"""(if HAVE Just wanted to ask if it is possible to have 2 4 ps4s and 3DS (already contacted to the internet) in the same house))Its called LAN (local area network) and it uses Ethernet cables to link directly among each linked source in the network to create a private sessionSo the question is """"does MHW support LAN?""""The answer is probably NO"""
0;if you like spending more time chasing a fight than actually fighting the monster this game is for you.if you like a game to be absolutely lacking in any sense of balance this game is for you.if you want to be in the absolute best gear/setup for the exact fight youre doing but you still want to be one shot at any time from unavoidable damage.... this game is for you.if you like having the other players get dropped from the game EVERY SINGLE MISSION.....
0;Product received for free. I seem to remember paying for Monster Hunter Content not Final Fantasy. I'm honestly dissapointed with this cash grab to get the already chronically anoyying Final Fantasy fan base involved in Monster Hunter. Please Capcom use the money we paid for the game and fix the overwhelming amount of connection issues!
0;This is so stupid ...they put one fuc*in stupid monster in it and it totaly frustrates you no fun at all ruins gameplay and you cant ignor it cos you need parts from it ... missions doesnt appear for that monster. This is my exp. from this game. Not mention convert from Console ...
0;21 9. Capcom ! Seriously ! I have games from 2012 that support this. Get with the program. Ultra wide is fairly common place on high end gaming systems now. Patch this up please. Get with the program. This is a simple issue and a major F up.At this point I can't recommend the game. If there is this simple of a screw up I can't immagine what is waiting for me as we move further into the game. FIX FIX FIX FIX. Get on the 21 9 Capcom. For the love of GOD !!!
0;this game is so so stupid it makes no sense to me. why you need to try so hard to beat the buggy monsters and maps.and the biggest problem is why the monster is getting so much stronger but you. it makes me want to kill myself.i think all this game about is wasting time
0;only good graphics.character status cant increase slow movement. almost instant deatch if meet fast monster like tobi kadachi or nergigante. and damage is not constant sometimes very small damage sometimes isntant death even you have good armor.decent gameplay and often disconnect.
0;Beautiful immersive PC game that tantalizes you with the promise of fast action and intricate choreography then slaps you in the with an unusable PC interface. See that 1/4 second opening and know exactly what to do wtih it? Great now try to hit the 7 keystrokes with animated menu delays required to pull it off before the window closes. If it can't be played effectively with a keyboard and mouse it doesn't belong in the PC library.
0;If u want too play for a good maybe 10 hour before hit Negriante then have fun. BUT if u want to get stuck forever keep play after reach the Negriante fight. I have been stuck on this STUPID idiot for since I have been at the mission. I claw and peck my way too him low health still.... One shot. Fly up slam I die. One shot. After hours of mining ores collecting materials I still can not ever kill not a ONE time....
0;Ower Hyped t I don't understad why all the positive reviews on youtube.They just make you fight with T rex in a very small space i'ts not fun just anoyng. The grind in this game is sheet fight a monster for 30 min only to get fainted by the bullsheet one it K.O the fight him again. DONT BUY save your money
0;Don't Buy this game if you dont want to waste your time and money this game is t .. Teostra so OP ing mother er to much damage even thou u have fire Reses. and a High rank 90 up.. Just Don't buy this game .. This Game is a TRASH no HP bar the enemy Plus high Damage even u just Kick hafl of your Hp is Gone Stupid
0;Bugged textures graphical details like stars missing in the night sky and water reflections bugged. Capcom has yet to even acknowledge these listed graphical issues. The game is also a trash port that can't even reach parity graphical setting to the console version. Game also doesn't receive the content updates console get no summer events no autumn/holloween events. Seems the pc version was released just to be released.
0;They need to fix the server issue ASAP can't believe publishing game in this conditionwe all diss other game companies for bad coding and quality but this is like giving you great game with broken key functionwhich make you evem more angry because the game is great
0;Although the game is great the multiplayer has been a very big letdown. I have logged well over 266 hours between PC and PS4 so I do enjoy the game immensely. If capcom can fix connectivity issues with the game I would be glad too revert my negative review but its safe too say stay away until they fix the connectivity issues if multiplayer is the only thing you are looking towards
0;I love the game and concept but for how high profile it is it makes some of the weirdest decisions in how it wants to do things. The things that bothered me most were the inability to map my controller as it decided keeping things from the PS4 was not what it wanted and so changed some from there or that it even tells me what buttons to press on my dualshock.
0;Product received for free. After you see the 20ish actual monsters then its pretty damn boring. The usual MH has about 90. After you hit HR 100 theres nothing after that and you've already seen all the fights and they're kinda eh. It's got good match connection now which I guess is great but other than that its not all that fun. The only thing post HR100 to do is to finish a build or get more decorations but like I said its pretty damn boring after you've fought all the monsters a couple times.
0;pro fun gameplay and mechanics story was good. con felt really bored after end game keep farming for decorations and gems non stop connection issues still happen despite months after game release.too less monster extra bored fighting the same one over n over again
0;Horrible connectionDisconnected so many times and screwed up the fun and mission totallyBut since the patch released it's fixed 90%. So I will change my review.But lately I have experienced very bad connection and unable to find rooms even full of players. I am gonna stick with bad review.
0;do not purchase before the new patch comes out unless you plan to play soloas it is a lot of people are having connection issues very hard to connect to sessions and when you do there is a high chance you will disconnect in the middle of a quest. i suggest waiting until they tackle these issues
0;New player here almost played for 2 days a row... pretty enjoying because of the graphics sceneries etc. but one thing I hated the most is when I played to hunt/capture different bosses for hours then I started to save (3 times always + 1 save before Iogging out my account)... but the frustating part is when my account still going back to the start when I need to start hunting again those monsters that I already killed. Furthermore Fix the connectivity issues.
0;shts bunk but funseveral graphical issues idk why but when i have vsync off or unlimited fps i get this gross line across my screen hence why i have vsync on now at 60 fps (frame drops in elder recess though)connection errors every now and then most friends dc because of alt tabbingalso needs more sisterly fourths and fish aficianados like come on guys
0;"""Poor port cant rebind all keys doesnt support ultrawide resolutions Trying to play with friends makes you pull out your hair.""""Hunt alone or in co op with up to three other players"""" Maybe if the quest doesnt involve a cut scene or the game just doesnt want you to.Get it on sale if at all."""
0;Runs flawlessly on max settings.Console port so bring your controller along.Great music vibrant world. dlc on day one had to enable controller through big picture for it to work (and bp is horrible) so many d/c when trying to play coop ruins the coop play
0;The connection issues are pure cancer couldnt play a single session with my 3 other friends with at least one person disconnecting. All my friends and i bought this game to work together and this is what we get in return. Singleplayer gets boring after awhile so please Capcom fix this issue ASAP.
0;PLS fix miltiplayer network issue ! Always kept disconnect when playing with my friends and thats not my network problem i can literally play other games hours and hours without disconnect . MHW accept one quest then disconnect within 10 minits . GREAT GAME
0;As a game it is rather polished and definitely worth the money.However I bought this game for a multiplayer experience and disconnecting every 10 minutes is simply horrible regardless of the gameplay.If you are buying this for a single player experience its definitely worth your buck but if you are looking for a multiplayer one wait for a real fix to be deployed.
0;the game itself is awesome. But as a multiplayer kinda guy MHW's server errors are unacceptable. Don't even try guys u might get lucky for 1 2 games a day during non busy hours but its not worth the fustration. wait a month or just totally forget about this game.
0;Looks great runs great.It's Monster Hunter.EDIT While the above is still true. It's been 10 days and the multiplayer isn't fixed. And worse than that there's been next to no communication from Capcom about it.Great game be half the draw is being able to play with friend which is next to impossible in the game's currentl state.I'll recommend it when the game is fully playable again.
0;At the current state of this game I do no recommend this game. While the game is fun and the mechanic of the fighting is amazing the constant connection issue is really dissapointing. Getting dropped from a game when you almost kill a monster is really annoying and heartbreaking. CAPCOM needs to build new servers and they should have anticipated the wave of PC players. The fact that they didn't build new servers to handle the amount of traffic generated by PC players shows that they don't care.
0;Constant disconnects cannot do story missions with people who are in the same spot in the story. Pretends to be a multiplayer game is actually single player. DO NOT BUY. I strongly recommend never buying this game. I also strongly recommend Capcom employees to go to work and do their jobs.
0;Review updated to 31/08/18the game would be an 8.5 multiplayer works the game lasts for about 100 hours at least it's fun to hunt alone or with mates but the technical side of this game still presents plenty of problems graphical lacks compared to console version make this port worse than the original one.
0;the game is great however there is currently connection issues and the port is lacking and needs work for example theres no option to disable motion blur Depth of field or to adjust the voice chat volume and the mouse control is horrible so wait and see if the port gets improved will update to recommended if that happens.
0;I will update when they fix their bugs. If you want to play this with other people wait.Constant disconnects in the middle of doing anything.I also find not being able to do story quests together with friends until halfway through each quest extremely annoying and unnecessary.

0;GREAT GAME BUT..FIX ONLINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! or this game will die like others like it!!!update.... 8/23/2018new update was installed.. and OMFG made it much worse... before at least i could join SoS and have ppl join me.. now NOTHING WORKS.. THIS GAME!!!!! Capcom you.. get ur head out of your and fix the game... U OWE THIS TO US for having to wait this long for a game.. that might as well be alpha.... FIX THE GAME!!!!!
0;great game horrible DC (dc varies but its really awful dc non stop ) constantly RUINING experience NOT WORTH MONEY TILL They fix the issue or else you will be purchasing a game you can NOT play with FRIENDS and only waste your time disconnecting horribly. Note portforwarding doesnt work ! dont waste yopur time or effort only to discover it !
0;Game is running much better than my expectation with i5 3470 and GTX 1060. Good graphic and frame rate. Game content is soild. However i could not give it a possitive review until they fix the multiplay connection issue. I did not expect myself playing this game alone.
0;This game IS NOT fun for playing with friends. The multiplayer is a COMPLETE mess. All of these glowing reviews never mention this which leads me to believe they paid for all these great reviews.The gameplay itself is quite fun and the mechanics are good (though keyboard/mouse gameplay is super clunky) but this game is essentially a single player experience that you can grind with friends after for gear improvements.No thanks going to refund.
0;Great game but jesus christ the multiplayer is a disaster. capcom really screwed the pooch with this. Im on the same mission seen all the cutscenes (you cant play with friends if one has not seen all cutscenes in a quest which is ) and i still cannot play even after it said i am able to play multiplayer. also lock on system is absolute trash dont use it.
0;This game started out great fast updates fixing issues and weapon balance was great. In the last few weeks I find myself getting two tapped after unloading 7 or 8 shots into someones chest. I don't know if its Desync or what but servers need to be upgraded. Even for an early access game I can't recommend it in its current form perhaps a few months of updates will fix the issues.Edit 1 Also optimization seems to be going backwards in terms of performance for some.
0;Unable to remove depth of field or motion blur no 21 9 support. Same poor textures as on PS4 Volume Rendering is useless.The controller issues crashes the lack of PC UI the FAKE MOUSE support the black bars even on some 1080p monitors the way it stops many CPUs from even running the game the audio sync issues the missing DLC for many deluxe owners there are tons of legit issues.Over 6 month and Capcom release a hearthless console port. At the current state i can't recommend MHW to buy.
0;if you wish you wanna play this game with your friend just forgot this game atm. this game keep repeat kick me and my friend out of the match session like everytime or 9 time of 10 match. and it's just make this game really worth nightmare for newbie cos the boss getting stronger when u play with 2 or more people in your team and then everyone dissappear leave you alone with is mean unfair fight for newbie. Not recomment multiplayer looking till CAPCOM fix this.
0;Been playing for sometime the disconnection issues is really annoying and pretty unacceptable for a triple A title like this especially with no fix a week after launch gameplay wise its a really fun game and looking foward to all the issues getting fixed.
0;70 hours. Gone. I love this game I've loved all the MH games but for the LOVE OF GOD DO NOT beat the final boss. It has a chance to corrupt your save and just render it useless. And for that I cannot suggest this game with it being out for a week with no fix.
0;Game itself is well designed and developed but I can't recommend this game now.There are fatal network errors that most players can't play multi play.Players got only 1 update after 2 weeks pain and it never fixed the issue.I understand all the softwares always have bugs and I'm generous to bugs but CAPCOM IS LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY.
0;I still can't find people after the patch 280k people in the game and I fail to join Matchmaking sessions then finding a session has 2 people 1 in each of their own session..There is 0 social aspect of the game and the chat window is annoying as hell to operate. This game has a lot of work to do before I would recommend it.
0;No 21 9 supportAncient multiplayer systemServer issuesBut we still need to be happy and glad that our japanese overlords are allowing us to play this game on PC.Buy only if you are a foreveralone otaku that has no friends because the multiplayer does not work.
0;With recent patch it seems the online session has improve getting less error message or been disconnect... Well it's better than nothing.*Edit And......no still having error 83 mw1 I take back what i said and hope they fix it real soon. Soloing at the moment.
0;Bought for PC can't get past character creation without a fatal error that exits out of game. Tried to launch from steam and then from GeForce Experience as well. Same thing happens both times. NEVER bought a game that wouldn't run past the first few minutes...
0;The game is great but the networking is ing trash don't buy that ing You'll get a nice party to do some boss and then the game upscale the monster and all your buddies are gonna get disconned one by one and the monster isn't getting downscale after they all leave. You're now left with an unbeatable that you won't be able to kill even in your dreams.Good game. Don't buy it for the multiplayer it's trash.
0;It's a single player game at this point. Matchmaking does not work SOS Flare does work but if the folks trying to help you DC you end up with a monster that got boosted ( 2.2x health ) to MP levels and you are alone with it.Capcom needs to fix the multiplayer disconnects ASAP.
0;The game online session is so bad that it keeps disconnected. Also when doing quest the connection is changed to P2P. Not many people have good connection and if the leader is disconnected so do everybody on the group. Monster Hunter is a big franchise and it can't even provide players with a dedicated server. It's a huge dissapointment. I cannot recommend this game because of this issue.
0;Is the game good? Definitely.Assuming it actually works.Single player is doable but the true game lies in its multiplayer which is basically non existant due to connection issues.Wait for them to either fix the connection issues or wait for a big sale to play this single player game.
0;Great game but god awful port. It's been 10 days since release that's 80 work hours and Capcom hasn't done jack about the connection errors. They've acknowledged it 3 separate times now but in 80 work hours have done absolutely nothing. That is 100% unacceptable for a dev team that has hundreds of employees. Do NOT buy or support this game until it is fixed.
0;Network issues on a game that took 8 additional months to be released on this platform. That is unacceptable. If it has anything to do with the Denuvo DRM that has been known to be total #### then once again capcom has shown their craptasticly bad ability to produce a proper port. Don't buy until Network features are actually fixed.
0;Ok so this port is pretty bad crashes twice on me forced me to hard reset on both times. Fps droppage if it drops in cutscenes it desycn it to the point your cutscenes will be playing behind the audio. As if right now this game is in a unplayable mess.
0;love this game but the multiplayer is freaking bad broken everytime cannot play a decent game with my pals for more than 30 mins you guys have 6 months to improve this game and this is what you bring us feaking rip off fix it or it will be another no man's sky death game
0;After three days (25 hours playing time) I can already see this is going to be an awesome game EXCEPT the multiplayer is broken. I would love to recommend this game but because of the multiplayer and the hefty pricetag I'd much rather point them towards something like Warframe which is free... I really expected this game to be working like it should from day one.
0;At the moment no don't buy it until Capcom fixes the game. 8/29/18 The multiplayer works now tho Improve these Mouse acceleration Motion blur/bloom deactivation Allow extremely FULL modular keybinding. Make co op actually doable without watching a cutscene.
0;It took them more than half a year to make this port???I have a few gripes that could be fixed otherwise a solid game experience to the core but for the love of god fix the framerate and the ugly fur textures and give more graphics options along with 21 9 support this is 2018 thanks poogie.
0;Came back just to change the review. The amount of bugs still present is appauling. One of the major being FPS despite high end graphics cards even on the lowest of settings. During specific fights it'll freeze before the monster even attacks then cut to the fainted screen. Been tested on multiple computers.
0;Rarely do I leave reviews even rarer are they bad. The online portion is so broken its near impossible to use. To be honest even if it worked perfectly it seems like multiplayer gameplay was more of an after thought than planned out. If you are planning on getting this with a freind and leveling together look for a different game.
0;This game is great until you've experienced all the monsters and weapons to play with after that it turns into an even worse grind fest then it started as. There's not even a point to grinding at end game unless you feel like getting the perfect setup which is pointless cause you're already able to kill everything you're just grinding to make grinding easier. Pointless.
0;Please repair the network connection while playing sometimes the network connection is lost. but when playing other games network connections look good there are no problems on the internet why if you play monster hunter you have to break up from the internet. that's all I have a problem
0;this game is so fun and really good but the problem for this game only in the network connection !!steam need to fix this or people will go away from this game one by one..i have 10 friends buy this game then 8 from them refund this game because connection issue ' ')and still the connection still noob right now after lunastra update!!
0;It's fun and game until your connection become unstable and you have to face ing nergigante all alone. I don't know whether my connection or the game server is bad and that makes me desperate when doing multiplayer. The worst ing server i've ever played
0;Every Single Update ! Every Weekends ! 50382 / 5098 / 201 FULL OF DC ERROR CODE so many negative commend on each time issue happens and capcom hv no intension to solve or improve the issue at all repeating mistake cant be forgiven !Therefore i hereby giving a negative commend and not going to change this commend forever no more chances given u deserve a negative commend !
0;The servers can't even keep 4 people in the same session or game for more than 5 minutes anymore. It's been happening for an entire month with people dcing halfway through quests constantly. Enough is enough.Don't buy this game unless you intend to play solo.
0;I cannot recommend a game that is bloated with anti piracy enough to force someone to buy an SSD to play it. An update came that will not let me get past the logos and neither steam nor capcom will offer support.Capcom will not issue a refund and neither will steam.If you want this game pirate it capcom is not worth supporting.
0;Firstly the load to get on a map or make a server takes almost an hour second the game constantly is slow and freezes on me and third everytime i play for a while or even a few minutes the game freezes my entire computer making me haft to restart it. And I even tested this without addons or really anything in that matter this always happens to me.
0;Now I know what makes this game funnier MODS. Your wondering why I said not recommended for this game is not the gameplay it s not the building cosmetics and it s definitely not the graphics it s because this is the one version of the game you can beat in about a week if you don t have mods enable
0;The Game would be amazing without so many bugs. There has been a problem with saved games your money being stolen to a negative number and cant go back to positive unproportionate amount of oils just to name a few.To have bought this for 105 CAD im a bit disappointed.
0;It's been said before the AI sucks.This game is awesome in about every way and has added new features that do lend to great emersion. However the AI doesn't understand how to build and manager units on a the map during war or peace. I strongly suggest waiting to buy the game in hopes they release a patch to resolve the issue. Otherwise I think this game will have zero replay ability. I just thank god I've got some great alternatives to play to keep my mind off of this horrible experience.
0;I thought the AI was one of the worst parts of Civ 5 and I'm honestly shocked to see that it got even worse. AI makes the game boring and frustrating to play with no intellegence to speak of. Difficulty increase just buffs their production and other stuff making the game even more frustrating. Really dissapointing it just isnt fun to play. The game has been out for a week and I'm already desperate for them to make a big update.
0;Civilization is a great game but VI is not. I don't know why 2k can public such a game which contains so many bugs. stupid AI system unmatched Technology development speed embarrassed City state...... If u want to win the game please choose Aztec and attack every other player(or AI) at the first time...battle battle battle and u will find that u win zhe game in 300 BC!!! So fun the game is!!!! Excuse me??zhe game is Civ or Red Alert??
0;Short simple sypnosis. Gameplay mechanics new ideas are great and well implemented. The only problem is I don't use any of these due to fast tech unlock by eureka. Industrial Age by 1000 AC in King difficulty....Wait for expansion GOY on sale or when they fix this issue.Extra stuff Build order slingers &gt archers &gt warriors &gt nuke &gt nuke &gt easy win.
0;Cross platform multiplayer is not working. They advised it may not work for short periods of time between patches but the studio now says there will be no cross platform multiplayer for another 50 days. It's a real shame. Spent a lot on two copies especially to play with my fiance which now I can't do.
0;The gameplay is good but the build quality and testing is horrible. The ability to load a saved game does not work and the fix is egregious. This is the kind of thing they should have caught in testing based on the numbers of people experiencing the problem. Cannot recommend a game released in this state.
0;It's fun to build your empire.It's not fun to interact with the AI. The AI ist stupid in wars diplomacy and building it's empire.The AI should be one of the most important aspects of a civilization game.please Improve the AI Improve performance (turn times leader animation) improve mod support (most things are hardcoded) Make quality of live improvements (unit list)
0;Visually it's an appealing game. Full marks to Firaxis et al for that element. Game play on the other hand leaves a great deal to be desired. Between the irritating 'feature' of AI civs being clustered far too close to my founding city and the AI just plain cheating it's not worth the expense. If I could return it for a refund I would. Save your ducats and get Civ V instead.
0;This review is more about the feeling of the game rather than getting into the mechanics. It really isn't as charming as the previous Civs. The graphics and UI remind me more of a mobile game. Similar to what they did to The Sims 4. The district feature is a nice touch and I feel like Civ Leaders have more personality and weight to them. But at the end of the day as you'll read in many of these reviews it's just not quite living up to Civ 5's standards.
0;I find it obscene to put out a game that derives all its replayability from the different civs and then only putting 15 in.After a month you played them all and they dont even vary that much from each other. And on top they want money for the dlcs that realy should be for free. Just buy a paradox title.Eu4. Buy Eu4. Or if you want something more like civ. Maybe Endless legend? Just to see something new
0;The game even on the easiest setting just mows you over. It's not fun. There are stupid complexities introduced. Like builders can only be used three times. That's stupid. Game play is complicated and bugs and not worth $60. I've been successful talking three other people out of buying the game. They won't give me a refund so the best I can do is tell other people not to buy it.
0;Great game until my civilization became 'war weary' during peacetime. Then it kept getting worse. Peace for 100s of years! But my citizens were 'war weary' and thus unhappy and eventually revolting because they kept getting MORE weary of the war that did I mention? DIDN'T EXIST AND HADN'T EXISTED FOR 100s OF YEARS. Game broken. No until they fix this bug. Otherwise it's not much of an improvement on 5. So no even after they fix this bug at this price.
0;I used to be an avid Rocket League player but I've lost so much interest after the game moved towards keeping players hooked by prioritising gambling crates and premium passes. Meanwhile the game's servers player matchmaking bugs glitches and forgotten game modes continue to be neglected. Every time I launch the game (like twice a year at this point) there's always something new to unlock/buy and nothing to keep the core Rocket League experience fresh and entertaining.
0;Had recommended it before (back in 2016) but since then this game has gone downhill. Each update seems to break the game more. The servers are laggy and they keep putting paid content in it but won't fix the poor serversWill change it to recommend when they finally fix the servers
0;"""make this game freethis game is unplayable if you can't handle mentally deficient idiots who can't accept their mistakes and refuse to use their crippled brainpeople love to spam """"Okay."""" in chat to blame you because they are too self absorbed to realize they are ball chasing idiots who also have a responsibility to defend and not just dive their incopetent heads straight into the ballas long as people are idiots this game will be badyet i still play this stupid game"""
0;Sick and tired of playing on 150+ ping servers. When i bought the game dear developers consider yourselves we made an agreement (an ethical one). That agreement included some money and your service others did that too in my region. NOT JUST ONE COUNTRY If you haven't noticed that rent some servers with SOME of that money.
0;This game is completely ruined by Chinese hackers and bluehole's refusal to region lock China. There are multiple servers for a reason and yet bluehold cares more about their revenue from loot crates than anything else. Do not buy this game. It was fun before the Chinese invaded the NA servers with every cheat possible. Hopefully another developer creates a similar game and actually does something (anything) to prevent rampant hacking.
0;IN head game since they nerf the fact that you are playing with 12 years old kid saying at the beginning of the game I'M NOT PLAYING THIS ONE. i choose to forfeit and the option abandon is there. then i get banned for leaving a TEAMMATE in the ditch... right just in get it like it was in the first place ban people after the 3rd game of leaving abandonning for sake
0;Trash Ranking System Im plat and i always get paired with people who are trash at the game and I derank. Then its hard to get back up. If they fix their Ranking System the game would be better but right now its so broken. People who cant even arial Shouldnt be in Gold+
0;this game is wonderful if you can play with people. The matchmaking in normals is ing abhorrent. It has two modes get placed with people WAAAAY lower than you in skill against people WAAAAY higher than you in skill or the oposite. And every so often it gives you a decent game. Seriously this game's matchmaking psyonix fix your
0;"""Honestly if you are looking for a fun game with a good community. This is not the game to go for people think they are better than they actually are constantly insult without consulting to see if they are the issue. No gamesense until Diamond 2+ and within 750 hours I can succesfully say im uninstalling Devs are out of good ideas gameplay is seemingly lacking Devs are stealing ideas from other games Ie """"Rocket Pass"""" stolen idea from Fortnite's """"Battle Pass"""". Psyonix the EA of steam."""
0;"""I've put a ton of time into this game. Imagine League of Legends if there were even less consequences for your behavior. This game has one of the most toxic communities I've ever seen. I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone unless your plan is only ever use it for private party games with friends. Stay as far from this game and its """"community"""" as you possibly can."""
0;4th match in a row I join that is 0 6 this game has a ridiculous matchmaking system garbage community that can only flame you or leave the game don't buy rocket league just don't there are better free to play games you can waste your time on. DON'T BUY THIS GAME
0;"""I hate this game new update isn't ok i get banned 24 hours for ? Idk and now i get 72 for some """" ing god shoot """" or something like that that isn't ok u can block toxic players but no """"BAN 72HOURS/ Next 7 DAYS / AND permanent and scammers plays this game for long time but no for trashtalk u can get permanent ban"""
0;I love this game I love this game I love this game.BUT Don't put me into games where the team I am joining is down by 3 4 5 6 7 etc goals already. Much less five consecutive times. Nobodwy (that I know) wants to join a game like that. One goal down ok two perhaps but more than that? No way.I will change my rating as soon as this is fixed.
0;Rocket League is a solid game but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Toxic community aside Psyonix seem dead set on getting as much money as possible through constantly releasing new crates in quick succession to fund their esports community while not giving a single toss about the average player.
0;Great game up until a recent patch that automatically bans you for any swearing in the chat no matter what the context. Thanks for letting us know you were implementing this into the game and banning thousands of players. If swearing in the chat of a video game ruins your experience you simply shouldn't be playing games.
0;Garbage ing servers. Garbage ing demos. Garbage ing updates. Psyonix has been out for your money since crates and not really putting any effort into fixing the godamn goal posts or the laggy ing servers. Holy ing this game can be so trash. Oh and when different servers ( West Oceania etc..) join your game in ranked and they can hit every shot but they're lagging across the field and when you get close your PC wants to explode. All in all a good game
0;Positive Only fun to play when u play with Skilled FriendsNegative Toxic Community Players only ask for trading in Matches up to Platinum Enemys everytime like Diamond+ and own Team Bronze Matchmaking System is like CSGO as hell Psyonix doesnt care about the Players only looking for Money from Crates and Keys (again like cs) Report System doesnt work reports are like Steam Reports nosense.
0;Recently the game has seen quite a dip in quality. The community has gotten pretty toxic and the servers are pretty terrible. The ranking system has shown evidence of many boosted players that can't hang on their rank and then drag other people down. I don't really know about other games but the community for this one has declined a lot and that means a lot to me in a game.
0;Yeah nobody asked for microtransactions. I don't need another gamble simulator in my videogames. The way it was handled before was fine. Took one update and one stupid decision to make me drop one of the bests games out there currently.Shame on you guys.If you're into stupid online gamblin and silly hats that nobody ever will pay attention too this is your way to go now next to CSGO and TF2.
0;The ranking system in this game is just miserable. It can take up to 3 wins to rank up a divison and you can lose that division in 1 loss. Almost impossible to win sometimes because the game pairs you with lower levels or people who are worse than you and you win 2 games in a row but then the next 2 games after that you're the one thats worse than the other team. Its just a constant battle between ranks teammates and trying not to break your controller/keyboard.
0;Fix your god damn F***ing competitive rejoining my internet disconnected for 20seconds i tried rejoining again and it returned me to main menu 10 seconds later then internet fixed and there was no rejoin option again 15minute ban when partied with 2 of my friends. trash setup fix your crap psyonix!
0;banned for 24 hrs for responding to someone that instigated my friend and I intentionally. worth noting i didnt swear or engage in any hate speech whatsoeverdont buy unless youre prepared to censor yourself despite the toxic community that by a large margin pervades every facet of communicationgame is good. developers are babies. majority of playerbase is composed of incorrigible abominations of hate and sweaty palms.if youre a mute and cant type i very much recommend this game
0;I love this game and its so fun... but after this update it crashes all the time its so annoying and bad. Im so confused how you still have not fixed this bug yet its a new season i want a good rank and im just crashing every game i loose to ppl who should be silver because the crashing it has never been like this. I hope you look up my review and fix the game.
0;This game was the absolute I loved this game and played it competitively. But this new update has ruined the game. Before the update I was playing with a ping of 8. Now after the update I play with a wopping 268 ping. You can not play this game with a 268 ping and enjoy it.
0;Psyonix get your togheter.Don't get me wrong I like this game but since the new update theres a of lagg (never had lagg not even in very heavy games).FIX THE LAGGYou can't even play ranked 'cuz your car dissappears in the ground everything flashes around and you even miss the damn straight kickoff due this lagg.Really get you togheter and fix this.
0;To Be Honest This game is ed up Collision is done Wrong.You can clearly see the developer have no idea of Force.Dont buy it. Dont play it. Ask your money back.Until the game is rewriten it is not playable.The server allow people with over 200 ping.Higher Ping means extra time to react.
0;used to be a great game maybe thats just for console but now you can lag at 40 ping I have 1 gig internet speeds but rocket leagues tells me my internet sucks well i am saying if you wanna buy a game that does not do the neccesary upkeep on their servers then look no further rocket loeague is for you. I can play any other game no problem. for example destiny 2 fortnite crossout wow league of legends cod tekken. so why is it that this game lags out?
0;Win 3 in a row go up a division. Lose 1 go down a division. Win 2 in a row and don't go up a division. Lose another and go down another division. The ranking system on this game is absolutely terrible and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone till it gets fixed.
0;Do you like reliable servers? Do you want a lag free experience? If you answered yes to either of these questions then you've come to the wrong place! Don't get me wrong this game is fun but when you lag with good ping and it cost you a game multiple times it makes you want to punch your screen
0;rocket league is just another game where people rage out at you and blame you for thier mistakes an online game its fun with friends solo its like punching a turd slightly satisfying but now you have turd smeared on your knuckles if you have friends interested in the game play it if you dont dont spend the money the community is very toxic
0;They are banning for abusive chat for no reason i mean you cant just ban someone for 7 days just for flaming someone i mean no other game does this THIS GAMEI can't believe it.... if you arent going to play it only 1v1 or older than 9 dont buy it. If i could choose now i would get my money back.
0;Don't play this game unless you're playing with friends. Garbage ELO system and matchmaker. You'll be with/against the same 4 or 5 out of 6 people you played with in your previous match. Losing is weighted higher than winning so ranked is just a giant grind.
0;Im actually kinda sad that im giving the game up for the simple but massive reason that the cumminuty is actually the most toxic hateful community i have ever come across. The only other community i have to compare it to is the dota community... even that is pg rated compared to this community.Not only that but psyonix has done an absolutely horrendous job of keeping the servers maintained and free of server side lag. This is one of the most frequently laggy games ive ever played
0;Game is alot of fun but will off even the most chilled gamers when youre getting teammates or put up agains gods. The Scoring system is awful scored 5 goals in my last game and still got divisioned down... they need to fix it before i just drop this game because atm the scoring systim is cancer af.
0;"""This game was fun for a while. But then it got old when the ball would warp through me or the ball would """"wiggle"""" around me visibly and go right passed me. Servers have never been fixed they just keep raking it peoples money and putting out tournaments where people play on LAN and there aren't these issues."""
0;servers are trash ill randomly get 200 ping in my own region and an everlasting meter and box symbol flashing across my screen. everyone starts teleporting and you cant even control your own car.gotta love those people who rage in the first 10 seconds.
0;iest game ever im finally at veteran level skill and level and i just get paired with rookie and afk people and the other them always has premade expert legendary sometimes i even get to play against roketeer or something yellow wirtten season 3 grand champion wtf is this? or i just get a room with 400 ping fix ur
0;I'd like to give this game a 5 star review but I just can't until they fix the rubber banding issue. I'll be going to save a shot on goal and all of a sudden my car will be to the right of the ball and I'll miss and the other team will score. It really adds up and pisses me off. It makes this game unenjoyable and it literally happens multiple times a game. So until this issue is fixed I'm giving it a thumbs down.
0;Since the last update the game randomly crashes while playing ranked matches then when I boot it up to rejoin it says no reservation found followed by a 5 minute matchmaking ban because 'I left' a ranked match. Otherwise great game to muck around on when you don't have much time since they're only 5 minute matches and its pretty fun. Community is pretty hit and miss though lots of toxic people who will blame you for everything (even if you have the most points on your team).
0;Rocket Pass is a Joke. i buy 10 keys and if i want the whole bunch of rewards i have to cash again ... thanks for making it very achivable for everyone and not only the people that are just starting and cashing keys. seemse like they are running out of money. i want to refund the rocket pass and rocket league.
0;"""You should urgently fix banning for 15 min altough connection is lost without no reason while I am playing. Then you ask whether I would like to rejoin by saying that """"Your connection seems to be lost by accidentally"""". I say yes. And baaam. I cannot join the game again and am banned for 15 min. It is the dummest thing I have ever seen!"""
0;To be honest this game is pretty trash i have a high end computer and the preformance is bad. The servers are trash each time im in game my friend and i all ways getting high latency or latency Variation which allways triggers me.Pls do not buy this game its a en waste of money if you want to be pro at this game your wasting your life trying
0;Possibly one of the most rage enducing games i've ever played. The toxic players the fps lag the glitches and of course the people that quit after 1 goal is scored. The one positive of this game is how its always being updated. still wouldnt recommend it though.
0;"""Psyonix dont care about cheating allow Pathbots / AFK Bots and more.Dont write Topics they contain """"cheat"""" in title or u will be banned by a childmod.If u love profilimages they contain porn/childporn or anything else right place to be because psyonix give a sh about own ingame content.dont buy this game if u dont like above or better dont buy use steamfamily from friends."""
0;Do not download this for Mac until it comes out of beta. Updates are released without testing/caring how it impacts Mac. Frame rate is terrible and Steam Controller doesn't work.edit Yes. It is still in beta or at least that is the excuse given by steam. I wish it were just my mac but it's a common bug that many are still impacted by. Still not fixed.
0;Seems fun at first but then you discover things like physics being weird hitboxes being totally different size/shape than the actual cars... Also the ranking system is garbage. I have played like 1000 matches in solo standard with 56% win rate and stayed around low gold all time. Sometimes the game even demotes you after winning a game. Also trolls and griefers run rampant and never get banned. Don't buy this game if you are a competitive player.
0;Game itself is fun but the servers are very touchy for a good connection you can play with a 42 ping and have a worse connection than someone at 300+ ping and connection interrupted. Until Psyonix fixes the server problem and not just keep releasing new crates instead the game is hardly playable at higher levels
0;One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen. Crossplay is a terrible implementation for a competitive game. If you get a cooldown for leaving a ranked game you can't play unranked either. For someone with a lot of patience and a good temper recommended. For someone with a short temper who just wants to have fun and not experience bullying and nerve wracking bugs definitely not recommended.
0;I loved it.I played a lot.Then I realize that no matter how good you are or how long you play you still can loose against rookies. The game actually have a lot of bugs inside like ball bouncing on walls or cars which give very crazy angles. I thought it was a game of skills but it's just about luck 75% of time.Devs prefer to add more and more buyable contents. They stopped game fixes long time ago now.So I uninstalled
0;well ive just lost my 14 keys lab and all my painted breakouts for no reason i just logged in and saw my car had nothing on apart from my wheels and i check in my inventory and most of my items have just dissappered tbh this has caused me not to spend anymore money on this game unless this can be resolved thanks a lot rocket league.
0;Very good game and very balanced skill wise. Trash servers and very little community care. Psyonix likes money nor do they care about improving the overall quality of the game. If you are new buy it. Anybody who has played at least 300hrs knows that this game is just a cash cow.
0;"""&gt Connect to online game&gt Rocket League crashes for the 100th time this week&gt Restart Rocket League&gt """"Not connected to Rocket League servers""""&gt Hit yes 50 times&gt Banned for 10 minutes for abandoning game10/10 would get match making banned again"""
0;Nice game some bad servers Rocket League team lies to customers on forums and no changes happen even after acknowledging their mistakes. Because of that its a 1.5/5I would have given it 4/5 if it was not for the devs and staff actions along with some server performances.
0;I played the other game modes but Casual Snow Day was the only mode I really liked. It was removed and replaced with a ranked version and is now significantly less fun. Since it seems Casual Snow Day will not be coming back and I haven't played since I think it's time to uninstall this game and never come back.
0;This lootbox system must be a hoax. You pay a lot of money for this keys to get useless skins all the time. I mean you are not even able to deal with them. So why is it so hard to get nice items? This is a fckin joke. You make me never wanna pay again for lootboxes for real. I will never ever in my life buy a key again. This is just a waste of money.
0;Psyonix added lootboxes after the game got out of EA and still has not sorted its servers out. That aside the game is pleasant. The maps are dumbed down when compared to SARBPC which means that pretty much everything that comes out is a reskin of the base stadium. I completely forgot about rating this game earlier which is why this review does not add anything new to the table. Still I feel like I had to do it.
0;Impossible to start playing this pathetic pile of crap they call ranking will always put you up against people with 400 hours that you have no chance of defeating ..... RIP my 12 bucks at least i bought it from . EDIT AFTER 100H As of 15.11.2017 the ranking is still ed. *Start placement matches*9 out of 10 wins*Get placed in bronze 3 for some reason*Win 14 matches in a row*Finally hit silver*Lose 2 in a row*Instant deranking to bronze 2 div.2 Minecraft has better ranking system than this.
0;Getting banned from casual for leaving ranked is the most idiotic mechanic especially when you have to deal with immature children who throw the match for no reason. Stupid penalty for us when those idiots get no punishment whatsoever. move by Psyonix.
0;Report simulator 2k18 every pleb just reports people instead of playing and psyonix grants their wish of timing people out instead of creating a helpful tutorial or a level requirement before they play ranked. Worst match making since dota otherwise this is a fun game. Also whoever has the higher ping gets the upperhand to ghost through the game and break the physics.
0;"""Since this update online games have become unplayable. My ping is showm as 16 and I have so much lag that I got stuck in a game because whenever I hit the ball into the goal nothing happened (the ball got dark but there was no explosion and the goal was not credited). Great game horrible ping detection and lag. Also I play with every video setting on """"maximum performance"""" and with audio off. My CPU usage when I start playing is always 15% and it jumps to 80% when I am playing the game."""
0;Are we only focusing on cosmetics now? The quality of the game seems to decrease every update that comes out... We only care about skins not wins! After 1.2k hours I think I have to say this game is really not worth the time or money. It was fun at first but eventually the terrible MM and servers start to get to you. This game was fun in 2016/2017 now it's a joke.
0;to simply put it this game sucks eggs.the driving is so stupid you spend hundreds of hours and still suck why cant it be more like mario kart.i already spend $15usd to buy the dang game why are there skins? why have i bought the skins?stupid game buy overwatch and play lucio ball instead.3/10 only because im being generous
0;ing horrendous match making. 30k (PC) plus players and got put with the same players 5 times in a row. Also getting put in games that already ended or getting put in a game that already started and your team is losing is ing stupid. Match making ruins this game. 0/10 dont bother with this over hyped trash.
0;This game is great you will be having a great amount of fun playing it and its fun until u meet a player who ruins your game and u rage quit lol.but as of recently the huge amount of server issue Troll players slow matchmaking the game saying 0 Players in the game while matchmaking or saying i am not logged into steam what the hell!!!this is frustratingnow today i cannot even enter a game because of matchmaking issue ( Unable to contact matchmaking server trying again ... (error 68) )
0;Very hard to play this anymore i used to play while streaming this but now is just impossible to do that without streaming having 80 100 ping. Can't hit the ball is just teleporting and doing weird staff like doesn't even bounce of walls or cars it just teleports.
0;Recent updates have made this game nothing short of unstable. They're adding too much flare to what used to be a great game. All of these new fancy features add instability and poor performance.Have a 980 and i7 like me? Doesn't matter. Does your computer have absolutely 0 issues when you play any other game? None of the above matter. You will freeze get poor performance and crash often.Do not purchase until they fix these issues.
0;New update added a lovely new ban system that'll ban you if you say naughty words.In the meanwhile all of the jackarses who are ruining your game on purpose by playing against their own team because the poor matchmaking put them in a match way above their level then get to report you and beg other people to report you and you'll get banned either way.Maybe actually fix the cause of the toxic bs going on instead of treating the symptoms. Then this'll become a positive review.
0;If you feel like getting paired with mediocre players and constant losing because people refuse to work as a team download this game. If playing alongside trolls and ignorant children appeases you download this game. If horrible gamemakers and TOS is your dream to be involved with download this game. If team play and fun are what you looking for run away do not purchase this game.
0;rocket league is best game in world we want 1000 dollar back because I lost all to dumb Indian man. The dumb Indian man me and my uncle and made me very very sad. If I don t get my money back my mom will shut down every rocket league server ever. thanks BekezoMeade
0;It's a nice game but they ruin the game with every update.Everytime they add a new map they need to add a map a map that's very impossible to play and have fun..They added an option to like and dislike the maps.You dislike the maps that you don't want but surprise...you only plaay that map that you disliked and those new maps aree horrible..
0;Its just sad that the recent update make my game unplayable from its major increase in ping to over 300ms even on my region (SEA). Overall the game is very addicting but please fix the servers especially SEA or this game will eventually lose players in a short matter of time.
0;Reasons i dont reccommend Atrosious network optimisationPay2win Yes thats right most of the micro transaction cars have a better hitboxyou dont play with people your level in competitve (me and my friend both challenger 1 play with challenger 2s and 3s because idk whyWay too many micro transactionswhy do i still play this game? i dont know myself but it's like heroin i hate it but i also love it
0;All in all it's an awesome game BUT THE COMMUNITY IS TOXIC AND SALTY! Every match you got leaver or unfair player or infantils insulting the other players or even worse! Even if you report this players nothing happens. Psyonix Inc. is just interested in selling DLCs and the keys for the crates.
0;Fun gameplay. Everything else i pretty terrible. The servers suck big time constant rubber banding. Cannot use in game chat without squeakers telling you to uninstall the game. The best part is if your internet or power goes out or the game the bed you get banned from all matchmaking. Can't open in game loot crates without paying money. Micro transactions are a scourge on the gaming community. Not worth the money.
0;This game is terrible. Do you want to play without friends? good luck the community is complete If you so much as call a teammate out for being an (scoring on your own goal) the autoban system bans YOU for 24+ hours. Want to leave that game? The ban system will ban you. Basically disable chat and pray your teammates are good otherwise play with your friends or not at all because Psyonix is a piece of At least steam wont ban me for speaking my mind.
0;Alright game but very clear shown how money greedy the company is through releasing more and more crates even often now than before. Decent game but can be repetitive and boring alot of the time especially for lower leveled players that are stuck at the bottom left with the option of either carrying the team or always queuing with other you rely on.
0;"""What ever degenerate decided to allow this games competetive to have the map """"Neo tokyo"""" needs to be burned on a stake and eaten by feral rats. The amount of times if lost on this autistic retard map to peasants is uncountable. The lips on the side make me want to suffocate in my own anu s."""
0;The takes in the game are really unbalanced as you can purchase cars wwho are heavier with real money. Also i'm a veteran and keep getting matched vs legends/masters/experts. Although i lose the majority of these games i keep getting matched against them. There is literally 5k people in the queue at a time so dont tell me there's no veteran onlineA game which features a competitive game mode but then has no control of the ranking system is not a game that i can recommend
0;The game itself is awesome...but the online play is sooooooooooooooo glitchy. Either they have totally missed a bug that lets other people mess with your connection or their servers are just really really bad. Either way the gameplay is very different online and infinitely frustrating.
0;The gameplay is solid the matchmaking is what I would expect if Donald Trump screwed Helen Keller. The community for this game is the biggest piece of group on earth. They make the league of legends community look like human rights proponents. My recommendation if you get this game is to never play it online. There should be a way to turn the chat off so you don't have to see it on the screen.
0;Sorry but this game has bad team selecting and i play 39 games of comp 2v2 and evry game in a 29 game streak it was 2v1 thair shud be a 24 hr bad if you leave befour the game is over it makes the game no fun so untill this is fixed i donet recommend this game i am sorry
0;I recommend it but stilll if it was /5 its a 3/5 your ranking system is pure crap your matching system is pure crap how tf do you put an expert vs a rocketeer in ranked? physics for hitting the ball with your car should be improved so i hit the ball going 50m/s and it goes 5m/s? ever heard of newtons laws? rather than adding items how about you fix your base before.
0;Some of the most fun gameplay I've seen recently but the community is absolutely atrocious. Don't even think about joining a game and not muting everyone else in the game instantly unless you want to deal with people constantly on if not you then each other.
0;This games community is okay at times but then there is no ban system in place for people who use horrible slang. Was just called the N word over and over and told to go pick cotton by a player. I know all online games have children that play but if you do not punish these children your community is going to go toxic. Fix your ban system or watch your game go in to the trash can...
0;Stupid game with stupids lags. Sometime it's impossible to play because of those lags and if you quit for it ... you're MF***** banned from the game for 15 stupids minutes. I used to loved this game but now it suck. And if you have a problem with the game don't ever think about reach any support
0;"""Has the worst dumbest and most immature community ever.""""review the game not the community"""" eat a banana lol. The community is part of the game reporting toxic players barely makes a difference and if the game and the devs can't handle their community then it's a bad game.What a save!What a save!What a save!What a save!Player IWasBornAPro left*Enjoy the rest of the game with the worst AI known to men* lol"""
0;This Game might be good or even great but i can not play it. Because the fu***** developers dont tell any kind of ports that this game uses so i can forward these ones. Thousands play this game and still the developers do not give any information on the ports this is ridiculous. How can a game be this popular with such a bad service. And it is overpriced considering the content of this game 10 would be fair.
0;This game used to be a lot of fun until the last update in December caused me and a lot of other folks issues with using a controller. It's been about a month with no update/fix. Lots of folks talking about this in the forums. I hope Psyonix is listening. I'll update this review if its fixed in a reasonable amount of time.
0;The game itself is good. Review would be positive butthe DLC policy is cancer.EDIT Even years after its release technical problems that have been here for eternities still remain persistent and unfixed. Instead we get rocket passes and dozens of new items each patch.Thanks I guess
0;I only recommend it if you're planning to play this game with friends. Playing solo only makes me wanna quit playing.Ranked is complete trash unless you play with some friends or you get lucky with some good teammates...Community is toxic piece of crap. Get called out for everything and with the broken ranked system that matches noobs with better players only to derank yourself.Stay away from this game unless you have friends or don't play ranked at all.
0;The new content in the recent update is aweosme but the skill reset has made it really boring. Most games are a gross mismatch of level and skill which means either team wins by a huge margin. I used to love playing this every day but now most games are super frustrating or really easy.
0;Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie You can't hit . You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still .
0;I got banned becouse of swearing?? He started the fight first becouse I said I got it before him and hit the ball he got mad and started scoring own goal??? And I've got banned couse of some kid being a little crybaby and sweared back.Thanks RL now I cant enjoy a game couse of your matchmaking system by getting mates like that.
0;So after 700 hours and just about being done with the game because they have nothing new coming out that makes the game fun again they make a ban system that bans you for saying anything slightly negative and I get banned for 24 hours for saying 1 bad word. Good luck rocket league.
0;I love this game I REALLY do but the newest updates are mutually disliked by anyone I talk to within the community and myself understandably. Please don't buy this game at the moment. Let Psyonix know that not every change they make has to be accepted by anyone. Please don't buy that rocket pass stuff either. At least not while the XP/Level system is this much of an annoyance.
0;game rewards dog players i uninstalled because i lost 10 games straight and my teammates were all room 7 your game ing sucks you just lost a supporter you dumb s pull your head out of your and create game that allows people to get better and win other than get worse and win just ing unintelligent as you dumbass dinks fix the ing game
0;You get banned for leaving a casual game of rocket league which defeats the purpose of casual game play. Casual game play mean that you should be able to leave the game whenever you want and not get banned. Especially when you are playing with other players that are new to the game and are at a much lower skill level than you.
0;The game is alright to play with some friends but like most games not fun alone. The servers have continued to be bad with lots of crashing as well as lag during most games. The only thing to do offline is play vs easy bots since all difficulty level is the same. If you are going to buy the game I would wait for a under 5$ sale because it is a good time killer with a group of friends. Thought I would add in that matchmaking for the game still seems off lots of mismatches in most games.
0;It's good in the beginning but once you get your skills you only get teamed with the biggest noobs on the planet (and thats saying it nicely). Unless you're on a team with your friends you will lose and lose at this game due to you're ***************************************ing team mates.
0;Plain and simple the new micro update (banning system) did it for me. 600+ hours and I think now is the time to wave the white flag on this game. Maybe Psyonix have got a little too big for their boots? At the end of the day they've lost my custom by implimenting this little totalitarian update. Hey ho.P.S. I've had this account since 2004 and out of all my games I decided to comment on this bloody one. Strange days!!
0;The game is actually quite good but the Dev team likes to torment it's player base by adding in bad maps that the community doesn't like at all and they refuse to remove them from the rotation. Overall these awful maps have ruined my play experience enough to make we no longer want to play the game and so it is uninstalled. Well played Psionix ignoring the player base is always the way to go!
0;Game lags out. Alt F4 doesn't work. Open task manager to kill. Restart game. Try to reconnect. Says can't connect to server. Try to join matchmaking again. I'm banned for 15 minutes. As much money as people are throwing at these guys you would think they could invest a little in their servers.
0;Don't buy this game the idea is nice but broken mechanics random goals toxic community and most importantly the specs you are playing (including your internet speed which always has to be stable even if ping rises by 5 10 you get rubber banding). You will ultimately feel bad about losing games which you really deserved to win which is unbalanced and unfair.
0;just saying if u toxic like me dont buy this game if some one will win u gonna want to kill ur self or broke ur computer and u gonna freak out with ur self! but is 1 thing that i love in this game is the trades is makes me feel good and then u wanna play with the skin u tradedand u 1v1 some one guess what happend (game deleted) if u want buy this but just saying dont buy this!! thanks.
0;Game had always run fine suddenly i start having connection issues ( Rubber banding) every single game i play. my ping is 90 on ME/Europe servers and always have been. Im pretty sure its not my connection thats faulty as i play other online games just fine. Right now the game is BROKEN for me and has been for at least a couple of weeks. This needs to be fixed.
0;Current experience with this game is as follows Matchmaking for players with similar skill level against PRO ranked players against a team of rookies and one semi pro and did I mention that most goals scored against a pve match was my allies drivbing the ball in the goal we were defending?... Quite bothersome.
0;This game is literally the iest game i own. I dont enjoy playing at all. All you do is get ads and cancer. All the little 12 year olds in the game make you tilt out of your mind and the toxic people are terible. I would not racommend this game as it is a experiance and a terrible game thanks
0;The game could be fun. The problem is the match making system is such trash you can expect to either completely destroy the other team or get completely destroyed. The best is when it fills the other team with high level players first then gives you two trash bots or beginners. If that sounds like fun best game ever. For everyone else find something better to do.. like kicking a wall.

0;"""I wouldn't buy this game because it has a bug called """"heavy car"""" which makes your car slow in general turning doesn't work as sharply and inputs don't register properly etc. Psyonix is unwilling to co operate with community to fix this major problem. For those who get the bug the game is unplayable at a higher level."""
0;Was great about 6 months ago. Sure there was occasional lag but the game was still playable.In the last few months the game has been playable in phases. During the last month the trajectory of the ball is temperamental between bounces. Cars a teleporting periodically which makes blocking near impossibleThe game just seems like rubbish to play lately and as a result has been uninstalled from my machine.
0;The gameplay is fine I have no problem with that. But the ban system is a damn joke if you say bad words not even racial slurs you get banned pretty much instantly and after 3 bans your 4th ban will be a permanent. Also the matchmaking and ranked system is idiotic too so I don't recommend buying this game it used to be so much better and enjoyable.
0;It was fun until I hit level 20. Now I'm stuck in a purgatory where everyone is better than I am and I can only win 1 out of every 5 games. I know I'm not that good at this game so why can't I play with other players of similar skill? The game is completely ruined for me.
0;Got reported by 1 or 2 of the players on the enemy team for having fun and messing with my friend in chat by calling him names. This resulted in a 24 hour ban which starts the next time you log in which was a week later. Fix your report system 1 or 2 reports should not result in a 24 hour ban. Also I guess I'm not allowed to make jokes in chat anymore.
0;Don't buy this game! You'll regret it... Seriously!!! Matchmaking is so poorly written you'll end up with teammates so freakin' far away from your own skill level you wish you could actively harm someone. And the devs don't seem to care at all. JUST DON'T BUY IT!
0;I enjoy playing this game but don't suggest buying it because my rocket league glitches and dosn't start up. I know some other people that this has happened to. It deletes the msvcr100.dll file and then it won't start up. I keep putting the file back in but now it just totally stops working. If you see running then it says syncing and stops the program then you need to replace the file. Overall I think this is a 4 star game.
0;Great game but needs a mature language filter too many baby back es that report for cursing. like what the is wrong with them either take typing out of the game or just add the ing filter EVERY other game known to ing man has one. 2nd time ive been banned because of ing snowflakes yet they spam the chat and dont get banned.
0;Great game ruined by a toxic minority. I did get my money's worth and the game itself is fantastic. But at some point the abuse went too far and I haven't played since. That was months and months ago and I'm not tempted back.Psyonix fix what needs fixing for the sake of the game!
0;This game lost its appeal when the focus was set on being the new thing at the scene of e sports and loot crates (gambling) was introduced to get certain cars. I was fine with paying for getting new cars but having to gamble for skins and cars is just too much.
0;"""Factually Rocket League is car soccer.IMHO Rocket League is a game where you dribble or shoot the ball to the opponents' goal and your ing teammates block your shot or tackle you.10/10 IGN """"Best way for your friends or stranger teammates to trigger the flying out of you"""""""
0;"""Nice game horrible automatic ban system 24h ban just because I wrote """"STFU moron"""" to another player who was insulting me and my family only because I was (way) more skilled than him.I won't play this game anymore and definitely don't recommend it."""
0;There are 3 phases of rocket league 1 you enjoy starting off and learning the game (first 50 hours)2 The matching system is horrendous and you play unranked platinum players when you are in silver great (till you reach platinum)3 you have reached platinum and the game is deeply averagehonest review (
0;Hands down worst match making in any game ever. Its also Pretty bad for a competitive game to not allow you to communicate with your teammates if they are on console. forcing a loss with every crappy psy player there is.The net code is some of the worst ive ever seen any blip in you connection at all will cause you to get hugh lag spikes. Called out there devs for boosting people and got banned from the fourms. what a piece of company.
0;The game is awesome.The pairing system is absolutely garbage.If you don't have a steam partner forget it u're screwed because u'll get paired up with people 1 o 2 divisions below and the enemy team will be way better than yours.Once u loose u'll be downgraded and to regain that loss u'll have to win 3 games.The game is good the servers and pairing system will make u want to play anything else.
0;There is plenty of good reviews about this game.I enjoy it mostly the ICE rink mod. wish that was the main game as i find the ball touch too random for my taste.what i really hate about the game is matchmaking and joining games with 1 minute to go loosing 6 nul.just fix that all ready.
0;FIX THESE F*****G SERVERS ALREADY PSYONIX!I enjoy playing this game but its lattency problem with the servers are making this game unplayable i never had an issue with this before why are you guys not fixing it already? This is a very annoying and has been going on since the summer of last year instaid of updating DLC'S and add ons to Rocket league yall should focus on making the game playable for their customers/players.
0;Its matchmaking system is the worst that I have ever experienced in a video game. If you don't have a party to play with prepare to join matches that have already started and your team is losing by an insurmountable score. This will never be properly solved until they punish leavers for intentionally leaving games with 10 minute bans so it is not worth leaving games and jumping from one to another.
0;So after the most recent update I decided to bother writing a review for this game. I have had a love hate relationship with Rocket League for over 1000 hours. This update has killed it for me however. At 74 ms I'm lagging across the map rubberbanding and missing the easiest touches I've done coountless times. I do not suggest for anyone to buy this game in it's current state. Once the patches get fixed I'll come back and update as needed
0;After many updates the game still has terrible server issues with sometimes constant packet loss sometimes it just decides to kick you out of the game for no reason. It can have its moments of fun but unless you have a full group of friends to play with it simply is not worth your time.
0;Endless matches where you have to carry players who have thousands of hours at this game. The community is filled with people below 15 years old (or atleast they act like it) that makes no sense in their argumentation or unjustified flaming. Don't buy this game if you don't want to encounter such players which I guarantee that you will.
0;Very often I have the problem that I can't connect to the rocketleague servers. At least that is what the game says. It seems to be a common problem but there seems to be virtally NO support from the devs for this. Maybe they are buisy to sell keys for nonsense stuff so they can not be bothered to make the game playable...
0;Was enjoying the game till i get on to play online and see that i'm banned for 24 hours because of cussing in a video game. Got through that ban and a few games later my teammate quits on me with 1 minute left and down 1 goal because he was toxic af and i cuss again and the other team reports me. Why can't the dev add a toggle for swear words like all the other games? Instead of having automatic insta ban for any report that contains swear words.
0;Avarage age of community is too low (around 15) and those childs are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo salty even on casual mode. Imo the end of this game is going to be this stupidity. My point is do not even think about buying the game if you don't have friends already playing the game. You can have fun with friends. (I don't even bother playing alone anymore because of that. Thank god i have people to play with lol ).
0;Physics need to be upgraded. Stuff that happens in this game over rides any kind of skill. Lucky bounces and lagging goals atleast twice every 3 games. Insane that this game has gotten so popular yet Psyonix doesnt care to fix the physics. Too worried about new crates and items when they should first fix the whole point of the game.
0;If you like to have fun this is not the game for you. A bunch of sweaty nerds that report over the dumbest things because they are losing and the psyonix actually bans people for it. Pathetic game I'll probly get banned just for making this post thats how out of control they are. Might as well give out participation trophies for everyones feelings that get hurt on online gaming.
0;the biggest thing that needs to change in rocket league is the rank matches. why should someone be punished meanwhile his team mates leave him during the match and the other team as an unfair advantage it's not fair and therefore your rank system is flawed. I do not recommend if you want a good rank system
0;Fix your ranked maches or at least pay more attention to who is placed where because other than your servers not able to handle the amount of people playing some of the time the smurfs are a huge problem for anyone actualy wanting to progress through the ranks and players arent able to actualy report people for it or at all
0;The devs stopped caring about this game a while ago. There has been bugs in the game for 3 months+ and they can only put out more crates and an update that made the game way more buggy than it was. The servers are awful and the game is dying and Psyonix knows it is so they are trying to get as much money out of this game as possible. Also the player base is one of the worst to ever be created.
0;One of those games you play again and again and don't even know why.EDIT It's not a bad game. But servers are absolute sh*t and the fact that I can only play sometimes and sometimes not because of a HCB (Heavy car bug) make me absolutly hate this game.
0;This game is a complete piece of trash. I just won in a ranked match when the whole enemy team left because we were winning and i get division down. What in the world were the developers thinking? Also when I did my placements this season I won 8/10 of my games. I was placed lower rank then I was last season. Don't bother wasting your time playing this piece of trash.
0;"""Don't buy this Got banned for 24hrs because of """"abusive voice or text chat"""". Have no idea why. Looks like those fa**ots reported me who were because I just started this game and am not as good as they are. Won't play this ever again. In fact this is the only time I'm flaming."""
0;This game has the most toxic community i have ever seen now twice in a row me and my teammate wer winning and my teammate just leaves now you'd think that the game doesn't count and my rank won't go down. but i ing did and that's why this ios the worst ghame ever ing made.It is fun with friends tho cause they aren't toxics
0;Why is this game so inconsistent with it's physics? 95% of the bounces do not make any sense whatsoever and it feels like the physics change daily. You can't tell me after 1000 hours that I am the problem. We are on version 1.42 and the physics are still garbage.
0;"""So basically it's a great game however i can't recommend this to people who are looking for """"fair"""" and """"effective"""" matchmaking this matchmaking system doesn't work whatsoever oh and the servers well it's been an entire week they're fkin up really badly so don't be afraid of loosing your rankeds because of broken servers good but broken game that's it"""
0;Excellent and very addictive game! 9/10BUT....When playing ranked matches the other team's ranks are usually superior tomy team which is completely unfair.Ranks should be identical so we can have fairer games.Devs do work hard to provide free DLC and sort bugs but this problem ishappening to me every day!UPDATE So apparently this problem was supposed to be fixed in the recent update but it's still happenning.
0;Good game and difficult mechanics to master.One downside though extremely toxic community and discouraging.Never play this game if you are ill tempered very sensitive of criticism and suffer from any mental issues as this community will hurt you severly.Other than that great game Psyonix.I do not recommend for this reason please fix your community and your bans are not helping anyone those toxic people will always come back find a way to fix this.
0;This is actually the worst game in my Library i honestly cannot tell you how i have 800 hours on it. Its probably just bc i leave this trash running. If youre looking for a competitive game to get in to I really do not recommend playing this game for kids the age 10 and under PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE dont waste your money on this garbage can of a game. The longer this game is not in your life the happier you will be trust me......
0;Game is broken and unplayable since april (tournament update).People getting packet loss alert (lags and 1 sec delay in game) depending on your internet connection.Don t think i got good internet i ll be fine. No. Even players with 18ping got it.Advice avoid. cause they care about new content not about fixing game.Reporting servers? good joke your code is more broke every update not servers
0;Dear god I used to love this game.... Played it day and night.... and now... I find it so hard to enjot the game anymore.. None of the hits make sense to me.. Everything that hits the bar and post just goes in for everyone... even if the ball is 90% above the bar... bars in. I miss this game when it released... for like the first 3 seasons... this game was amazing... What happened... '(
0;Awfull community quick chat only ever gets used for irony people look at their teamates like they are the opposition. A dying game that the makers only keep alive to suck money out of people that are willing to pay 300 euros for some in game wheels just because they are white thats right white the most boring color it's not even a color. Uninstalling
0;Once the servers and everything get fixed the game will be fine.As of right now the game is garbage. I used to never have problems but now I have problems playing online due to lag and connection issues. I am fairly certain that the issues are not on my end either.The game is going downhill fast.
0;laggest peice of you will buy and servers just keep getting worse and worse. They had a lan disconnect at an event where the winner would recieve $150 000. A ing lan disconnected from this game. A lan.... if that doesnt say it all I don't know what does.
0;"""Why are you reading this review for? The game is just great! Simple to learn hard to master! One if not the best game of 2015!It have turned to a money grab now. They forgot their community and are pressing out """"stuff"""" instead of like new arenas and such."""
0;i myself love the game its just alot like the other games now a days the community has ruinied it for me due to in game chat being so open im not saying take away the typing messages but make some type of word blocker i get i can turn off ther chat but trash talk and this stuff are no where near the same thing no one has ever trashed talked and told you to kill yourself ever but other then that i love the game well used to
0;I'm a Texan and sometimes (NOT ALL THE TIMES) but somewhat often get 300 900 ping on U.S. servers and it's only on this game. I also experience a lot of freezes.I have had this game for a few years and all of this only with the last few updates but even of the last 3 update have made it worst
0;Overall a well built game lacks alot of placement issues could use more than just causal and comp modes. If you have friends to play with comp is much fun and youll get far into ranks. If you dont like me gl your gonna need it with a toxic community like this one. And yes i am not champ because ive been slogging through ranks since season 3.
0;I like the game but i'm tired of the community. Doesn't matter how good you do you choke once you are trash. You get talked for the next few games then you get tilted because teammates and enemies keep talking you. I've had so many encounters of teammates and opposing players I can't tell you how many times i've laid into my desk to release my frustration. Please avoid this game ') God help you if you do buy it
0;A simply way to block/ignore people that I don't want to play with would of been a BIG plus...who the hell forces ppl to rejoin a game they just left 3+ times in a row?!? The camera (and it's settings) sucks such a great feature to be forced to look the opposite way or to have the cam clip outside the wall at goal. There was one more thing...the slot machine for crates...red flag for any sh t game.
0;If I'm not recommending this game is because there's no free look with mouse and keyboard while pad users get to look around with the right stick. Absurd. If you release a game in PC make it have PC controls. There's no excuse. Also the loot system is greedy.Other than that very well crafted game overall.EDIT Also leavers. Leavers everywhere.
0;As of late 2018 the game is polished and super fun but beware it's getting more and more like cs go and dota2 full of abusive kids thrashtalkers sexual beasts with mom issues etc. The game itself is cool but play it with chat set to off and without any other communication turned on. Community is becoming more and more toxic day by day especially in later gold ranks where almost everybody thinks he's a pro when reality is he can't even dribble properly.
0;Honestly its a fun and addictive game. In game purchases are purely cosmetic and provide no advantage over other players. The only problem with this game is it has probably the most toxic community ive seen. Players are constantly tauntung and harrasing each other. This game is better played with private voice chat as most of the time its just really toxic players who will harrass you unitl the game is done and many times after as well over steam messages
0;i have 716.8 hrs played i wish i never buy this sheety game...i wish i can hask for a refond but with 716.8hrs off course i cant hask such thing...in the beguining yes i was loving the game but then bahhhhhhh i was thinkink what a sheeety game i buy... this shet game..i wish it never be on steam or any place else...i hate this sheet game..yes im sorry but is a sheety game it have no sence cars playing football lolololol omg what a sheeeeeettttty game this game

0;This game is the most toxic game ever1 The devs set teh goal to make the most and toxic game they can and came with rocket br&gt 2 Never realese update with fix of the game only bump skins noone wants3 You can get sizure fro mthis game cuz the camera is so bad you cant stay focused whats going on4 The only way to win this game is only by lucky goals nothing else skills in this game are useless5 DONT BUY THIS TRASH NEVER BUY WALLPAPER ENGINE ITS WAY BETTER THAN THSI TRASH HERE
0;put over 250+ hours into this game. it used to be a great team game. now the community is 99% toxicity and ignorant players. not to mention the devs cant maintain the servers to play a session without lagg of some sort. if you want to play it to talk trash and not play then its a great game. but otherwise it has become a terrible community game and degraded team based game.
0;This game has the worst community of many games....all the people just tryharding in casual so many s thinking they are cool if they smurf tryhard and demo you.Anyone who starts the game and is a newby don't has the chance to evolve and all the players are just tryharding salty s who think they are cool if they beat u in a online game.
0;Great game I really love this game (you can tell by how many hours I've played it). However there's one major flaw the game will sometimes put your controller as Player 2 even in ranked matches when you accidentally disconect your controller the game will put you as Player 2 forcing you to switch to mouse and keyboard. The only way to fix this issue is restarting your computer. If you can fix this issue I'll give a good rating.
0;While the game itself is nice and deserves recommendation if you want to play it occasionally and mess around I cannot recommend it because of the developers. They lack creativity in everything besides adding more cosmetics. You can spend a lot of time learning the mechanics and stuff but in the end the game doesn't evolve. To make the matters worse community can be pretty toxic at times.

0;after having waited patiently for a very long time (specifically all of august) to play with my brother on xbox you release this ive played 500+ hours on xbox alone ( when i had one) and about 900+ on ps4 and now 150 on pc and personally love this game. in my top 5. buuuttttHOW ARE YOU GOING TO ABANDON YOUR COREno one wants this pass.
0;Is this a good game? Yes it is. However.It.Lacks.A ****** MANUAL RECONNECT BUTTON. Is astonishing every now and then I have short disconnections(about 1 or 2 sec). IS ASTONISHING HOW THIS GAME IS SO BAD TO DO AN AUTOMATIC RECONNECTION. IT BLOWS MY MIND. This simple things make a game bad. Imagine trying to power off your PC without mouse keyboard and the Power ON/OFF button. It's amazing.
0;"""the game is fun to play colorfull and lets you be a bit creative with the car selection and the modeling of it the reason i do not recommend it is for the simple reason that the servers are really poor it might be just in my country but i get """"packet loss"""" every game for days for no reason at all i play other games with no problem at all."""
0;Is it fun? Hell yes. It's fantastic and so satisfying when you improve.However if you're looking for a game with a ranked system which makes at least some small amount of sense don't get it.Grind your way up a rank or two over the course of a few weeks? Don't worry a few losses due to bad teammates will sort that out for you in no time.Would it be hard to make this system more fair? No. Will it happen? No.Buy the game just know that it will you off.
0;This game has garbage servers. The game itself is very good but I dont recommend getting into it because getting kicked out of competitive servers is a very common occurence. Psyonic only cares about the money and they still havent done to fix their servers with 100ms of lag BEING THE NORM
0;FIX YOUR SERVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I go to hit the ball and go right through it I'm getting latency issues with 42 Ping explain that to me. You guys make so much money on this game you can take the time to fix it stop adding trash cars to the game a focus on whats important to make your customers happy.
0;Matchmade mate is AFK at the start of the game so we get a goal scored against us.Mate still AFK during next engage.Mate gets kicked from being AFK.Wait 2 minutes for mate to come back.Mate no come back.Forfeit and move on.Queue up for another game with a different random mate.Same sh*t happens all over again.Forfeit because 1v2 is no fun.Lose my rank because very good matchmaking system.But hey at least theyll be banned 10 minutes from matchmaking.Nice.
0;Honestly when i started this game it was fun and players were fairly competent even in casual and low ranks the past two years ive played on and off each time i come back the community has gotten worse and no one can play with any sort of tactics unless you're in higher ranks. uninstalling for good after tonight this game has devolved from a casually fun game to a horribly toxic game where no one cares to play as a team and have plenty of trolls around in chats or griefing your team.
0;This game is a trash. I quit playing it. HOW CAN A GAME WHICH HAS BUILT IN TOXICITY LAST THIS MUCH??? I won't play again until they remove the fckin chat or the demolition. And the people here...pffff.... I can't understand how can you all be that bad that you can't win without being unsportsmanlike? Trash people in a toxic game just save your brain cells and your PC and quit this
0;"""Most disgusting ranking system i have ever seen everyother game you're garanteed to win. They place you against people who are far worse than you and then the next game you get placed against people who are above your skill level so that you have a """"balanced win rating"""".... Mine is literally 50.1%. Gets really fkn repetative and ruins the fun"""
0;if a videogame is sold in Steam it MUST HAVE the Steam Market and not private market becose is Full of Scammers otherwise is better Steam remove Rocket League.Sure i dont waste other money in useless Rocket League keys.oups i forgot the vary bad comunity that really hate the Italian ppl like me is better Steam remove this Garbage.The right name for this is Garbage League.
0;Bad game. Their servers suck matchmaking is broken was disconnected out of 3 matches out of 7and when I try to reconnect there will always be an error and then because I could not reconnect I will bet banned from matchmaking. Psyonix your game is actually drunk. Fix it!!!
0;This game would be great if the alternate maps weren't in the ranked play because every damn time i play i get the starbase or tokyo maps and they are the worst maps in the entire game. If the devs ever read my review then they should know that you keep those terrible maps in rumble for gods sakes.
0;"""this game is complete trash. Rocket league has implemented an automatic ban policy if you use """"offensive terms"""" it doesnt matter if your team mates grief or anything because if you use """"bad words"""" you will be banned from online play. Whatever implemented this system must have down syndrome or something severely wrong with them. Words on a ing videogame cause bans. In what pathetic world do we live in that actually speaking in a videogame constitutes bannable behaviour. devs. Kys."""
0;"""The game itself was fun before and it wasn't too bad when they added a chat ban not letting you say certain words even if i didn't like it but now that you can get your name censored just cuz its """"inappropriate"""" even if there isnt anything obsene or bad in it its stupid af. If you are getting upset and reporting over peoples usernames you might wanna uninstall."""
0;Product received for free. i like the game other than the fact every time you say anything bad like your a noob or you get banned i got banned for liek 170 hours idk what thats about but its unreasonable would buy if they fixed there abussive chat policy
0;In this game you will be banned purely if players report you. Just look at the recent sharp drop in players as they implemented this policy. This is ridiculous... Been playing this game for two years now and all of the sudden (2018) they decide to let players moderate! Does anyone really think thats a good idea?
0;I love Rocket League but I HATE Psyonix with a passion. They are more worried about releasing new items to sell than they are improving their servers half the time I can't play due to lag/rubber banding They refuse to bring Mac release out of beta and refuse to release full controller support for mac as well. I love this game but I can't ever play.

0;You like physics? You wanna calculate how the ball will move and act in condition with this? Forget it it is ing random. At start it was fun but it turned me out really fast. Ranked system is a joke if you win 5 in a row you get nothing if you lose 1 game you insta lose rank. What the hell?Finally about DLCs. You have to buy for 4 euros a fkin car? D I didnt expect that when I bought the game for 20(!) euros.Imo do not buy the game there are a lot better games for this much money.Cheers mates
0;after playing this game for a number of hours (in rank) i came to the conclusion that this game really punishes u if u are a good player. matchmaking is bad and unbalanced if u are trying to climb. It really matches u with people who are just good at fertilizing the earth when they are dead.
0;This game was made by a bunch of psychopaths who hate people and want to watch the world burn. There is so much unfair t in the physics everyone you play against seem to be hacking. When you are getting thrashed it is no fun but if you leave the match you are banned from finding any game casual or ranked for 10 mins. Playing this game has made me have serious homicidal thoughts towards Psyonix and pretty much every who plays the game.
0;Sins they put all fun game modes on ranked only i cannot recommand this game to anyone who likes to have a wide variety of fun without wanting to rip out their hair this game is extreamly punishing and frustrating even if you are an average playeri'v played this game for a long time because i like the different gamemodes it used to offer now you can only play this modes on competitive level witch kills all the fun it used to have.
0;It used to be a good game.But Psyonix don't care anymore.Micro transactions CheckToxicity without any working report system CheckUnfair ranked matches CheckUnbalanced Maps CheckI really loved this game but i feel like the more Psyonix earn money the more they start to become like EA or gold digger game companies. As fun as this game is i can't recommend it.
0;The matchmaking has become so atrocious not worth it anymore. Game used to be fun when it wasn't a complete waste of my breathe. 20+ matches before I can find one of even footing. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. 20 matches i have to sift through to find a fun match where I'm not getting skrewed over by smurfs or season 3 grand champions. Hope all the devs get on by R. kelly for ruining a good thing.
0;Always get the maps you set to dislikeAlways paired with players over 1000 hours once you hit 100 200 hoursBots are complete aidsHalf the content is DLCSkill ceiling is infinitely high due to lagged out shots imprecise control of the ball random ball physics and half the goals being random bsToxic playerbaseThere is no thinking when you play. Simply hit the ball as hard as you can toward the goal. Spending 300 hours trying to be clever and fake people out leads to disapapointment.
0;Used to be one of my favorite games and now it is literally unplayable because of the horrendous lag and ping issues. Can't get a minute into a game until my ping spikes to 200+ and i need to leave. It's been an ongoing issue for a couple months now and the developers seem to be doing absolutely nothing about. Tried asking psyonix with no reply. Pretty ridiculous
0;Probably one of the best sport games out there it gets you hyped up and its awesome to play with friends.But what it would make it better is alot of things like the ban system matchmaking and more.The match making is horryble i played tons of competitive games and i was with veterans masters and rocketeers and i am only a pro and keep getting my as$ whooped.
0;This game has one of the most toxic communities I've ever encountered in my 15 years of being a gamer. It's nothing but hateful 12 year olds and people who abrade you for winning games because apparently everyone in the silver tier deserves to be a grand champ.
0;"""Don't play this game unless you want to get your life ruined. Full of noobs calling out for """"toxic people"""" whenever you point out that they could've not made an easy mistake. Or everyone blames you for losing if you're a high ranked player even tho you can't carry a 3 men team (probably they even own goaled before calling you out for being at the game).Getting called out for boosting if you get beaten in a casual match. Whatever guys. community overall."""
0;what a server!what an update!hey guys job done! u f...ed the game compilitly Tnx!!!!!aaaaaaaaaaa one more thing is that the bot of this game can not even thouch the shadow of the ball but it it can score the owngoal. good for the developer of this pice of s..t.f...........ck you and the games that YOU STUPID develops.

So these no life rocketeers cant be plat 1 in 1s when they obviously shouldnt be it makes this game very unfair when im playing someone with double to triple my hours every game"""
0;Yet another fantastic game dragged down by exclusive content being hidden in crates. Microtransactions are the current cancer in gaming but as usual people won't see it until it's too late and we have splash screens hidden in crates with keys being 10 a go.
0;Cons I am only getting cool decals for expensive DLC cars. Matchmaking is cancer. Community is cancer. Luckshots are cancer. The audience is applauding much louder and longer when the opponent scores. I am slowly getting anger issues. My controller is broken now. Paid to get my controller destroyedPros Music is good
0;This game was so much fun when I first got it But it got boring fast between the painful boring multiplayer and the toxic players I ran into. Disagree if you want its your right. But I expect more than 20 hours of fun out of a game. Why do I have so many hours you ask? Because despite the boring nature of the game my friends and I found creative ways to make the game fun but even that has worn itself out.
0;Love the game its great to play to sometimes and its not super competetive. But the only problem is whoever is in charge of banning people like seriously 24 hour ban? for abusive chat?!?. Exactly 100% of the time it was the other person starting to talk I never said anything unless they did. Why dont you check! this game though that killed my vibe. PUBG!!!
0;"""This used to be my favorite game 'til they broke their servers after some update. Every third game or so is a game with full of t lags. They even implemented a """"Report Server"""" in the game for players to report the broken servers since they can't fix it themselves. It's been like this for a couple of months now and i've had enough. I don't recomend people buying this game at the moment because of the laggy servers. (I'm playing EU. I do not know if that's the case for other than EU)."""

Here is why you should buy the game Good concept / Good communityHere is why you shouldent The devs of this game stated when it launched that they wouldent even put dlc into the game now we have keys which have gone from 1.00$ to 1.50$ which is insane that they would increase something already making them a ton of money
0;this game is so bad i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself also un installed 44 ping but game keeps skipping not my graphics card or anything
0;This game great but then they had a competition Let's make the most map ever. The winner was this f****** Neo Tokyo map. Shoot the ball against any wall and it will land in front of ur own goal 99 99% of the time.BAAAHINDERTWHY U DO THIISSSSSSSSSSSSS MANY STUPIDO NOT WOW SUCH DISAPONTMENTEDIT ONLY LUCK IN THIS GAMEEDIT2 AND ALL PLAYERS ARE TOXIC U CAN FLAME AND NEVER GET BANNED
0;Rocket league was great. When I first started it felt very rewarding getting something every game. Now you don't get anything after 10 hour. Without any other form of reward or overarching goal to work for it's a lot easier to quit when I get into a losing streak. I don't feel like playing this game until the loot system is some form of consistent reward.
0;if i was to refund a game this would be the game. its like a joke where a person gets thrown rocks at for 5 minutes then they stop and say prank. like my friends always did to me when i was younger ) hopefully they all get beat up so badly they lose their teeth. thank you for reading this and let me blow out some steam as my life is ruined by all the scars on my face.
0;Great game but matchmaking and some bugs. Always getting those ballchasing and unskilled dogs... I really wish they would get banned. Can't be that i get 3 times in a row the same mate who can't play a single pass or rotate. Also the points system is a little bit buggy. A small example of what I mean https //www.youtube.com/watch?v EMsBg9aC0BI
0;4/10such a ing trash matchmaking in this game400h something like gold plat and getting matchmade with 1700h rocketeers from diamond+ every 1v1 gameyou cant really have fun in this game until you are the one who has more experience in the gamei promise youll get tilted asf after losing few goals to a 2000+ hours player that you are playing against when being a typical 200h 0 experience player
0;I have owned this game for PS4 previously before getting it for PC so all in I've around 200 hours. Community is toxic teamwork is non existant. Guy who talks thrash throughout some games is usually the worst player. There is only one style of match usually Team A constantly attacks while Team B counter attacks which results in Team A losing 90% of the time. The better you get the worse the experience gets. Avoid if you want stress free free time.
0;support isnt worth a crap just automated they dont even reach back out to you . got a one day ban for saying somthing back after being bullied all game . personally have played this game a bunch its rather clunky now . and personally imma just play somthing else i wouldnt recommend this to anyone but thats just me imma go play somthing else . only buy it on sale if u do
0;okay i wanna know. how tf do u have deep pockets but cant fix the servers. like dont u have enough funds to fix your game. ffs. fix this i have spent more than 50$ on this game. i expect better preformance. so start working instead of drinking bear and watching football. fkin hell.
0;Poor game with high rng based gameplay...and it keeps kick you from matches whitowt any reasson and after that you enter back and loss all your stats and stuff....dont buy it pls!Instead you can buy Overwatch or something better whit 20 eurosSee ya guys!
0;At its current state i would not recommend it. Latest update messed it up a bit. Specifically the server issues lately are ridiculous.Written at 1915 hours totalFeel free to play the game if you're a casual player and don't seek to play this game on a competitive level.
0;1.semi pro vs veteran 1v1 _ everytime _ like.. cmon2.no community market and official prices3.no gambling sites 4.some players have disadvantages5.some items shall cost more and some shall not6.max items u can trade in 1 trade is only 30 so u most likely get scammed with 30+ items
0;This game died when it started helping people beat you which it lierally does it helps people beat you by giving them fake goals like physics intentionally allowing people to score goals that makes no senseThis game died years ago don't buy it even if its on sale its a rage simulator for even the calmest gamerJust being honest.Community toxicaudience kids/50 year oldsskill gap Non existant that died years ago too
0;"""Really Psyonix? Banning people from online gameplay for being """"offensive""""?Get your head in the 21st Century. If some 12 year old takes offense at general banter then said 12 year old shouldn't be playing the games. The rest of us understand what banter is.Great game but unfortunately the Dev's have seriously poor mentality."""
0;Psyonix is a stupid ing who sucks at creating a game where you can have fun while being able to call stupid ing s who int lose the game. get banned for calling a dumb ing idiot a but dont get banend for inting. when will game creators realize the gaming community is toxic as so let people call them s and add an option into the game where you can block that type of talk. off with punishing people for getting off at stupid who int the game. this and all games who punish for toxic language.
0;Product received for free. I am carrying my teammate and he leave game and I division down its unfair. This game's ban system is not working and tilted players everywhere if you love yourself don't play this game because usually who play this game's ranked like most players have a rank that they don't deserve and I'm sure you will be one of them. I played this game for 600 hours and I feel I like I wasted my time
0;Dont buy it if you have bad internet if you leave you will get automatically instabanned.I got banned for 5 min just for being away in 10 20 seconds thats Buy H1Z1 or csgo much more recommended you dont get banned there for any connection issues.Reviewed by.Maxim // Maxim Nsteamcommunity/id/maximation
0;Absolute . Worst community I have ever encountered psyonix gives a huge platform to toxic players. I do not even know why the hell I am still playing this game. Most of the time winning does not even depend on skill it depends on who you get as a teammate and how much luck your enemy has. Time to change something if a player that devoted half a thousand hours to your game is off because you treat your players unfair and cannot even optimize a game so that the most skillful player wins.
0;"""The match making sucks and getting people that can hit an open ball shouldn't be a problem with """"finding players near your level"""" does jack Also if the game is """"searching for player"""" in competitive ing forget it as it will soon say """"not enough players to start a match"""" lol"""
0;Garbage game just keep getting banned while trying to have fun cant believe they still take this old game seriously. Dont play this game if youre planning on talking to the other team because it will lead to you getting banned some how some way. Apparently cant even call someone stupid without getting a 72 hour ban. Dumb game dont buy
0;I have massively enjoyed this game up until the most recent patch. Until now the DLC system for this game has been great cosmetic packs of a couple cars and accessories. However the newest update brings in a crate system which locks a ton of new content behind gambling away real money. Personally I can't recommend a game that does something like this especially after they've had a perfectly good system in place.
0;Ranked match making system does a terrible job matching you with people of the same skill. Someone with 2hours playtime can be matched with people who have hundreds and they run circles around the poor newcomers.The casual gameplay is much more fun but thumbs down for giving me terrible teammates in ranked.
0;"""Psyonix is crap and gives bans because I """"offended"""" some ten year old by saying """"kys"""" after he's saying he's gonna my mom and I think it's ultimately stupid because no other game I've played is so flakey when it comes to bans. Maybe when psyonix changes that I'll give them a higher rating but for now it's 1 out of 5."""
0;Everything about this game is fun except its cancerous community. I am apart of the cancerous community and will remain that way for the foreseeable future but I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.&gt Great Review!&gt Great Review!&gt Great Review!&gt Great Review!0/5 would sarcasm again
0;you your dumbass matchmaking system this game i hope you all ing die slowly in a fire bunch of .And i hope all of your familys die from cancer.I CAN NOT WIN A SINGLE ING GAME BECAUSE YOU KEEP PUTING ME AGAINST 3 PREMADE LEGENDS AND MASTERS AND IM PLAYING WITH PEOPLE WHO DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS GAME IS.99% OF THE TIME I WON I WAS THE MVP AND I DID EVERYTHING AND YOU ALWAYS PUT ME WITH ING AUTISTIC IDIOTS WHO KEEP FAILING AT EASY SAVES AND KEEP SCORING OWN GOALS.
0;this game has great potential but they have tried to update it and make it so flashy that lower end computers cannot keep up with the smooth quality of higher end computers. You will also need really good internet. You will look like you are hitting he ball but then suddenly your opponent is there and the ball is going the opposite direction. Good game terrible graphics. PLease fix so that everyone plays with a smooth quality
0;tryyying to get my rank at the start of the season the whole 32 ping but still getting the ing disconnect sign 24/7 doesn't fukkkking help with my rank there's 3 games lost because you are ing dumb every other game a o k but nope not rl I deserve champ for that fuk u game
0;Bans start once you start up the game for the first time after being banned. Even if someone is being a it's 2018 so you can't say anything anymore without getting the stake. Sincerely hope Psyonix kicks their stools for continuing down this path of reducing our species to a bunch of sensitive mouth breathers that attack anything white or straight.
0;used to be fun now just full of ugly virgin nerds that dance and dribble the ball at the same time even if you put alotta effort these virgins just hit the ball out of the air ground no matter which angle and everything. game community not fun anymore.
0;The recent update just nuked matchmaking. Welcome to games where you get matched agains last seasons best players. Spoiler alert They will destroy you.So for a few months until it rebalances itself through the matches I won't have fun playing heck I'll go without playing then.
0;"""Don't buy this game. Ranked system is just a sh** playing with people one and a half leagues over you (being impossible to win) or one league under you (being absolutelly pros).Besides that report system is so funny. You can get banned using the premade comments created by Rocket League but when you report """"get cancer"""" """"go fu** yourself"""" or so there are no consequences.DON'T PAY FOR THIS GAME."""
0;This game is trash only because the community is so toxic and they made everything competitive that was fun about the game ie hockey dropshot rumble etc. Diamond 1 on hockey and most of the time you get trash team mates or a team of tryhards queing together so it is way too easy to downrank. Hiding your rank is possible but that's more of a band aid. You gotta keep'em seperated...good song.
0;this game was great to start off but with their competition with fortnite it just ruined the game instead of going free like fortnite they keep the game at full price AND introduce a rip off of the battle pass which no one asked for as you should get this free as the game is full price fortnite is a free game it is fine for a battle pass this game is going the wrong direction isntead of releasing more skins and money grabbing crates which literally n one asked for they should fix their game.
0;I regret ever supporting this game and psyonix. Ban happy s. Ive never gotten so much as a warning in any other online gameplay/interaction and 18 hours match time later i have a 24 hour ban just ridiculous not to mention the ing timer doesnt even start till i open the game up almost 12 hours after i last played. Now i know thats not really related but what a ing way to hand out punishments.
0;Right now I cant recommend this game.They broke itBefore the update I was fine but now with 50 ping I lag everywhere I teleport all over the map I would be in my goal sitting then suddenly It starts lagging and im in the air near his goal without even moving.One example is that the ball was infront of the other teams goal I slam it in suddenly I get teleported back and they get a goal. If they fix their horrible servers then I will change my review.
0;This game is pretty dissapointing when you play it it's super fun but if you attempt rank it just always seems to put you against higher ranks and when you finally aren't you play an unranked and win then you don't even go up in the rank system it's obnoxious and just impossible to climb ranks so I don't recommend playing ranked
0;"""banned for 24 hours for verbal abuse? lmao. Because someone got their feelings hurt when they started trash talkin me first? LOL """"I need a safe space."""" wow Welp. back to PubG too bad felt like playin RL today. guess not. Me and my buddies play pubg more anyways. Toxic community + overzealous moderators GG"""
0;I had initially given a positive review for this game.It still is good the issue is that the devs don't seem focused on fixing the massive fps drops thir game has.Such an issue renders the game almost entirely playable and at best a hindrance to play.Fix this Psyonix!
0;This game is fun at first but when you get better at the game you soon learn the foreign developers have never taken a math class. Their matching system will put you with beginners against PRO's and you will have a 90% chance of loosing. Not fun knowing your gonna loose before the match begins. They have attempted their math skills on this match system a few time and is a TOTAL failure. Good luck
0;+Nice game to have fun with a friend Worst camera and ball physics ever created in gaming history. If you reach a high level you play with very good opponents so never a chance to win Servers are bad you just have high ms randomly and you cant control your car Afk players and leavers all time with no penalty cause its not a game to take seriously Flamers and bad language in voice chat and no penalty for salty players.Report button is just for show..
0;"""Do I really have to resort to this?Unfortunately I do. RL has a new map called """"Wasteland."""" It is much different than all other fields as it is curved like a half pipe. Yes this COMPLETELY changes the game.Unfortunately Psyonix puts this map into the rotation just like any other map including ranked mode.It absolutely ruins the game. Devs won't listen. Maybe they will if enough of us downvote."""
0;One of the worst community in gaming toxic in almost every game used to love this game but it has ruined it for me.. Don't buy unless you have a buddy or 2 to play with. Also Psyonix has one of the worst support in the industry if you write them an email because they will never answer you they're busier making new crates to sell than fixing their game
0;Competitive can be fun except for when you get maps like neo tokyo and starbase striker even though both teams have it disliked and about 90% of players dislike it. They need to get those maps out of the competitive pool or give people a definite option of what they are going to play.
0;Playing this game since 2009. Loved it back then. People were pretty enthousiast with it.Now I have to give a negative review because the amount of toxicity in the childish community ruins half the fun of the game. Until there is a serious ban system for the toxic...
0;Ok. why the hell would you ban someone like me. i play your game and have spent money on your game. Some salty 8 year old that lost to me reported me to you. Then i get banned during one of your events. fix your phyonix. Your report feture sucks. If i beat someone and they get their little friends to report me i get banned. Screw this you need to fix it. i have enjoyed your game but now i know that if i beat someone i have a chance to get banned. WTF is this? FIX IT
0;Literally like playing CSGO or COD When playing ranked...full of fake ranking boosted idiots they claim to ban boosters and trollers and also claim to fix the matchmaking and rankiing systems every season but it's still the same every single ing season full of boosted . And the new demo system is absolutley ing ...you can have somone drive infront of you on the side of their can you get demo'd for it what the physics is that psyonix ing learn common sense !
0;Not sure what it is about this game. I have super low ping. Low settings for performance. Yet everytime an action occurs in the game Players hit the ball goal is scored even when audio is cued it shows a network disconnect and lags. Makes it barely playable. Never again.
0;"""IM SORRY BUT I LOVE THING GAME BUT the thing is I CANT PLAY IT!!!! the game says """"Stopping"""" AND ITS FOROZE FOR OVER 3 WEEKS!! FIX IT OR I WILL ACTUALY TELL everyone that the games not worth it!! im sorry i dont want to have to but iv bought the game and a DLC pack iv spent like 20 pounds on this game!!!!! PLEASE FIX IT STEAM OR ROCKET LEAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""
0;This game is so annoying. This dude named kobe always talk it drives me crazy so i had to uninstall. Its kinda like bullying. YOu call a girl ugly once its okay but when you do it over and over she becomes hannah baker. Thats how i feel. Makes the motivation to get better non existant because kobe always talking so im done.
0;It doesn t matter how good you are in this game! There are 98% players that have more luck than you so refund it when you can! Dont fu*k your life.. Dont buy it.... Higher you are in rank system &gt more apes in your team ) That's pretty nice when you are on plat 3 and mate in your team scores 20 points after whole 5 minutes )
0;"""One of the most Toxic ridden games i've ever played. It starts of fine &amp ya have a laugh. But later on ranked is a horrid mess of people throwing curses &amp jokes about """"your mother""""Would not reccomend if you would like to keep your sanity.P.S the servers are actual potatoe powered &amp couldn't keep a stable ping if they tried."""
0;Game is good but average age is 10 y. So kids are often salty af why cant Psyonix just remove chat ?????????? And also when u play competitive mm there are some people who dont deserve their rank and it is really frustrating when u get in 3v3 teammate with decent rank but he cant play..
0;PLEASE Fix the teammate pairing in ranked I am constantly getting paired with complete IDIOTS and players who are not on the same level of skill as the rest of the players in the match. Losing 10 games in a row is not fun whatsoever. If this is improved the game would be perfect but until then it is almost impossible to win without playing with a friend of the same skill level.
0;Stupid game with stupid f****** system when in other team with party somebody have friend with blue/gold star rank and only what you do in match miss a goal! Goal after goal.. goal after goal... YEAH! GOOD F****** GAME! NICE PLAY!! F*** stupid developers of this game!!
0;I don t recomended this game cause i t has high ping copmetitive servers as a result you can t play. also in competitive mode you don t play with players in you skill group as a lot of them are unranked. No matter if they were champion in the other season
0;game is very good I like it If you want to play with your friends online you should have this because it's cool BUT if you are like me having 3 controllers and 3 monitors you can not play eachplayer with one monitor it got some weird resolution like 50% of the screen to the first player 25% to the second 25% to the third and you can't do any thing to make it fit like each player to his on monitor if they add some kind of split screen setup staff in the next update it will be great
0;Rocket league huh? Yeah the game is awesome when u first start out. Its all fun and games but when u start to get better u get anoyed wint ranking system and pretty teammates. They cant hit it or cross it or fail at flights. U get more and more nervous as the game progresses and u just end up being mad at the game witch is esentialy just cars and balls.. If u are good u are gonna carry or get carryed. thats it.
0;This game ing suck you win you dont rank up you lose you rank down + evry time get retard and play 2 v 1 they dont have good ranking sistem that problem off this game so dont buyed if you dont have some one to play because its suck I just hate this game loot of bugs and like I say ranking sistem and ALL!!!
0;I loved rocket league A LOT. I played it pretty much since it came out on PC but with the recent actions from Psyonix and now the crate and key system being shoved into the game. I'm not going to play this game anymore and have uninstalled. I don't regret the time I put into this game I just wish they didn't ing ruin it like this.
0;DONT BUY THIS GAME... ITS A LUCK BASED GAME UNTIL YOU WASTE 2000 HOURS ON IT PEOPEL GET SO LUCKY AND TOXIC ITS LITERALLY THE WORST GAME LIKE NO JOKE AND IF U WASTED 19.99 ON THIS GAME UNINSTALL BEFORE YOU GET UR MONITOR/COMPUTER BROKEN FROM THE TOXIDITY AND LUCK OF THIS GAME... I HOPE STEAM BANS GAMES LIKE THESE
0;"""For god sake fix the goddamn matchmaking! Every time i join someone they are either Veteran or Expert. I am PRO. Dont say """" Maybe you are playing with people in your skill group"""" NO... Its the same as Black ops. ITs RANDOM. If you are a PRospect 3 then you play against Prospect 3. They can either be a lvl 60 50 40 or 75+..."""
0;Awesome game but the matchmaking system is so screwed. Me and my friends (all prospect 3 semi pros or pros) are consistently matched up with challengers whole teams of veterans and experts. I'm not sure if it's people boosting or the matchmaking system is broken. I will upload screenshots to my profile next time I get fingerbanged by a guy with 2000 hours just to prove it. Solid game though would reccomend if it didn't make me want to snap my own neck.
0;Adicting as hell. Most players don't play like it's a team game though...they hog the ball and even take goals away from you. They think the object is to hit the ball no matter what. Frustrating when you are about to score and your own team mate knocks it off course. The players ruin what would be an awsome game.
0;"""Im sadly writing this review after what seems like a lifetime. I have gave this game so so so so so so many chances in giving me a save for an actual save as ALL THIS GAME DOES IT GIVE ME A CLEARRRRR BALL WHEN i decerved a save. Do not recommend suck my nut ( left ). """")"""
0;"""My favorite game up untill the 1.39 patch since then nothing but stutters and bugs up untill the point where I cannot enjoy this game anymore. Nowadays Psyonix keeps focusing on all the """"goofy"""" updates and worthless crates instead of the core game which is now unplayable."""
0;The game play is great. However I don't spend on crates anymore because you just get ed. We already spent at least $10 40 on the game. Now the keys are what $1.50 for each. Rip off. Also Fix match making I get pinned with two rookies on my team versus three vets. Im a pro. with two rookies versus three vets.
0;Awesome concept even fun to play and hours of endless fun. Devs are fagggots though. Only reason I won't give them the upvote. Cashgrabbers at its finest. Plus they just aren't great at making their games solid. Wish that a different company had this idea so this game could be even greater.
0;game used to be fun now its full of toxic players trolls and boosted idiots.ingame report is just a joke dev doesnt even care aslong as they make money of these idiots noone gets banned so why the report button is in game noone knows server crash derank and ban. which happens way to often latelywould i recommend it to anyone i used too but not anymore. matchmaking is a joke and still not fixed.wanna have fun go look somewhere else.
0;The servers are laggy the ranking system makes no sense...I have to win 2 games to division up but I division down if I lose one game...and the game I divisioned down in I got the most points out of every single person playing. Plus the servers crash all the time. Don't get this game.
0;ABSOLUTELY AWFUL GAME DO NOT BUY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. ITS ADDICTIVE AS BUT VERY BAD LIKE HEROIN WITHOUT THE BRIEF SATISFACTION. YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF IN A LOT OF PAIN IF YOU PLAY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE EXPOSED TO A MILLION TIMES MORE T THAN YOU WOULD BE NORMALLY. YOU WILL LOSE GAMES DESPITE BEING THE CLEAR WINNER. YOU WILL OPEN CASES AND LOSE MONEY. YOU WILL SMASH YOUR ING DESK AS HARD AS YOU CAN. DONT BUY THIS GAME
0;i have played rocket league for 50 hours and the ranking system is so ing bad because my friend lost 3/10 matches and got silver 3 and got less goals in his matches than me while i won 7/10 with many goals but still he got a better rank so i do not reccomend this game for ompetetive player this game can off
0;Yeah this game. Honestly pretty good as far as fun and money's worth but then you get BANNED from not only competitive but ANY online play any time you say anything that is even slightly out of the PG language. I am currently banned now for a WEEK for saying &amp quot quot after I missed a save.. this game is out to me. Hey Rocket League developers that thought this was a good idea THIS IS THE INTERNET. TELL YOUR 6 YEAR OLDS TO STAY OFF YOUR COMPUTER!
0;"""psyonix gotta stop being little and stop giving bans for 24 hours 1 week etc just for saying the f word but instead fix your god awful ranking and partner system. Im a champion and get paired up with gold rank or plat. stop being soft because i said without the intention of ranting or thretening. i missed a goal and wrote """"i ing messed that up lol"""""""
0;hey idiot that made rocket league i got silver 2 rank i i ing boost my teamates i ing run on the walls and do goeal and ing flying you idiot ing give me better rank my teamate that i like boost got gold 2 and he cant even hit the ball when its on the ground
0;game is hit boxes are garbage there are terrible game mechanics this game is a luck based game no skills are involved when you can pinch a ball on the corner and it suddenly makes it to goal i play it still i have no idea but this game is and has brought my stress level super high because of the mechanics. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!
0;Worst game I've ever played in terms of ping advantage.I have constant 60 80ms on European servers and every time I duel someone with a substantial lower ping (20 40ms) It's just way too hard for me.They always hit the ball first AND it always goes to my side of the field when going head to head They always hit the ball when they didn't even touch it Please fix your crap otherwise I can't enjoy the game properly
0;First off this game is great dont get me wrong and you can have alot of fun with it. The real problem is the community it toxic as crap. If your not playing some try hard up tight kids spamming over the mic everytime something happens its the trolls you get paired with that just run into you so you can do anything and if your playing ranked say goodbye to your score.
0;This Game is the worst Game i've ever played in my entire life. So iam Bronze I on 3 vs 3 Standart and on 3 vs 3 iam Platinum I iam playing like Diamond. Now iam stuck in Bronze cause my Mates are bumping me ever single time! So worst Game I ever played.
0;if youre going to make a game like this make it free. there is so much to buy and pay for in this game its ridiculous. and if you hit the ball first it will never go in you favor. the hitting mechanics and ball movement mechanics are off entirely and it needs to be fixed. i would not reccommend spending 20 dollars on this game as id rather you put it into a gram of some kush.
0;You know it was a real nice game until it decided that it doesnt want me to play it by banning me from matchmaking.Why did it ban me? It crashed. Multiple times. And now since the game crashed i have a 40 minute ban from matchmaking.That's just great. And this isnt a one time thing either you only get a 40 minute ban from leaving multiple times. it crashed 6 times in a matter of 5 hours. multiple bans of increasing severity each time. So psyonix dont ing ban people for YOUR game crashing thanks
0;This game is absolute garbage. I have no idea why I bought it a year ago. You play with someone who is a gold and you are platinum you are then matchmade with GRAND CHAMPS i repeat GRAND CHAMPS. You will not succeed in this game unless you spend more time in training then you do playing against real people.Why did i spend 900 hours in this game...
0;this game is complete trash.banning and suspending u for swearing for being a diffrent person for not being like every other that keeps his anger inside just because he knows if he swears he will get banned.This game playerbase is complete trash.These fake people are so disguisting.PLS stop bannon people for swearing they're just natural
0;Literally the laggiest glitchiest monstrosity of a game i've ever had the misfortune of liking.Sort your game out before you add pointless DLC with no point or meaning 4 ultra rares that i can craft anyway how is that rare...the certified item level counter doesnt even work properly thats literally counting and you can't get that right..it's a disgrace that you charge people money for this crap
0;For the hours i played this game I notice the ranking seems to be riggedThey need to fix the servers because people i know are always lagging or being teleported everywhere the same as me and last season i got reportedly banned for Reporting others Also they need to get rid of smurfs because they are way too annoyingAlso please Psyonix just fix servers so they can runand make it where you can party with other consoles
0;The basic game of Rocket League is quite entertaining with good physics and a decent learning curve however at the heart of it is the online competition and I have to say there are many unpleasant people playing the game who become aggressive and offensive if things aren't going their way. I say this having reached expert level and challenger elite in ranked play.Decent game let down by the community
0;"""Want to rank up in Rocket League in 2v2 or 3v3? Don't have a mate? """"hahahahahahahhahahahaha""""Psyonix manages to pair you up with and quite literally the dumbest ing people walking the planet.Never I repeat NEVER queue up for doubles or standard alone. There's a 150% chance you'll wind up with at least one humongous retard. If you're really unfortunate you'll wind up with two.Psyonix has got to fix the ing pairing system this is ridiculous. you."""
0;This game starts out fun but the current matchmaking ranking distribution and online community are utterly toxic. I'm sick of it being near the end of a competitive season and still playing unranked players who are way better than I am not to mention half the players in each skill bracket range from idiots to prodigies and it's a cointoss who you get to play. If you want a game to sink large amounts of time into in the hope to get better go play Civilization instead.
0;The matchmaking is absolutely terrible. I always get absolute teammates and I'm just expected to carry them? Why can't you put me with someone of the same skill level on my team? Psyonix needs to fix this because I can't do it anymore. Don't waste your time on this game the majority of people are complete idiots.
0;Stupid Psyonix why are you forcing us to play these stupid new non standard levels?!?!?! Even with the new stupid arena preferences (which only let you dislike 2 arenas max) it'll often put me on a disliked arena multiple times in a row!!!! AGHHHHH YOU KILLED A GREAT GAME!!!!!
0;I would love to say this game is great and fun and engaging because it is. But there's one small little problem.It appears that the developers are pussays! You can't say one single remotely vulgar thing without getting a ban in a game with servers that don't work 1/2 the time and a demo mechanic that is pretty hit or miss (even when you actually hit them). I'll stick to games that don't restrict your vocabulary (unless you're being excessive) and with consistent servers.
0;today i got a 24 hour ban for using too many rude words and that's just not on. i apologise profusely for my disgusting behaivour and will ensure all future online gaming interactions will be 100% clean and wholesomejust kidding never playing this trash again
0;This game is absolutely amazing..... however dont buy this unless you have a group of friends that will play with you consistently because this community is the biggest piece of i have ever seen. i rarely get a game with someone who is nice and everyone will chirp you over the smallest mistake even though they will make the same ones... didnt know that everyone on here was a pro....
0;It is good if you have friends to play it with. But if you dont then you will get put into games with people with no common sense. And this game should be put as a early access because it clearly has flaws like the steering the lag issues and the people with no common sense. I mean if you have a teamate dont go for the ball when they have a better shot then you.
0;everytime they update this ing game it becomes a big pile of cant even play a nomal map anymore a woman probably designed the new ones shes probably sucking the bosses so they figured they'd throw it in plus the players are all csgo s who are done with that glove opening game aswell
0;This game is awesome however the ranking system is broken af. I don't understand how I can win a game by 7 points and my ranking doesn't change. Then I get beat by 1 point to someone (or some team) that is technically better than I am by 3 or 4 divisions (sometimes 5) and I go down by 2 or 3 divisions. Makes no sense man. Again love the game but the ranking system needs A LOT of work.
0;It wouldnt be bad infact it would be great if the ranking system was better.I have seen rookies against veterans.. to get to veteran you have to play ALOT.This simply is not fair and a main reason I will no longer play as there is no point to play without a good multiplayer experience. If they can get it together and fix their VERY BAD ranking system I might come back.
0;Dear cu c k ing god your ai is a pice of s* hi** t. May have made it onto console big woop but there's no reason to play if you can't reliably practice before getting your a %ss handed to you online. This game should've had way more work done before it was released publicly
0;the worst was fun but people are % tty and match making is terrible. i played this game for years and its kinda just bull#$% now uninstalled it cause it was complete bull crap. me being a veteran being placed with legends and masters its just not fun and i cant get better when people just on me in play of the game and over chat.
0;this game is a bunch of wank and it can suck my big fat hairy just get bull ed all the time hit the ball and just s off in the other ing way so game dont bye the cuntting game no worth the money gonna uninstall the and never play it again.ps ING GAME DONT BYE THEY WILL MUG YOU OFF
0;Oh i am sorry? i was better than you so you had to ram me for your rocketleague win and talk trash i talk trash back but i get reported cool game wanna know what is also cool being treated like your in jail no talking no quick comments take away titles and make me unlock the cars again. Just because i said some bad words to a griefing opposing team sorry rocket league but i think i will treat this game as you treat me. We can both guess what that is.
0;I Love This Game It Brings Me Back Everday However That Being Said If You're New And Plan On Playing Online Don't Buy. The Reason For This Being That Since The Game Has Controller Supoort And Is On Console You Can PLay Against People Who Have Hundreds Of Hours But None On PC But Can Play LIke They Would On Console
0;Around 1400 hours and can tell you the game is fun at first but not worth the time investment to get good at it or go pro.The Devs are a really poor community and don't really listen to feedback. The game atm is going no where.If you want something to waste a few hours on go for it.Want to be pro or good like the guys in tourney's then don't waste your time your roughly looking at like 2000+ hours of gameplay.
0;repetitive gameplay unfair matchmaking specially solo standard can mix up rockteers who have more than 1000 hours with pros who have less than 200 only 5 hitbox standards used on all cars (cars visibly different) worst servers in an online game (psyonix only cares about crates ) .
0;Rocket League likes to ban people from online playits realy fun game....if you don't mind being banned for your religionvery cool of you for banning people for being jews RLsmoothcan't wait for you to ban me for being black next ing racists running RL
0;Great game played often 435.7hrs on record so far... Logged in today &lt Sept 6th 2018&gt saw battlepass system similar to Fortnite and few other games Noped back out and wrote this. &lt P.S I was a regular key buyer to pay for what i played after initial purchase and get neat things out of crate&gt Will not play so long as battlepass is around )
0;"""Another game ran into the gutter. Every time I log in to play which admittedly is rare these days because well it's just sits looking for games and never finds anything. This has happened consistently over the last 6 months or so every time. Just did yet another 1GB patch and lo and behold sits at """"finding match"""" for 5+ minutes until I just give up. No reason to keep this junk on the hdd anymore."""
0;This could be fun but... Matchmaking is full of bugs. Allways when you start game the first game is ping 300 400. Or it cant find any games for you. Or it finds but game was cancelled because of something. Im so tired for this i'll play something else.Edit Now i tried with mac and it's even worse in there you cant find any servers.Don't buy this it's just waste of money.Update Going better and better but still bugs maybe it's good game now and you can buy it ).
0;Has potential but matchmaking and ranked system is horrible. Matches lower level players with higher and tends to stack the teams. Almost every game is one sided. If you want competition stay far far away. If you want to play on occasional non ranked game with teammates that will make you question humanity then look no farther.
0;Why is it that your server updates makes things worse? the server used to be fine but now i lag every 3 5 seconds!Also when will you make an actual match up system me and my friend are experts and we were going against legends and rocketeers that were way out of our skill level!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;The base game it started with was great but since then they are only grasping at straws. Making gimmicky maps with barely of what made it so good.The players are to distinct and for pc its just poor it still requires a controller to be played properly.As a plc user i do not recommend it and only get it if it has a discount to keep you busy for a while but don't expect anything serious of it.
0;"""Hello my name is Daniel Grunt and I'm a game reviewer!When i first bought this game i was confused! I was playing with these so called """" """" they were ps4 and xbox players that i believe should not be able to play with us high class Steam players! all the ps4 players they r ing gay honestly... Sorry for that language! I just had to get it out xD!! Sionix or whatever the it is u need to removed ps4 players they are cancer and need to die tbh not gonna lie. Sincurly Daniel peece out homies"""
0;You can't trust your money to Psyonix.My steam account got stolen with the sole intention of someone taking all of my items that I had earned and purchased through loot crates.A lot of time and money went into this game and they don't care at all that all my items were taken against my will.You cannot trust that your hard earned money is secure on items bought within this title.
0;Worst Games Ive Ever Played. Triple Digit Ping Servers People all over the world connecting to US Servers Virgin COmpany who is currently going out of buisness. Same Game over the years nothings changed. All new Content is Paid For Same Maps for 20 years LOL Dead Game not worth 10 cents compared to other f2p games out there. Dont invest time and money on this pos game its so fkn bad LOL
0;i believe that boats are a soon coming addition to this game look at the proof aquadome aquadome cars that are similar to boats. as soon as the developers stop acting like a puss puss and actually add boats to this game then it gets the thumbs up from me.
0;Great game but recently ive been getting crashes. I would be playing ranked which isnt a good time for bugs to be appearing and i would get a green screen for 20 seconds then i would go back into the game. Its happened enough for me to write this review. please fix or I will have to stop playing.
0;I like this game but I can't recommend it especially if you plan on playing the comp matchmaking. Players drop out leading to 3v1 games at the lower skill levels and it's impossible to get enough wins to get out of that and to a league where people care about positional play. Really unfortunate since the other gamemodes are fun.The game also has severe connection issues.
0;nOT A good game. Always get teamed up with that block my shots. The game has adopted the CSGO skin system and it is I remember when I used to actually unlock cool stuff after a game. Now everything that is cool is in a case and the chance of getting it is smaller than my
0;Did You Do Anything To MatchmakingDid you do anything to matchmaking in the last update? Cause before the update i was a challenger 1 and now im suspect II. Every match I get like 3 goals and my teammates gets 0. ALL THE FREAKIN TIME. I only get matched up with guys with no skills. Rocket league is not recommended before this is fixed!
0;blocks you from joining a new game just because your old game disconnected fpr no ing reason. and no its not my fault. never had problems. two players on my team disconnected at the exact same moment. so go yourself and rot in hell you stinking bastards
0;With every update game gets more p2w.Different cars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses.Not all cars are unlocked if you want all cars you will have to buy DLCs which cost money or you will have to get cars through opening crates or trading which is if you aren't willing to spend money tedious as hell.
0;Game is fun...But do to server speeds it ruins the game.You have to learn how to play against the server rather than the player. When you hit the ball last and higher doesn't mean the ball will travel forward. Most of the time it becomes a random 50 50 hit.Fun game to play with Friends. But when you get to competitive if you have any sports experence you will be disappointed.
0;Literally the worst ranking system I've ever experienced. I win 3 games lost 1 game and derank 2 divisions. Oh... then I win 5 in a row and DERANK. Every since this game has come out I've insisted that the ranking system is broke. If I could have refunded this game knowing how it would be I would have done so in a heartbeat. I don't write many reviews but when I do it's because a game literally sucks so much that it should be deleted.
0;Garbage dead game Servers are absolute garbage. Why bother trying to play when all that happens is a connection affecting EVERYONE in the game. Tweet/contact support for them to tell you its your ISPs issue. Get bent would refund this pile of steaming if I could. Save yourself some money and download a free mobile version. They actually ing work unlike this rotting corpse of a game. 0/10
0;"""Pro. Good game lots of hours love it 2 much fun even with the amount of noobs.Con. Payed full price for the game + all dlcs. Now the """"Collectors editon"""" is cheaper..... sorry but this is a RIGHT slap in the face for people who have supported the game since release"""
0;Sorry but its like rolling a dice trying to predict the bounce(seems like when you are loosing its try to gives you better oportunities to shoot) and getting an straight shoot its tricky so if you are near the ball you can roll in circles and the rival can easy gets the ball.... so annoying.... the game is fun at certain point... this game will get more on a free to play buisness model i think
0;Worst game you will ever play when the servers aren't crashing and you are losing all your progress for that game the game will bug and leave you without a HUD worst game to play competitively if at all. i would rate it 1/10 it is just all round terrible and all they want is your money
0;So apparently you can't say to someone that a game was easy or anything like that otherwise you get a 24h ban. I had just arrived home with a 10 paysafecard that I was actually gonna use on RL to buy some cases but I learned my lesson I will never spend a cent on this game again.Over 500h played and I get a 24h ban for saying just average harmless stuff k.
0;I'm deeply disappointed of the developers of this game. They said the game was going to be released to mac clients by the end of the new year and still it has not been released.I bought the game solely in hope of being able to play it once it got out but now they are so far behind schedule that I gave up hope. Truly disappointed bad job.
0;They've ruined the game since introducing the second season. The game used to be a lot of fun and you could actually track your process of ranking up. Now if you lose one game for every four you win you'll still de rank. The match making is some of the worst I've seen does not seem to make any sense what so ever. I cannot reccomend this game to any one anymore. I had hoped the devs would have done something by now but its clear they don't care.
0;Toxic game. Do not let your kids anywhere near this game. Abuse sucide and depre4ssion is all that will come of it. Steer well clear money hungry game. No support what so ever 4th Day of trying to contact them nothing. Bet if i add my credit card number they snap that up in a second. Much better options out there. Also there now under investigation for random missing items and bans for no reason steer clear guys.
0;Got banned for a week for being abusive to other players. Wtf why would you get banned for insulting others.And the worst part is that a ban literally bans online play for you that means no casual matches no private matches with friends well basically nothing you can play after that except bot games you know the devs could give you a competetive ban wich would be actually a smart decision but no the devs are just s. This is stupid the developers are stupid. this game dont buy it
0;crap game so fustrating nothing drops played 12 hours since update no crates wat a load of crap wen they do its players chioce great pay to get gud stuff like usual makes the game no fun well done. mate has played it for about 3 hours today an got 3 new crates yeah great system and matchmaking still crap cant play unranked as 75% of games get cancelled wasting your time pointless.
0;Worst game I've ever played hands down. You looking for teamates? You've come to the right game. Because every game you play we promise to hook you up with Abdul from India who get 300+ ping and a kid name yourmom69 who is absolute dog at the game. I've been stuck in gold for about two months because my teamates game after game drag me down ranks. The only reasonable gamemode is 1v1 because you cant get teamates you get opponents. Fix the ranking system and fix the players.
0;The emense mm is teaming you up with salty noobs all the time. Its very frustrating. If you have played dota2 and know ITS matchmaking it is very similar to this. If you want to ease yourself from the pain that this game puts on you don't buy. Very buggy/laggy ball which makes it impossible to predict where the ball is going to hit.
0;Plays a lot like the game should be a free game. Physics are really wacky in the game but I guess if you want a game with rocket cars playing soccer you aren't looking for a realistic game. However not worth the $20 for such a minimal game. Servers could also be better.
0;if you want a rage worthy piece of that bails out the players then this is the garbage for you it takes out the fun of the game for higher ranks when it makes sure you cant beat a rookie or someone lower level then you ive played alot of hours but its just to rage worthy for anyone that thinks that they will win if they play a rookie or semi pro im a vet and division rank prospect but i kill every game with 6+ goals and still ranked low this game shouldnt get the hype it has such t...
0;Matchmaking and ranking system are in need of a major overhaul. Basically if you don't have friends to play and chat with expect it to be a role of the dice whether you get good teammates or not. If you can't carry crappy players you lose. Oh and it doesn't matter if you are amazingly good if you'd don't win the match you don't rank up. Makes no sense. Would not recommend until they fix this.
0;this stupid ing game.. it was HARD ENOUGH TO RANK UP WHEN IT WAS BY POINTS BUT NOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO GOING UP IN A DIVISION AND EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN DIVISON ING FIVE YOU CAN WIN 6 GAMES AND NOT GO UP A DIVISION AND THEN LOSE ONE ING GAME AND GO BACK DOWN. COOL. LOVE IT. YOU.
0;"""Product received for free. Probably by far one of the worst racing games i've ever played. The Maps range from a square to a square. Every map has a stupid ball that keeps getting in the way. Almost no one actually races and uses exploits to boost and fly around the map. Everyone spams """"calculated"""" and """"N*gger"""" in the chat. Forces me to buy keys just to open a crate and get faster cars. Fast and furious car has big hole in the back of it???"""
0;Since the last update me and my friend were unable to play together on raked due to him owning rocket league as a shared game!!! FIX THIS SO PEOPLE CAN HAVE FUN AGAIN!!! IT IS RUBBISH THAT ME AND MY FRIEND CANNOT PLAY COMPETITIVE TOGETHER! FIX IT OR IM RATING IT DOW
0;After 156 hours of game here is my conclusions...Pro's 1)May be fun sometime... (that's it)Cons 1) Matchmaking with no logic at all (I'm veterant and playing with rocketeer)2) Ping at Dropshot mode at evening when all other modes are ok (wtf?)3) Lots of non senseable hits...Play it only if you really bored and nothing to do at all......Or simply save your money/Buy FIFA 17.
0;It's a great game sure but many thing will make you hate it as for lag and servers issues. The community too is sooo bad try 1v1 you will have at least one guy saying you suck all the game it can be quite fun D.Play it with friends or just dont because alone it can be just sad.
0;its a fun game overall however i got hacked today they had proof of a one sided trade and who did it and even with all this they wont reverse the trade and give items i earned back so i give them a down vote there is no reason to let them keep the items and not set things straight
0;this toyko update is complet the game was fun and simplitic but now they are trying to make it more complex and thats not why i play rocket league i play rocket league for the 5min of simplistic fun if i want complex i will go play Dota 2. would like a refund to be honest if 1/3 the time i get a map then 1/3 time i dont even play the game.
0;I was really getting into this game but then after an update a couple weeks back it became unplayable. Despite having a ping of around 30 myself and a friend get constant freezes and disconnects. At first i presumed they had stuffed something up and would quickly fix it but nope.. still no change and im starting to give up on it.
0;Up against 2 PC players but you're with a playstation user. You might as well leave the match because it's 1v3.Rate this game 10/10 because play station users ruin the game they ing suck. They ram into you they mess up your goal shots they shoot the ball into your own goal/ect.
0;"""This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Ever hit a ball so hard it moves backwards? Now you can. In this game the physics are F****D. The driving and car styles are absolutley horendous. There like some kind of Tonka toy a kid would play with. Save yourself $20 and go buy an 8th of weed and enjoy life without this so called """"game""""."""
0;I hate this game with a passion on the top ten things I have wasted money on in my life this is on that list right below a lottery ticket. Its not the graphics or anything about the game except the human element within this game sucks. If I could get a refund I would delete this hot mess out of my life.
0;"""Got scammed for skins I dont even care about through steam chat through one of my """"friends"""" who got """"hacked"""".As soon as you get any super rare item in the game you are going to get spammed with scams from all angles because Psyonix makes your item library accessible to third partys without your permission so the scammers know when to hit you hard.People beware of a site called rocketleagueX it is a total scam."""
0;Game is the shitest pile of crap with full on V neck sweaty cucks who have dorito's sitting on their router and can't even bend over to reach their toes. People that sweat out and get pit stains in this game make me sick. The best bit is when you intentionally get blown up by the crappy s who would be better off ended KYS SMH.
0;I hardly play and still own diamond 3's like nothing so this is credible. The physics engine is horribly inaccurate and latency even with distributed servers is a mess. Additionally these developers allow for hardcore racism to be slandered in game. Don't subject your children to this.
0;off this game legitimately can suck my dads fat ing I have spent a total of 200 hours on this ing piece of and i dont really know why. I honestly would rather throw my is to a ing blender. Like seriously off rocket league. you and your ing developers can ing commit this game is a waste of time breath space hours money es loyalty. I could create a better ing game off the back of my dads ing smegma. YOU S
0;literally the worst game I've ever played. Let me edit this real quick. Literal ing garbage. No way to add friends no remediation for ranked game leaves quite possibly the worst ing match system available... it is punitive and broken. Unplayable mess of complete and utter t. Do not buy. DO NOT BUY
0;Fun game and all but if your game times me out why the should I get 15 minute penalty? Wasting my time making me not wanting to play this game over stupid The game even shows me an error code when I get kicked? Is that my fault? No its the game's fault and the game's server. Fix it
0;"""are you tired of hackers in CS? are you tired of VACs false promises? Do you think this game is going to be different? It is a good game but hackers are so heavy just play the game and say """" why do you have a VAC ban?"""" and 2 3 people will respond with why they hack but in their minds its ok so if you like HVAC or HACK games this is a great. pre hacker 8.1 post hack 3 less then h1hacz"""
0;Please stop with all the DLC you are ruining the game. At least include the new stuff if you have to make new cars... its annoying to have to pay to have all types of paints and .. i mean come on i paid 20 ing dollars for this small car soccer game at least give me what i ing paid for... i hate dlc...
0;I have a 6 core processor and GTX 970 well over the recommended requirements of this game. It is choppy randomly lags because they use trash servers single player mode is a joke and pointless all while they lure ppl in with hats or prizes that don't mean a thing. DO not buy this game.
0;Please ing help me I have a desktop that crashes sometimes but quickly restarts. But when I get back to rocket league I often get a time out from match making because it thinks I left on purpose most times I do not even get the oppertunity to re connect. Which obviously is horse Thank ing god in advance but surely you can ing fix this. Especially the incrementally larger time outs.
0;F*ck this Game. In 2 days playing i get like 1 time Wasteland Map and 2 times Tokio Map. So when they handle that like this my thumbs down will stay.Edit Thanks developer for ruin the game by listening to the kiddie community and thank your for the last update every second game laggs.
0;As a player from Western Australia the lag makes it really frustrating to play at higher levels. The slight lag is enough to make you miss an occasional shot and this is a pretty big f*king deal when you are playing with other really skilled players. NEED SERVERS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA!!
0;"""I played this game about 200h and i realised that my life is worst than it was. i should be rising star or higher but everywhere is a hacker in every in' game. just dont buy it. EVERYWHERE HACKERS AND IN' KIDS. Not recommended at all. """"Rage League"""" 19.99$"""
0;ing gambling worst game ever created it requieres so much precision that you will loose always at least 7 of your 10 games played a day or 3 of 5 games a day.the 1 vs 1 is even worse as the only factor that mades you win is Luck doesnt matter how good you are at this game.This game has very poor physics. Making you loose most of your games.
0;honestly liked at it first. until I realized the most dumb care into a game I ever seen. Getitng matched with people 3 times my rank and my team has all rookies and semi pros? gimme a break man...plus the AI in season mode is the worst I ever seen. Not impressed
0;I leave one game because my teammates...well...did not know which is the right goal. Nevermind. RL JUST LET ME LEAVE THIS ING ROUND. I dont...i repeat.... I DONT want to join the same round 7 times in a row again...remember i left this round. I LEFT! What is this for a systems which gave me the same round which i left over and over again.....???? We have 20 k player in the playlist and i find the ing same round 7 time in a row? Im Out have to drink some whiskey to calm down.
0;This game is so bad i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself also un installed 44 ping but game keeps skipping not my graphics card or anything.
0;Rocket League AKA. Cars 'n Balls Football Cars Top Gear Car Football simulator. Would rate 9.8/10 but to be a 10 would require the game to include a Tuk Tuk DLC in the future. Therefore I do no reccommend this game and will only change my reccomendation when a Tuk Tuk DLC is added so I can follow me dreams of becoming a professional Tuk Tuk Footbal driver and make my father proud so he stop beating me savagely with a coconut every night.
0;Okay so i played this game for 100hr+ without any problems using my ps3 controller. Then i came back today to play a couple of rounds but now my ps3 controller is only playable as player 2...WTF!?! Now i can t play the game until it is fixed. (Note I have uninstall and install the game to see if it works and uninstalled and installed the ps3 controller drivers. Nothing Works)
0;Matchmaking is terrible. You regularly get 20ms ping players paired with 200 800ms players while the game is unplayable above 100ms ping. This happens in competitive 1v1 as well.I don't recommend this game.Update since season 4 matchmaking is super slow. Expect 5 minutes between games instead of 30 seconds.Update ... and a rank reset again. Every season (say every 2 months) you have to earn your rank again and end up terribly matched for about 50 games.
0;This game is cancer. Servers are so poorly maintained it made my mother divorce my father and made my dad kill himself. The auto ban system made Donald Trump win the Presidency. This game gives loser bubbles to all the kids giving them Bull hits like Bernie Sanders giving away free I get no bubble and my car misses the ball and the boost by 1mm and i slit my wrists a little deeper. This game is why ISIS hates America. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. Me 0/10 10/10 IGN
0;There is absoluitely shocking amounts of server lag if you are thinking of buying this game do not... at least until they sort it out.My ping is 26 (easily low enough) and my car slides all over the place with the disconnect symbol appearing. TL DR DO NOT BUY until they sort the servers out.
0;I'm Writing This Review Again Rocket League Ok.... This Game Was Fun When i bought it like 4 months ago But Now They JustDid Something With Middle East Region and Now The Game is Not That Much Fun As it Used to beI play on Eu Now Cuz its Less Laggy Than Middle East 6.5/10 Just Because Game Have good psyics and i can score some good shots in freeplay Competetive Match Making Is Rigged Literally Rigged Why Do i have to play with someone who is Diamond 2 ? and im plat 3? I dont understand
0;"""Sometimes I wonder if some have the option """"disable skip"""". This frustrate me alot and put me on a tilt making me lose games and sometimes I swear and get really angry. I have killed my dog and my wife has left me. Don't buy this game unless you can handle a game with nonskipping dorks. Loads of germans aswell learn english maybe"""
0;I dont understand this game. Everyone plays 10 placements and get down bottom to prospect 1. So why have placements when you start from bottom anyway?I just hate that i must now wait couple weeks to get nice balanced matches. Its not even funny to have newbies and legends in same match!Its in the sale you can buy it now but dont waste your time on now. Do something funnier for couple weeks...
0;"""This game did not have The Bahamian flag. It has The Jamaican Flag but no Bahamian flag. The Bahamas is richer and more stable than Jamaica why must games spit in the face of my country?This and the fact that steam region locks me with a bunch of spanish speakers when everyone in the country speaks english... war is the only option. Once I get my flag / We win the war this will be changed into a """"yes"""" reccomendation."""
0;After so much time spent in this game i can say for sure.Don't play this gameYou can be the best player you can do everything right you can just follow the basics your team will crush your hopes and dreams when you try to achieve something cool.And they allow semi pros and lower ranks to join ranked games ing absurd
0;Ehhhhh.... really fun game to start. Lots of bugs and plauged by lag spikes. Sweet first week of play but then worthless. Buy and try. Then quit.*Edit* Bugs are fixed i guess. Lag still ruins games. 1v1 is depressing for that reason. Rubberbanding is just depressing. Can be fun with friends but they haven't fixed multiplayer across platforms either.
0;this game is great but keys and crates why. who want that i love this game and fun for love but keys come on there are other ways of make this game great. like have about custom falg option lol guys new csgo lotto this is not waht the game is about and wach this hurt the game ( sad day sad day so no if you are new i do not recommend this game under $20 wach the youtube for all that i think Lightningmaloy i am going to cry in the csgo room (
0;Pro really good game with a lot fun VS Con Crossplaying with ps4 sucks and disabling the option doesn't do Also double jumping high in the air is and I don't how the people do it after being in the air for so long. this game now until they fix both of them.
0;Servers are laggy especially when in Competitive. Not to mention the fail competitive system. When someone leaves in the first 10 seconds (or even later) the game is not cancelled or you don't get a bot to help out. If you like frustration this is the game you want
0;If u join a game it is some time a crap round u cant even win 0 8 and the balancing also doesnt work so well.A good ping is very import if something other than the game happens on the home net work a get a latency over 300The new Maps are crappy as hell. Few people like them and on the aqua map u get a hell of a frame drop.Game engine puts u into games already lost with some seconds left to play or already over. With every update it got worse.
0;You pay 19.99 and every two months or so they come out with new DLC. but of course you have to pay 5 dollars every time and they rarely come out with anything for everyone to not have to pay. the game is okay other than that its just annoying that you're given anything for supporting the game in the first place.
0;Nice ING game you ing SPERGLORD HIT. Holy it pisses me off when some unoriginal assholish dickweed decides it would just be ING HILARIOUS to make the SAME. OVERUSED. GAME. What do you even ing hope to gain out of this? Karma? Well you're certainly getting that cause it seems like a lot of other inbred ing autistic are thinking you're just ING HILARIOUS and that this GAME HASN'T BEEN MADE A BILLION ING TIMES. you.
0;This game is trash dont get it. Everyone gets super lucky and gets the best bounces against us. Gibbs ur garbage at this game. This game matches you up against pros when you are about to get promoted or season reqards. Pay2win keys give you items that make ur car faster. Mantis is the only good car. I heard Psyonix the developers miss the North Atlantic Slave Trade. RIP. Buy a good game like Knack 2 or Sonic Forces. You can make ur own sanic in that game rocket league has no sanic RIP.
0;Probably the worst game I have ever played. Its fun at first but once you get use to the controls you realize the game is jsut 110% luck that's all it is. Anyone who says different is delusional. Community is garbage like most it's full of obnoxious cretins who'll just spam the chat with insults.
0;"""The barrier of entry for this game is a IQ that rivals that of human potatoes. If you pass this simple task you're on your way to becoming the next pro level Rocket League player. Get ready for """"fun"""" bounces that will have both you and your opponent asking yourselves """"Why am I playing this horrible excuse for a game?"""""""
0;Okay Yes it's fun. Nothing to say about that.But please when you charge 20 Euros for a game please have servers ready. If you have more than 45 MS the game is unplayable. Moreover on game out of 3 the server lags like crazy (i.e. you see things teleport).Good idea. Terribly executed. Do NOT buy !
0;"""Gameplay is smooth and addictive better with friends might I add but there is something lying beneath. Devs have released an """"update"""" oh wait I'm sorry the update is $3.99 my mistake. Greedy developers... I paid for the game once already why should I have to pay MORE on top of that for a release that should be free and as an update. You have a great game here and I see alot of potential but don't go down this road."""
0;I HATE THIS GAME. ITS NOT WORTH THE $22 CRAP GAME. NEEDS BETTER GRAPHICS AND MORE CARS. THE CRATE SYSTEM IS CRAP. THERE SO POOR THAT THEY NEED TO BRING CRATES INTO THE GAME. LMFAO ROCKET LEAGUE. THERES SO MANY PEOPLE WHO PAYED $22 FOR THIS GAME AND YOU STILL NEED MORE MONEY. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS GAME AT ALL.
0;Very bad physics game. Physics are made up and aren't real life applicable. There is no accel due to gravity. It's a set fall speed. It makes timing impossible unless you put time into this game and disregard all real life physics. THE GAME ING SUCKS BECAUSE IT MAKES UP RULES. this game. I hope the developers go broke and the pro scene dies.
0;Ihave 1.8k hours in this game and im boring of toxic and bad players full community of scammers bugs in the game servers...Dont buy this game if you want to play something fun go on PUBG(but now is full of cheaters) Fortnite(good for all players and very fun) Poe(very solid and fun game) and some others.DONT BUY THIS GAME you can do better things with 20$
0;The game is amazing dont get me wrong i love this game but i would not recommend this game as long the servers are still ed!.You can play a game where you think you are going for the ball but suddenly the game lags and you get teleported back.So this game is good but do not buy it untill they fixed the servers
0;this stupid game can't let u play a game with a local PC just like warcraft 3 i can't imagine how the devoleper didn't thought of that simple idea we always have to play online all the time and can't play Co op advinture mode on splitscreen in the same PC stupid game i don't recommand this stupid.
0;Do you like playing solo and want proper matchmaking? Steer far away from this title matchmaking constantly places you to lost matches or solo against teams of 3.Ranked is a joke as both team queue and solo queue are on same queue and penalties for leaving are minimal. (15 minutes before you can rejoin and no ranking loss)Until they fix matchmaking issues I cannot recommend this game for solo players.
0;Online server's haven't worked since launch. No signs of these issues being fixed. Sick of devs releasing games that don't work properly. Simple open beta to test the server load before launch could of easily forseen and help prevent this problem.The game itself isn't terrible but without online play kind of defeats the object of playing for me.
0;Game is Each patch breaks something different. Lag Hits Ghost Hits Demos not working Car physics on ground not consistent. Updates break ball &amp car physics (sometimes before major events) Servers still run poorly especially after major patches Updates mostly revolve around crates/keys
0;I love this game and the only reason I dislike it is because the server connections are absolute for me. I got a 100mbps download and 40mbps upload speed with a ping to the WEST COAST from North Carolina being only 67 but god forbid I join a game on the EAST COAST servers because then I get 100+ ping. Fix your
0;Just like every other promising company the moment they smelled money their aproach towards the updates are totally money milking based. Servers became malfunctioning and they don't care yet they force you to play with the Premium Pass system that is basically ripped off of Fortnite. Once again greedy human nature triumphs. Don't buy this game. The fun aspect of the game is completely gone as the game pushes you to care more about useless cosmetics than the actual gameplay.
0;Well after 200+ hours in this game I can sayEvents GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND!Level GRIND GRIND GRIND !Drops GRIND GRIND GRIND GRIND!Rank Win 1 game get 1 divizion 1 lose 1 game lose 2 divisionsTraders Most peoples I ever met buy things for 5$ sell it for 10$Fun Only if you play with friendsIn the end SALT SALT SALT SALT SALT and full of cringe kids who say ez at the end even if they loseIf you're looking for a game where you want to grind more then in world of warcraft you found it.
0;Every single time I think about playing this garbage I got trolled flamed own goaled by my team mates and left alone vs 2 other players.This game is a joke and the devs only concern is money. And if you want to play this garbage avoid playing alone by all costs or else you'll have a stroke.
0;"""Horrible game studio in charge of this game. Psyonix's only priority is to make more money from loot boxes. Servers are usually laggy and buggy (rubberbanding teleporting). The """"Competitive"""" Matchmaking system is completely broken from all the boosted players at every rank. Majority of competitive games have toxic players or toxic teams."""
0;1v1's are just cheap and ing cancer tactics.2v2's are just 2 friends matching against one equal skilled oponent and a ing .3v3's are just cluster s untill you are very skilled and only playing with friends.its pay to win with the dlc and realy ing repetetive. was better before tho.
0;This was a really fun casual game. I'm not a gamer I play games for fun in my spare time after work or in between projects. However ever since season 9 when they decided to bring competitive to hockey it's been nothing but stress. No longer can you find a fun group and endless queue you're forced into new opponents each time. They've ruined a game I had spent 300+ hours in.
0;Game crashes affecting my rank is BS. The game should be able to tell when the it crashes as opposed to when a player is quitting out and not penalize the competitive ranks. I was gold level and with a single crash i got shipped to lower silver divisions. Ugh.
0;if you only play this with people who you know its the best game to play but the community with this game is one of the worst out there. every person you meet in game will swear at you and just overall be rude to you in any way they can think of and the ranking system doesnt help by placing you against people multiple ranks above you consistiently and those people rudely refering to you as any number of explicit names. Would not recomend for anyone without 5 friends to play it with at once
0;"""Customer support sucks big time (They always seems uninterested and try to blame everything on you). The servers also suck (packet loss high ping disconnections). The community sucks toxic and microphone spam without the possibility of report or the customer support doing anything. Season pass? Loot boxes? Really? Greedy Psyonix what not... No crossplay and sh*** PS4 crossplay? Just have """"patience""""...But the game is pretty fun. 5/10"""
0;1v1s gave me cancer...Literally 98% ing luck.Game is only fun if you play it for a laugh for about an hour and then uninstall.Trying to learn this game seriously is like trying to fit a spoon into a USB port Probably doable but ing pointless and filled with ING USELESS LUCKY ..10/10 would get outlucked out again.
0;Bad servers several bugs weird ranking system you lose points when the server disconnects (nothing you can do about it). Game is 70% based on luckFun to play for half a hour a day when you play longer than this amount you will start to become aggresive and break your shoe.GG
0;Ask yourself why do you play video games? My answer is to have fun. This game is fun at first but is no longer fun. It is extremely toxic. 95% of the time I play this game now I end my session very very unhappy. Therefore I don't/can't recommend this game.
0;I love this game I wish I could still play it. It stopped launching months ago after trying every single thing I can possibly find on google to remedy the issue aside from reformatting my computer which isn't happening. I know I'm not the only one who faces this issue and I find that to be pretty ridiculous and ultimately I can't recommend the game to anyone now because of that.
0;New update? You mean new downgrade.. Nice job psyonix online is unplayable since i get stutter every seconde and lagspikes every 10 secondes. Not only me but at least 80% i play with get it to. Stop focusing on cosmetics and money and fix your goddamn game first
0;It's a good game the problem is...Psyonix. These devs made a great game and they now care more about crapping out new skins and re skins of maps for money than fixing the trash servers and the trash camera and the other bugs surrounding the game. The only way I'd give this game a thumbs up is if these devs are releaved of control which they should be because they are stooping to the level of gold digging .
0;game concept is good but after 1020 hours there's still so many people that just don't seem to have a brain like at all. It's as if they don't understand basic physics. If i hit ball here ball will go here. That kind of thought process doesn't exist. So for the base game as a bit of fun to drive a rocket car into a ball it's great as a team game stay away if your IQ is over 40 mines 41 and I still cant stand these people anymore. I finally snapped morons inhabit this game now shame.
0;"""Edit This game is now.repetitive boring and full of 12 year old kids that false report you.I got banned by a 10 year old (no joke.) for saying his username in chat.Guess what his username was..."""" digger dagger fagger""""and HE reported ME for saying his username in chat.I got banned for 72 hours straight. thats 3 days.I'm not going to flip off Psyonix just yet. I'm kindly asking for them to remove my 72 hour ban because of this childish reason."""
0;Great game overall but the constant crashing interface bugs and not being able to play with a ping less than 150 makes it not worth the price.Edit Everything appears to have been fixed!Edit 2 Servers are utter garbage PSYONIX seems to always choose the cheapest servers available.
0;Matchmaking is horrible if you're in the heartland. 33% of games it will give you a &lt 50 ping server. 33% of games it will give a 80 90ms server. And for the final 33% it gives you 120 140ms servers. Consequently you will loose 1/3rd of your games no fault of your own and be stuck in the gold class.
0;"""The game is great BUT Wintrades (hate this one) Kidz Trolls Elitist (those who are gold and they believe that are god and dont want to """"carry you"""") AFKers. TOXIC community (You can even talk to your teammate cuz he will answer you with all kind of stupid things) Ppl who dont even know how to play play Rank Games mixing good players with horrible ones. Loot boxes"""
0;very bad game packet loss very bad profile menu. not made for all people is very bad polishedon and very good internet super PC and the game still has packet loss lag the other games that has high demands works great but this simple game has to be played on NASA
0;"""Good Game semi crap community. lot of trolls ruining/preventing games (forfitting at start).as for IN GAME trades (the 5 """"matching quality"""" one) the matching quality part is INACCURATE. Each rare+ item belongs to a certain """"series"""" and aparently you cant trade between em. i currently have 20 rares and 15 super rares that i cant trade BECAUSE of this. FIX OR CHANGE AND EXPLAIN MORE CLEARLY!!"""
0;Horrible matchmaking.In standard there's basically 0 matchmaking. I have 0 interest in competitive. I started playing over the free weekend got hooked and immediately bought the game. Wasted $10. The horrid matchmaking (or lack thereof) really ruin an otherwise extremely fun and addicting game. I am a complete noob and am constantly being matched against Veterans Experts who can pull of aerials reliably and most games are complete blowouts.Fix the matchmaking Psyonix
0;+ Great game overall+ Lots of fun especially with friends+ Support for low end machines+ You can turn off the chat Server problems that are growing with each update / month Insanely toxic playerbase ( but you can turn off the chat and not care ) Loot crates that you can open only with real money (excluding rare events for free keys)
0;I have had a lot of fun playing this game overall but I just found out that the ranking system intentonally creates win/loss streaks by pairing you up with other players who are either trending up or down. This seems very dishonest to me and I regret the importance I placed on percieved perfomance in ranked matches.
0;Massively overrated majority bad mannered community and developers who want more money so they introduce gambling for kids CSGOgambling.and the amount of times I've joined a match only to see the scoreboard is ridiculous. I doubt the devs even care how they are.
0;i have recently stop enjoying this game i dont know if it just my luck or others have the same problem climing the ranks i cant seem to gain anything or enjoy it as i have at least one person that sit and give verbal abuse or i have people that just want to stop their team winning.
0;Love this game. Although the servers are really starting to change my mind. I swear I can't go more than 4 5 games without lagging to the point where I have to just quit. My internet is fine. My ping is around 30 40. I really do enjoy spending time on RL but if this continues I'm going to have to say goodbye. (
0;This is a fun game and it kept me entertained for about 2 months after that I lost interest. The hype around this game has gone. I tried coming back but I am not as good anymore. This game requires consistency playing regularly is key. To be honest I am 50/50 on this game it s fun but lost its charm.
0;this games you more over than any other game is just random crashes when you are playing ranked does not let you rejoin the game cause it says no reservation found and then gives you a ban it's realy nice that they update it and then is starts crashing for a lot of people and still don't fix it so ty for my ban + you wan to get spam from replays that i would recomend this game 12/10 it's spams you even after you want to leave a game or you are roasting the other team sike you saved a replay
0;"""Incredibly frustrating to the point of wanting to break stuff it rewards a very """"sit back and wait"""" mentality akin to Chelsea parking the bus. Also the lag gifts so many goals to players it's quite frankly tragic. It was fun to begin with but now everyone is aware of arse tatics (such as ramming or just waiting at the goaline constantly) it makes for nothing but a sore head and a cloud of curse words."""
0;this is a game that commends luck and ignores skill at all but the top .5% of play hitting the ball ends up just being an rng determination and physics seem to be made up on the spot its completly inconsistent with how hits affect the ball the game should be good but every time i go reinstall the game to give it another shot im instantly reminded that unless i spent 3000 hours on the game my input into it means nothing!
0;This game was loads of fun when it came out as surprisingly there were little no no issues with the lag. Now the game is how many months old and the connection is garbage. I can't believe they're still updating this game with the connection the way it is. Legit garbage. 2/10 congrats on being trash
0;Hello community.I totally do not recommend playing this game because it is full of toxic little and boosted kids and at the end of the day you will end up with a 24h ban for putting a kid in his place so yea this game idk i totally do not recommend it
0;"""I dislike this game because of toxic players who purposely you off and then when you say anything back YOU get banned. Unfair and horrible monitoring of """"reports"""". It's way too easy to get banned in this game from any snowflake that can't take what they dish out."""
0;A great game however the report system is broken. I am a defensive person when someone is toxic i am generally toxic back if nothing was said and they make a mistake i wont say anything because I realize everyone makes mistakes however I Somehow have ended up being 24 hour banned without warning. thats fine and dandy the people have spoken but ban timer doesnt start until your next login....
0;This use to be crazy fun! BUT they have changed the whole feel of the game. It includes micro transations now and the free drops are very few and far between. I would change down to 79/100 now. I dont like the changes and have lost interest as a result.
0;psyonix is a ing awful developer who is run by sensitive ing who ban you for a week for calling someone an idiot i bet theyre all ing scrawny insecure virgins who havnt dipped their in anything other than an 3 year old unwashed fleshlight their calls home
0;"""DO NOT BUYThe game is released since 2 month now and already selled a DLC but the server have not yet been fixed! Its basically impossible to play.In the start they claimed the problems resulted from the big amount of players but it remains still. You can not play a game without massive server lag """"rubberbanding"""" teleporting of you and the ball to random places on the map..."""
0;Purchased this game for a Mac soley because steam shows it has full steam controller support. There is no steam controller support whatsoever as of 12/12/16. Do some research and check out the forums nobody has a functioning controller with this game anymore. Buyer beware or hope for a fix.
0;This game has wayy to many lagspikes and glitches up its sleeve as well as campers farmers and just smurfing as well as laghackers that set someones ping to 1000 in order to be kicked.only upside the look.whoever the devs are.just no.get it fixed.after all these spikes exist since i ing bought it and my other friends have that too.edit still no performance changes nor any hitbox improvisations
0;used to be good everyone is just sour and horrible now im pretty good but if we lose my team mate just berates me and i just cant be bothered anymore. 9 times out of 10 i have the better score too but im just sick of the ammount of toxicity now . just get reported if we lose like WTF dude chill if i could get a refund i would
0;Wasn't actually banned or anything but absolutely despise Psyonix for implementing an automated permanent ban system for simply using bad words. Instead of giving chat bans they simply ban you from the game without the ability to appeal. Also we don't own the game anymore the ? Everybody nowadays caters to crybabies and snowflakes.
0;Whilst this game and it's fundementals are awesome I cannot support this crate gambling they have introduced into the game now with DLC that you can only get in crates makes it even worse yes they are only cosmetic but kids get hooked on this and with no guarantee that they'll get the item their after they'll keep buying keys at $2 a pop until they do...This sort of microtransaction system is greedy and toxic you should be able to earn keys in game...
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Online gameplay is IMPOSSIBLE due to constant lagging. This problem has been going on ever since the game was released with no improvement. I am highly disappointed. I feel like I have been cheated. It could be an AMAZING game if Psyonix actually cared about the quality of the gameplay and fixed the thing.
0;Good game but matching system is really suck ! When you're matched up and you got into the game you saw the score 5 0 ! and you were on the 0 score team ! this is suck and who's gonna play that match ? it cause too many leaver ! of the game. Matching system is suck as !
0;Step 1 Buy gameStep 2 Play game for 2 years and have your grades suffer for itStep 3 Get so angry you uninstall Step 4 Reinstall because its the game your friends play the mostStep 5 Get bored of itStep 6 Wonder why you spent 2 years of your life on this game and bought it for a friendStep 7 Write a review that probably no one will readStep 8 Move on to a different gameTo be completely honest I would recommend this game but I just deranked from a ing win so gg psyonix you
0;Product received for free. Except fps drop problem w gtx 1070 gameplay is awesome. Cars playing football lol. The game is interesting and enjoyable you should buy this game. ing fps drop made me stop playing this game. Gpu doesnt go over 570 mhz so I cant get any good fps. It happens only in this game. So I can say that If you have an nvidia gpu pls dont buy this game
0;Rocket League has the worst servers ive ever seen in a game's multiplayer. With 500 hours I'm quitting. The servers just declined in quality from release. It's become unplayable at this point. With 50 ping and 60 fps constant my car will rubberband everywhere and the ball is completely unpredictable. ggwp
0;veteran level player last play last review. It's good concept for a game but it has a terrible community terrible matchmaking. skill levels and in game economy is way out of proportion. spent over 50 dollars on cars and keys yet the mk2 versions are so rare that its not even worth it. this game is no longer fun for me the developer is just selling out to companies that wants to produce ad dlc.
0;"""I recommend this game as """"No."""" I Just logged into Rocket League and what do you know. My level items rewards and RANKS have reset. Some of the items to name a few that i SPENT MONEY TO BUY KEYS WITH THAT ARE ALL GONE are Hexed Wild Cat Ears Reaper and much more."""
0;Everytime there's a new update for this game its seriously just more crates. This game has problems and the developers just refuse to address them. I'm uninstalling this game and I'll NEVER play it again. Hopefully they fix it for the other fans that had hope for this game but as for me I'm done. 0/10 would never recommend.
0;Need to balance out match making. I know playing against players that are better help you out a bit. But if you're trying to learn the game and you're teamed with semi pro players getting matched against Vet's and Master's is a bit ridiculous. I can't have fun with this game when I can barely have a balanced out skill level of teams.
0;Game is fun but match up in competitive suck hard ! And competitive points reward suck ! win 10 game in row dont up in rank ! lose one game lose 3 rank... ok wtf really I beat people with more elo and I get nothing but if they beat me I lose elo...... WOW just WOW
0;Game? 8/10E sport? 10/10 it's amazingPrice? 9/10Community? 2/10The game is really good but the community is one of the worst if not the worst trust me i've played league of legend for 5y now. If you don't give a f**k about everyone trash talking the game is for you!
0;No crossplatform online partying. You cannot invite your friends from PSNET and then queue online together.Otherwise wxcellent game. If you have a beeffy enough computer you can use 3 screens and 3 contollers to play 3 way teams online from a single tower and each person can have theri screen. 1/10 for not inclusing crossplatform partying.
0;I can't remember anymore how many times now South America servers suddenly stop working for days or weeks and Psyonix doesn't even give us a response. South America servers have been broken for months and Psyonix doesn't give a If you are from SA DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. They take at least 2 4 weeks to fix it since we are not enough people playing so they don't even pay attention to us or even give and estimated time on when they'll fix things. Psyonix you suck.
0;I Just Played A Game Of Competitive 3v3 And At The End We Won In Over Time 2 1 And At The Scoreboard Screen I Get Demoted For Winning A Game! F*CKING T That Was My Chance For Gold 2 Division 1 And Instead I Get Demoted To Gold 1 Division 3! FIX YOUR F*CKING GAME AND GIVE ME MY PROMOTION TO GOLD 2
0;Fun simple game. There rerally isn't anything to it yet a keep playing for hours.ban me becuse my isp droped my conection... ONE TIME are you kidding me there was nothing i could do and i never quit games. 500 hours in i still havent quit a ranked game and i get baned first offence. you gota be kidding me. goals that shouldnt be goals and some that should and are not. get it together for a game that has such a following now psyonix really cant get it together.. 
0;This game used to be great. Now the match making is crappy unbalanced (I'm either against people clearly better than me or against people much worse than me) and the servers suck. The community is also a toxic mess try to make any constructive suggestions and you get hounded by people who think with their rank rather than their brains.That's not to say the base gameplay isn't good however I can't say I enjoy playing it anymore.
0;Bought the game and i can say that i had good fun with it... untill the developers stopped caring about their sh*t... Server crashes... High ping on european server (tested on diferent networks).... So please... if you want to maintain a multiplayer game... at least get the multiplayer part right.
0;This game became bad once Psyonix added in crates. Now the game is basically a trading simulator filled with microtransactions. At least in the beginning the gameplay was fun and the graphics were great. Now the gameplay is boring and old and the graphics are decent at best.
0;servers suckedfixedthen it was a great gameseason 3 comes alonggets placed from challanger 2 to the silver one of this game just because 4 / 7 games played where with ppl still trying to figure out how to actully move the goddam carwich is quit frustrating.I had this match where I was going 1400 + and my teammate was going 0 .i did 1400% better then he did HOW IS THAT FAIR FIX IT.DONT LET NEWBS PLAY THE COMP IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSthe game was fun but i am quiting . bye
0;This game has the worst community in history worst than rust you get banned just about for saying anything to your competitors and Psyonix will not take any video evidence against hackers scammers exct. they will say to use the ingame report system that doesnt work. and then they willl ban you fro attepmting to ban a toxic I do not recommend
0;This game is very fun when the matchmaking is fair. Everything other than 1v1 is really unfair. You either get a really horrible guy on your team or you get a really good guy that handles the whole game by himself. I have also encountered many bugs and glitches in ranked. I think this is a fun chill game but i would not recommend playing competitive if you are going to play seriously.
0;Oh look it's another Bluehole developer. The game used to be good it's now full of micro transactions awfull servers and to top it off developers are now banning players based on reports alone without actually checking chat logs.YOU WILL BE BANNED FOR USING QUICK CHAT FUNCTIONS!! YOU WILL BE BANNED IF STREAMERS CRY!! After endless hours of playing this game this is the last straw for me i'm afraid. Time to uninstall what used to be my favourite game.
0;Changed from thumbs up to thumbs down which in all honestly should be a middle finger to the developers.Fun for a few matches but quickly gets frustrating in ranked since for some idiotic reason the developers decided to include arenas that differ a lot from the normal ones (Wasteland and Tokyo) where the bounces are way different.I guess internet never undersood real competition and why most sports are played with the exactly same arenas that are exactly the same.
0;I bought this game long ago and though it is very fun there's issues. I tried logging in for the first time in months. It has been updating in my library constantly and despite thought it faulted out This game has two things it needs to do play properly and have no bugs. It failes in this. If you want to play a fun game sure this is a great one if you can get it to download and play properly.
0;theres so much t for example if someone doesnt get connected to the game it just says reserved and then the match ends totally a waste of my ing time and this t ranking system demotes instantly after a loss and promotes after like 3 won games in a row. There is nothing new happening only new cases which is same different colour. Just cosmetics nothing else maybe a map redesign or a new map wow basically this game has been a waste of my 385 hours
0;"""Trash DLCs Psyonix_DevinGot banned for 1 day because I said """"kys"""" to a guy who was flaming me. The reason I got banned and he didn't is because he reported me and I didn't report him. Thanks Rocket League. On top of the recent lag on servers you add in this new crap. Might just stop playing RL again for a while. It seems that every couple of seasons they try to ruin the game with unneeded stuff. The crates are killing me too. TLDR the lads are slowly killing their game as they update it."""
0;After hours of playing I start getting error 71. This error prevents me from playing any matches because it freezes my computer and forces me to close the game. It is literally unplayable and there is no present solution for the error. These kinds of things should never happen especially in a game that costs money.
0;(so many hours...... for nothing) now if you are playing on keyboared you are ed because rocket league doesnt give any more sensetivity changes for keyboard....so if you have keyboard dont buy this gameand by the way the ranking system is too because now i am unranked after i didnt play rocket league for 1 day
0;This game is a game were it addicts you into openning crates paying more money for crates don't play this game its toxic community and they will ban you even if you go against the toxic people ing t game bans you from the game for being toxic can't even chat ban you they ban you from the game this game is to serious they need to fix its issues. Can't even make the game fun anymore no new modes except the trash new one that is so trash.
0;So I keep getting this message 'No servers online please try again later' when I try to search for a match in Rocket League. This happened since the last big update. Anyone knows a fix by any chance? Nothing seems to work and I am not able to play Rocket League anymore like this
0;"""Really dissapointed. Three times now that I get kicked out of a match and when I try to enter it says """"Connection timeout"""" and count as a ranked lost are you serious????? The three times we have been winning!!!!!!! Please fix this ASAP I support you guys and if this **** keeps happening I am going to quit playing this game."""
0;I love the very concept dynamics and customization of the game and its contents. Awesome graphics physics mechanics and gameplay. My only problem is thata person will have to spend a tonne of cash on decryptors items etc just to have their rides looking unique and decent. almost makes no sense at all. Points lost for that in my opinion.
0;Tbh I really enjoy this game especially with friends BUT in the server's current state it's virtually impossible to play online since you spend the majority of your time in a wall or stuck being slung around as the server tries to catch you up with its self. Wouldn't recommends anyone buy it until the servers are fixed.Actual game 7/10With server problems 1/10 (impossible to have fun)
0;It's an okay game but it's filled with arrogant people who smash people with coincidence so I think it's been sad to play it. People do not know that there is a Report system but nevertheless when you finally use it the Rocket League does not matter so people can just beat people in the game so others can get a worse play experience but beyond the nice gamei mean not smash but BOMB.
0;Started off a great game Lots of hours invested. However the recent update has ruined the game. Continual lag issues smurfing etc still apparent in the game despite the teams efforts.Major issues with server connection and i dont think i can return to this game until they solve these underlying issues.
0;This game is basically pinball. The presentation is good the servers are.... okay the balance of the game is fine it's a great game in those areas.Where this game falls down is the physics. Ball physics in particular is not very well done at all. Unfortunately physics is 90% of the game. I know why people like Rocket League it's short simple and easy to get into. Beyond that there is no depth to the game and it's really quite samey after a while.
0;its good for everybody who dont live in south east asia...the south east asiaa servers are horrible...they take bout 9 minutes just to find a match ....and half of the players dont connect to them....pysonix instead of fixing ur problems you are are just thinking of new ways to make money....introducing new crates...how many ing crates?....focus on fixing ur game ..especially south east asia side.......i used to love this game...i was obssesed with this...but now...i knida hate it....
0;The matchmaking is heavily rigged the ranking system is pure trash garbage and I have the heavy car / 1 second delay bug since 2 years and they will do nothing to help us (117 mega forum thread on their website with no response). 3500 hours and barely can compete with Diamonds noobs players. Psyonix is a very disgusting company and they don't deserve any of their success.
0;this game is alright as it is but there should not be a ban for saying bad words like wtf this game if im gonna be honest can be very rage indusing and if you're like me you will get mad and cus i got banned for cussing over voice comms so be careful what you say in game i guess and the creators of this game for making that a ban now i cant playEDIT Now it only chat bans you thank you Rocket League!
0;UPDATED REVIEW F%*K THIS GAMEThe matchmaking is a complete joke!It has this auto ban feature that even if you and your friends are playing you'll get banned for saying ANYTHING offensive to ANYONE!Not based on a player complaining just built into the system.I am done with crap like that cannot support it anymore!5/10
0;When you think you depend on your teammates in all FPS games then you come to Rocket League thinking that 3v3 you can do everything and see how actually useless players in your team are its unbelievable if you wanna play solo you are mad you will never be able to get past Platinum in 3v3 Solo 1v1 is great easily gone to Diamond but 3v3 you get players that literally started to play Rocket League 2 days ago Worst.Teamplay.Game.Ever. 0/10
0;This is a very fun game... WHEN IT WORKS. If you do not have the best computer I do not reccomend this game. When I try to play online or with my friends the lag makes the game in playable. I have had the game for a month it is has caused more agravation the fun.
0;"""Great game but you can get banned for benign trash talk (ie a simple """" you"""" after someone harasses you). Not sure if the bans are automatically generated based on reports or actually reviewed but it doesn't matter. Do not play online unless you are an extremely nice person"""
0;"""First of all I like this game very much its fun and cool to play. But this new """"progression"""" update is so buggy + servers are down and you can't play. I'm disappointed in this because i really like this game and everytime i want to play it says that servers are down. Not recommending until this game is fixed."""
0;This latest update/patch is absolutely horrible. Cars hitting the ball before they're even at the ball... frameloss and pings seem to be just randomly out of place and it's even creating 4v3 matches in 3v3... like what the hell.This game is pretty much dead to me right now until the next stupid overhaul. Nothing feels anything like it used to be all these months.
0;I used to enjoy this game. Fun time killer and when the season starts super competetive.However the community is toxic as hell. Further up the tiers you go the more salty people get. Almost no point in playing ranked unless you're playing with a friend because ultimately you'll end up with some who isn't actually playing for the joy of the game.
0;This game use to care about gameplay but now its just microtransaction and lobbies full of bugs. Really disappointed how this game has turned out. They use to say they will not be full of micro transaction but now thats all they are. Sucks to see a good game go to waste
0;"""The matchmaking is horrible it is actually a form of abuse. I had the game remove from my library because it has this power to put you in a """"one last game and this time I win"""" pattern. The grinding is so frustrating. Don't even think about ranking without a team. The developers don't never have and never will care about this."""
0;What a ing waste of time.Owned this game almost since release and they STILL haven't fixed the issues with rubberbanding.This game is literally unplayable unless you are a casual sucker. Get your ing together I can only recommend this game to you if you are under 12 / mentally challenged or both.
0;"""""""How many licks does it take to get to the center of this window?!"""" the average teammateHow can matchmaking be that ed up? From 1/4th the games not connecting a player to the ranking system being a joke you'd think the devs would take a break from releasing crates/hats to actually fix some problems."""
0;Game will ban you for no reason. Hands out 24 hour bans like candy apparently i dont even remember talking in general chat. Such a fragile society where you can get banned for 24 hours in a game for speaking in chat. Would highly advise to stay away from this game.
0;im done. after 25 loses i am done. maybe im not a good player but to lose 25 games is more the skills its the game. i enter every few days and lose first game. if its the team or if its something else but today was the last straw. i had a 51 percent wins and it dropped to 49.3. i wanted to love this game but i just cant.
0;get your sh*tty servers working with decent matchmaking. Sick of the constant bullsh*t with the damn rubberbanding matching with people 2 or three ranks higher than me and not going up divisions after 4 or 5 wins yet going down two divisions after 1 damn loss. Bloody hell.
0;Changed my review to negitive becuase the game has been crashing and instead of fixing the issue they give me a 5 min ban. I can not give a positive review on a game that refuses to let you play for issues out of your control. Their game crashes I get banned. No chance to re enter a match no way to submit what the issue is. Will NOT spend money on any more keys. Period.
0;I love this game! It's 100% skill based and really intense. Great! But and this is a big one your netcode for pc i S H ! T. It's been this way for as long as I can remeber no matter how stable and fast your connection is you from time to time experience slight time variation which can be devastating when ill timed.
0;The game's very fun at times but quite frustrating when it's broken. Basically everyone knows in this community the game's broken and badly coded. I'm D1 at the time of this review and everytime the game updates it breaks and most of the time they don't even fix it. Buy at your own risk.
0;This is t. Been waiting on cross platform all in year.... promised late july early august.... nothing.. THen the promis was late july early september.... still nothing... These developers don't know what they are doing. They are pouring themselves into a dying game that is fortnite.....
0;It's fun but it gets repetetive really quick. Also people using controller have advantage.There is Battle Pass microtransactions and lootboxes in a game that costs 20 already. That's a little bit too much for me. Also by now there are probably more types of lootboxes here than in CSGO.
0;"""I used to like the game but this game now is only trades farming hours and xp and then """"normal"""" players get ruined there scores because of master with 200 or even 100 hours pls dont farm train farming is not going to get u god at the game u will ruined for other peoples"""
0;This game makes money not only from selling the product itself but also from lootboxes and dlc. I'm not against it if that money is used to mantain the servers but that doesn't seem to be the case. Instead of fixing the damn servers they keep focusing in RLCS.
0;Game was sold to the Chinese government i deleted it from my profile and blocked all of their perms i granted watch out!!!!edit 12/12/18 game banned me for 10 minutes for leaving a game where the other team was afk and my team was scoring points on our own goal. This was my very first round back after several months.
0;It was a good game but now it just lacks in servers.. if you want a new game and you are thinking about RL.. you should rethink it... unless you see a headline of 10000 new servers for rocketleague... dont get it D if yesterday you could play RL with a normal ping.. doesnt mean that today its gonna be the same... peak hours in EU(not even peak) and magically my ping is 100+
0;"""""""Very interesting and highly addictive."""" &lt this was my initial review. but after years of torture i must say the game is excellent but i would not recommend it since the developers dont care about the bugs only about the boring new items and servers are the worst."""
0;UPDATE October 7th 2018.Icannot currently recommend this game because the servers are completely unreliable and the graphics are glitching. How about using some of that loot box money on providing stable servers?***Original reviewGreat game. It teaches you to be understanding and patient because there are no limits of stupidity that your random team mates won't break through.11/10 would scream at the screen again.
0;its okay i guessI said that that and then every match I've played in after I have lagged and lost most of them due to the inability to play the game. Servers are awful community is awful but at least you can buy a rocket pass that is just an obvious cash grab since it worked for Fortnite. Overall I'd rather eat rocks than play this game until the servers can hold a simple 1V1 game.
0;So first of all I have to say that I really love to play this game. When I saw it first i thought it looks pretty dumb but the moment I played it myself my mind changed on this game. However since they released the first Rocket Pass people have constant issues with the servers. I have to report like 1 in 2 servers because of issues. The bad stuff about this is the update was a few month ago so it seems they won't change anything about it so this game is kind of RIP
0;this game is the biggest waste of money i have ever in my life spent the devs punish you for defending yourself against toxic players in chat they give you no voice chat options all txt adn the amount of rage i get over matchmaking dont get me started this game is trash adn a ing money pit! i would rather go bankrupt funding EA than support this company that created this ing stupid game. the devs deserve to die for making a game this terrible there is absolutely no fun to be had!!!!
0;what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save! what a save!waste of time but fun idk. just lost so ... idk
0;The game is good I got a few DLC cars as well but the SA servers are SO BAD they disconnect all the time package loss lag interrupted matches. Can't even play a competitive match cause of the penalty regarding mid game disconnect. I'm not going to recommend this game until Psyonix or whoever it needs to be addresses these issues. The game is NOT enjoyable at this point due to lots of lag. The brazilian community is also extremely toxic as they will ever be.
0;Easy to learn hard to master. Great price for a game of this standard. You'll always find a game as there are many people playing all the time. Easy game to get 100% achievements in however you need to purchase a few dlcs. 10/10 game would recommend.Update If you want to play online the servers are terrible. Will change back to thumbs up when the servers are fixed.Update again Added more acheivements still easy to get. Servers are better than they were but still cause plenty of issues.
0;Played this game since beta and it was passable then. As an OC player I've either faced overly long matchmaking waits or moved to another server and had to deal with extreme latency. There is no sign that this game is going to get any better as it has slowly declined since release and has drained my will to play it.
0;ROCKET FIX THIS BUG WHEN I ENTER IN ROCKET LEAGUE I CAN'T PLAY WITH CONTROLLER BECAUSE IT SAYS PRESS START TO JOIN AND I JOIN WITH ME AND WHEN I PLAY A GAME MY MONITOR IS SHOWING 2 PARTS WHY? HOW I CAN DISABLE IT I WANT TO PLAY 1V1 WITH THE CONTROLLER BUT THE CONTROLLER DIDN'T WORK IF I DON'T JOIN IN THE LOBBY WITH ANOTHER ME FIX THIS PLEASE !
0;No Joke this game gets every season.when it first came out it was great not too many smurfs not toxic no griefing etc.. but like everything else on steam few seasons down the line and u got trolls in comp smurfs in every match and toxicity levels through the roof. USED to be a good game NOW its
0;If you want a game that has developers putting in 100x more effort into creating cosmetics for their lootboxes or crates as they call them than they do stabilizing the same broken servers they have had since launch then look no further. There is no game out there that can quite create the sudden rubberband like ball movement like Rocket League. No game has ever wowed me with how well it simulates your car going completely through the ball as if you never existed.
0;This game is here to extract as much money out of people as possible all the while having a nasty element within it's player base. You are teased by rare crates that usually only give you crappy decals for cars you dont use/own and rule breakers generally get no punishment. Other than these issue the game is pretty okay albiet with poorly performing servers.
0;It's such a shame that a great game like this is brought down by its developers greed.Sponsored DLC's are probably the only items you should buy in this game SHAME on Psyonix for putting new cars only in lootboxes.I sincerely hope that either the EU or the US will come with new legislation to stop this lootbox craze. I want to play a game not slot machines!
0;The trading IS AWFUL TERRIBLE DISGUSTING BAD!!!! If you want to trade with unknown players be aware that you GOING TO BE SCAMMED!!! HORRIBLE! It's the third time I got scammed BECAUSE the developers fought it's a good idea to make trades that are big and have more than 20 items to TAKE 2 TRADES!! WHAT THE F***! JUST FIX THE GOD DAMN S***! DON'T TRUST ANYBODY! BUT I'M AND DID THAT! &gt ( the game is great and I'm just salty )
0;Well complete update of review..Game itself is fine can't complain but players base is terrible.Every 2nd match I would get a teammate who is definitely younger than 15 years of age cries about anyuthing blames team throws game.. It becomes boring to play as game starts to feel awful and pointless.If devs would actually somehow start paying attention to reports instead of just banning some people for using swearing words that would be nice. But meh will keep it as a negative for now.
0;The rocket league servers cause immense lag eventhough my internet connection speed (3mb p/s upload) and my specs (16gb ram and 3.4 GHZ intel processor) are sufficient to play rocket league. This issue arrises as soon as I connect to the rocket league servers and it does also happen in single player mode. I don't know what causes the issue but a good internet connection and good computer specs are certainly not sufficient in order to play this game without any issues even in single player mode.
0;"""you start off with a car with some boost... and you play soccar with these machines... anyway games pretty fun when your playing (EZ) people but then you play those people that say """"EZ"""" once you hit that level cap when you play those people just delete the game its no longer fun LOL"""
0;"""The game itself is quite fun and would recommend if only it wasnt for the toxic community it has. Every other game if something is not going your team mates way youre being told they """" ed your mum"""" or to """"go myself."""" this even counts in non ranked where wins dont matter the childish behaviour of a large amount of players just sours the experience of the game"""
0;"""Its a good game but I would like it if the """"Searching playings around your skill"""" while you're finding a match actually ment that. I always get like veteran teammates and either legend or rocketter opponents. This makes my winning persentage 32.5%. Ive been playing for almost 2 years and Im only a expert. So I'd like that to be changed or atleast select what rank you would like to go agenst or just pick the same rank as you. Maybe even just... Idk... Find players around your skill.."""
0;After 2 years optimization still sucks and I started to think that developers doesn't give a fk anything about it much more than doing silly missions on survivor pass for this sht..Could you please stop being lazy fckin wake up and try to make something about it?
0;This game would be golden if you were unable to talk to the other team by default and I really just have the chat on cause I still have hopes of finding someone cool...but no.There is no respect no maturity no sportsmanship nothing!This game is just toxic as this community is toxic as the only thing people know how to do properly is trash talking each other.Basically Good Game Super Community (I guess if I went back to LoL I would find nicer folks nowadays)
0;Core game is amazing. Loot system is BS.Based on the way it's going new buyers would be better off waiting for it to go FtP since that looks like the direction the game is headed.Negative review is for crates as well as the dev's tendency to release updates that are buggy AF. Otherwise game is awesome.
0;It is a really great game! But there are a few problems...&gt cross platform play that makes you play with random console users (even switch)&gt lack of server upkeep so matches are lagging out more&gt ranked system doesn't match you with people of your own skill&gt loot boxes are a big thing
0;this game is terrible. the devs. the community. trash ranks that reward people with things they dont deserve everything between plat diamond is a how of ballchasers and carried gold trash who cant play the game effectively as a team. i literally hope the developers of this game die.
0;Fun game. for some reason my Xbox One controller won't work with (only this) game anymore. I tried re installing game/controller verifying game files. Nothing works. I have only ever used an Xbox controller with this game so not sure what's up. Downvote until fixed.
0;Fun but there are some problems. Need to force players to play the tutorial before playing against other humans. voice chat is implemented... but not much point since it works like garbage. servers get weird isses all the time. the afk issue (bots) is thankfully reduced
0;I will give it a No because this game isnt fun its just a competition you cant laugh with others since the voice chat is broken the matchmaking is pretty much a lot smurfs who say that they are not smurf they are just some guys that have 10 h in this game and became super good at it .
0;Stupid game made by a handicapped company. It feels exactly like a Hot Wheels game because its a copy of the Hot Wheels games. Don't buy it you spend 20$ for nothing. Its just a scam. Don't buy it. Don't look at the store page and if you do buy it refund immediately.I don't recommend this trash game made by useless peoples.This game is made by Brain Dead Inc. not PsyonixDon't even try to look at your steam wallet to buy when you are viewing the store page
0;Many thanks to Psyonix! I had an interrupted internet connection that forced me to minimize the game and re connect to the Internet. After doing this the message indicated that the match was over and the next attempt to enter the match received a 3 time ban in a row within 3 days for 24 hours due to accidental transfer of the cable from the Internet. Only regrets spending 412 hours in this game.Ps You have great servers in the game ... zero delays!
0;Match making is a ing joke. You will most likely get connected to the 0 4 match with 25sec left or even tho it has so ing massive playerbase you will play with/against bots. Recently they are more focused on adding hilarious pass thing than on fixing the game.Many updates later (including the one enabling the absolute cross play between every single platform) it still remains exactly the same.
0;WE NEED BETTER SERVERS IN THE EU!WE ARE PAYING FOR THIS GAME AND ARE CONSTANTLY PLAYING WITH &gt 150ms PING!GET YOUR $H1T TOGETHER!FFS.. I can't block any enemies cuz they're already 10 meters further away from me.UNACCEPTABLE!(5ms ping to other game servers. Psyonix fix this!)
0;"""Uhm..I never experienced so much stress and anger in my entire life like I did in this garbage """"game"""".This s from Psyonix are totally out of control and they killed this game.This game was fun to play before but after you see that they support the toxicity in this game by adding the +2 points for touching the ball once you start thinking """"This game it's wort buying?""""Answer No."""
0;Just to be clear I do enjoy the game and believe it is a great and refreshing idea. Just wasted 4 hours for the second time now to build a base and have vehicles just to lose everything because i fall through the map. Going to put this one back on the shelf and hope its better in a few months.
0;"""The game had plenty of potential. If they rolled back versions to when it was a decent game playable &amp fun I'd give it a thumbs up but it stinks now &amp only seems to reek more every time I play.Dev's aren't done ruining this title by a long shot. I'd suggest watch """"Let's play"""" and Twitch after the full release. Early access only promises to be more of the same worse than what it was before it got ruined."""
0;"""Please take the game back to 0.10.5.0 that was the last time I could play the game.I played 1426 hours up to 0.10.5.0 and spent 3 hours trying to get past """" LOADING SOLAR SYSTEM"""" on 1.0 and your game counted it as play time.Somebody owes me a refund and steam will not refund after 2 hours of p lay.If I am no longer able to play this game ( ASTRONEERS ) I will have to give it 22 million thumbs DOWN. AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO MY WORST ENEMY. thank you for your time"""
0;Single player is fun but online has been utterly ruined by hackers/modders. If you want to enjoy online....play console. There I said it. Gratz modders and hackers you have made the console version of this game better than PC. PC it is impossible to find a lobby without hackers and modders running around with god mode killing everyone taking away your guns crashing your game due to spawn limits. GTA online is total crap.
0;"""After more than 1000 hours 3 shark cards invested no mod or exploit used ever I was banned account reset everything lost no explanation given ticket closed by support """" banning decisions are final and may not be appealed""""Grand theft indeed of your time and money."""
0;Rockstar is banning players for playing the game without any cheat's or mods just banning for no absolute reason at all. My friend got a 30 day ban the other day with no reason attached just all stats reset and all money cars and properties gone. Do not buy this or any Rockstar game ever!

0;This game has been terrible since the very beginning.&gt Sharkcards&gt Grindfest&gt ONLINE content restricted from being in singleplayer&gt Any glitch involving money is patched out within a day but every other bug and exploit doesn't get patched out for months up to over a year&gt Empty promises
0;Take Two Interactive's shutdown GTA modding tool OpenIV..that's harsh!!! never played online and i never will. the only reason i buy this game is because of mods.they should embrace mods not remove them. i know its revenue in GTA5 online but seriously. the people paying additional money on GTA online are not the people that are gonna use OpenIV.
0;REVIEW PART 2 ELEKTRIK BOOGALOOSo Rockstar just went ultra shaddy on their Steam Summer Sale prices. Not only is it still $60 (With a nice little in game currency that isn't worth it at all) you cannot refund the game with this purchase. Why is that? The reason is that if you buy the game now which comes with that in game money you now can't refund your game. Don't buy the game during the summer sale if you're not sure that your PC can run it at a state you want it to.
0;Gta V used to be really fun though the latest updates have made online unplayable unless you already are rich due to the riddiculous imbalance and toxic community. If you want to even stand a chance at making any money people tell you to trick the server into thinking you're lagging to be in a solo session without greifers which ruins the point of multiplayer. Honestly they threw balance out the window in favor of pushing microtransactions the quintessential part of any modern game...
0;if i want to have this mutch work just to play a f*cking online game i rather download a pirate copy i can't play online is full of bugs sometimes i can't connect other times it kicks me out i dont kwon that to do when i was plaing a not original copy of this game i doesn't have this mutch work to play it i do not recomend
0;Product received for free. Cars in the latest update cost $60 each. If you want them all expect to spend upwards to $500.This game has turned into Grand Purchase Auto / Grind Theft Auto. They've totally ruined one of my favorite games on Steam. I'm done.Edit Looks like I've been permanently banned from GTA O despite never having modded let alone played the game in the past 3 months. Really R*?
0;After the insane ammount of money you have to spend to actually experience the updates well you do experience them by being destroyed by people with overpowered vehicles I didn't think I could be any more mad at Rockstar. But they somehow did it. I never thought they would be dumb enough to ban singleplayer mods.
0;Love this game but Take Two can go itself with restricting mod usage in SINGLEPLAYER. They don't even add new content to singleplayer. So much awesome content graces the lands of GTA Online but none of it reaches singleplayer and if you wanna spawn content from Online in singleplayer using mods you're ed now.
0;I played the game for 12 houers and got banned for no reason I would not recomend to buy this game if you dont want to get your money stolen+edit After talking to Rockstar suport via the phone they told me it is no chans theire banning system makes mistake and i will have to wait out the 30 days After waiting 2 days i now have gotten unban whitout any reason or information why.
0;So I've played around 400hourish on this game mostly online. Loved the game even when there were crazy updates. I never cheated if i needed money I bought shark cards. I've been playing PUBG recently and I came to play GTA again for the first time in 4months. On the login screen it said Rockstar took 9mil from me. Seriously? Not going to play GTA for a long time
0;142 hours on recordFOV MOD + SINGLEPLAYER Trainer + ReShade BANNice move Rockstar.I even preordered your 2013 game at a ridicule price to show you how much the PC relase was important but no let's screw the key selling point of our game to sell in game transactions to support the awful peer to peer laggy multiplayer that this game has.Let's wait until the 16th when my ban will expire to evaluate better the game
0;It's bad enough that there's so little extra put in to the pc release or that your full screen is glitchy. So people were nice enough to make an FOV fix for that and what happens? They get banned for having that mod installed. It feels poorly optimized for PC and it is honestly really depressing that you guys are doing so little to help the community and so much to ruin it as well.Please Rockstar change your policies and have the community make a great game even more amazing.
0;I won't be buying another Rockstar game ever. I bought this game for the ability to mod Singleplayer... And guess what? People are getting banned for playing SINGLEPLAYER using mods.There is various things a mod can help do.. Such as make movies and such and Rockstar is messing it up.
0;The only reason I'm playing this game at this point is because I got it for free from a friend. Every odd game I join has at least one hacker in it and the last one simply erased all the guns and ammunition in my possession. If I'd paid money for this I'd be down R*'s throat at this point.
0;Multiplayer is filled with hackers You can't do anything in Online because everything costs millions of dollars which you will only get if you buy sharkcards (keep in mind the game costs 60$ to begin with) Getting tons of errors upon loading into the Online version Loading time will take up to 7 8 minutes after that you will start to question if you will actually get into the server Boring world with not much to do other than small activities like tennis/golf etc.
0;On the behalf of OpenIV I can no longer recommend this game. Mods make GTA on the PC GTA. If Rockstar does not understand this than they really do not know how to conduct business. Sorry Rockstar your actions really made it clear that you are only in the game for profit not for the dedication of your customers.
0;I put a lot of time in this game and in the past I would have recommended it however there is too much grinding and everything is so damn expensive and you either grind for hours buy microtransaction shortcuts hack or just stop playing. I picked the latter option.Singleplayer is excellent though. If you want to play only for the singleplayer wait for the game to go on sale.
0;The modding is one of the most attractive ways to bring T2 more consumers. Now they received the consumers from openiv and totally abandon it. They are not appreciated about what the openiv have done in near a decade past. I recommend you not to play this game. Pogchamp and smiling face emote.
0;Once one of the most mod able games that could turn your game into a much more better game.Now it's one of the most jackshit games i have ever played since they removed modding do not recommend after they took action against Modding modding kept this game alive apart from using it in Multiplayer.From everything is possible to all is limited.
0;Rockstar and take 2 are bunkch of s to their community members. The only care about bottom line and gaming needs passion. Is GTA5 fun? Could be. But have you no principals and would send your money to such nazi company? Personally not even pirating their
0;Take Two R*'s publisher decided to Take Two fingers and show them to OpenIV and the entire modding community simply so that they can force people into GTA O and buy microtransactions. I've got 2 copies of GTAV PC retail and digital I've probably played 200 hours in game but due to Take Two's incompetence DO NOT BUY GTA VEdit OpenIV appears to be back but that doesn't change my verdict on Take Two and you still shouldn't support their shady practices.
0;Such a great game with lasting potential ruined by greedy corporate talking heads that have no idea why the game was so successful and the series so long lived and long loved.OpenIV was a great tool to keep the game alive long after the devs moved on to make the next great thing but now it's gone and noone should bother wasting money on the next cashgrab.
0;This game is the ultimate sandbox and opened up modding to a community of people who have loved it for many years. Recently Take Two shut down Open IV which is most of the mods for this game. We need to show Take Two that this is not right. This game is excellent but the company in charge is not respecting the community they built. This disrespect is frowned upon and I would not recomment this game.Sign this and maybe we will send a message.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;what about a better experience on the online version ??? nooooo let s stop the modding community and ban legit players and let the damn hackers roaming free .. company only cares about consoles we are the MOTHER ING PC MASTER RACE WE stand up for what it s right !!!!! and you rockstar
0;ive played over 200 hours of this game and the devs said they would always allow modding on the game. And now they've effectively eliminated modding so they can prop up their pay to win online 'game'. Get rekt take 2 and rockstar congrats on taking EA's crown
0;Take Two has taken it upon themselves to drive their game into the ground. Its going well so far.Also I've played over 600 hours of this game and I dont see why they felt the need to send out cease and decists to modders after all this time or even at all. Please fix.
0;I'd normally give it a positive review but I am sick and tired of being used as a cash cow. Microtransactions fine fair enough. But now offline modding tools are being taken away from us all while online continues to suffer from hackers that don't use said modding tools? Screw this. No one's stealing anything by using modding tools it's just obvious they want to lock down their product to milk out as much cash as they can. Well I'm one frankly tired customer. Get your together.
0;Absolutely fantastic game. Wonderfully written story amazing gameplay beautiful world to explore.I really think this is one of the best games of all time and I really wish I could recommend it to anyone who plays PC but it's missing one tiny little thing and I think a small handful of people out there might feel slightly disappointed that it's not there THE ABILITY TO MOD THE ING GAME
0;No mods no fun. Online ing blows unless you got buddies to play with. Long story short got banned b/c of a third party chat usage (Discord is apparently cheating) they never resolved my ban. Rockstar and you.Edit I got my account back but Rockstar still a bumass niBBa though.
0;So if you play GTA V for the single player it's a pretty decent purchase.Buuuuut Rockstar and Take Two decided to shut down a modding platform in a futile attempt to stop hacking. Given how Rockstar and Take Two act like money hacks for GTA O are like walking in to their safes and stealing money I'm pretty sure that the C&amp D was to preserve their shark card t which surprisingly people are actually dumb enough to buy.In short you Rockstar.

0;Forces you to use Social club as the access route to the game which renders using this game on a second account even with shared libraries useless. Wasted money dumb system. If you were able to maybe UNLINK steam accounts from Social club so that you're not locked to one account even if you have access to the game on another this would be a good game. Tl DRGame is a good game system and owners are not. Would not purchase on PC.
0;I'm standing up for the people that enjoyed modding this game although I didn't do it myself I find this a stain on creative freedom and the hours of fun people threw into this game. Look at Skyrim.. its still alive because of modding... Terminating this would've been a lot less bad had you come up with a steamworkshop or some other solution rather than just lazily killing it!
0;Jebaited TAKE TWO OUTDATED Jebaited ROCKSTAR OVERRATED Jebaited NO MODS INSTATED Jebaited OPENIV DEVASTATED Jebaited LONG WE HAVE WAITED Jebaited NOW WE JEBAITED JebaitedBut seriously screw you guys. You copyright claim a program for singleplayer mods yet don't do anything about rampant cheaters.
0;only expect to have fun on the online if you hack to give yourself money or enjoy a mobile phone level of grindor if you like shelling out 100$ for one sports carthe story mode is really good thoughi hope red dead redemption 2 doesn't end up like this (it looks like i haven't played recently but i play a lot on my ps4
0;PC version is dead? or was it just me? i don't want to recommand it at the same time i do cause i like gta 5 but nobody was playing jobs and nobody was in the 3 lobbies i joined the console version is most likely the most active still but considering the amount of reviews for this game about getting randomly banned must have killed the community.
0;Was alright till the banning of single player mods to push their online mode so they could sell microtransaction shark cards.DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you can hack in money from someone otherwise it has the same free to play grind mentality and you will spend hours grinding just to have fun.
0;lately i felt the online was relatively clear of cheaters (compared to last year)but the ban system is completly borked. was banned out of nowhere just keeping to myself doing bunker sales.no point in buying or playing a game that at the drop of a hat can undo all your efforts and feel nothing.
0;I have played this game for quite some time already I enjoy playing online as well as offline I have never used mods in this game but from the moment Take 2 decided to ban mods from GTA V I can no longer recommend this game until this situation is completely resolved.
0;I can't support GTA anymore. Their shady business practices in GTO have put me off ever playing again. It forces you into a horrible grind that makes it difficult to even have any fun. Shark Cards aren't even worth buying. That is if they don't ban you for buying one and suddenly having huge amounts of money.
0;these guys are horrible people they sent a cease and desist to a group of modders whos primary goal was to enhance your solo play experience. due to this they can now legally come after anyone for using mods on their game. Not just a ban but a real world legal issue. If you mod their games or have modded their games they could attempt legal action against you. Take two interactive has made themselves a clear threat to their community.
0;"""Been playing since release on ps3 then transfered the accout to pc when it came out. boucht shark cards along the way and stuff. Had a great time. Auto joined a session turns out there's a hacker in it I leave the lobby and search a new one. You have been banned...... sure. Asked """"support"""" but they won't help anyone......"""
0;Rockstar and TakeTwo don't care about anything but their bottom line. I've put 1100+ hours into this game and have recommended it to many people. I won't be buying RDR or any future Rockstar/TakeTwo game nor will I recommend any to anyone ever again. What killed my motivations for playing? Simple greedy developers.

0;Ok i'll admit i've had a lot of fun with this game and its' multiplayer however since the modding aspect of the game has been completely pushed out and they've recently released the Gunrunning update that only caters to richer players I simply have to say this F*ck you Rockstar and Take 2 you absolute f*cking c*nts. You've ruined the game for a majority of pc players and I hope you're happy you microtransaction f*cking w*ores.
0;Here's a thought Rockstar try banning modders. Essentially they will either keep buying the game which puts more money into your pockets or they'll stop modding which keeps the community happy. Eventually modding will slow down as modders won't want to keep paying out for the game and that's a plus for everyone.
0;This is one of the few games ive re bought multiple years in a row due to they kept re releasing it on new consoles followed by pc The multiplayer was fun but I took pride in the singleplayer modding like i have since san andreas. Taking away a feature that didnt effect the online preformance of the game or the micro transactions is just arrogant and takes almost all of the fun replayability of the single player there was away. I expected better. I was wrong.
0;"""I had this game on xbox 360 it was great. Got it on Pc yea it was great.... Until last weekend when I logged on to find my main character since day 1 (october 2013 or whatvever) gone.

0;Maybe if Rockstar had developed single player story expansions like they did for GTA IV(and planned on doing for GTA V) I would give a better review. Instead they coast on GTA online sales of cash cards and don't seem to give a about people who don't play online anymore. GIVE US MORE STORY PLEASE and let the modders do what they do to keep the community alive.
0;Go ahead If you're looking to play the stories or add some mods like the characters skins vehicles etc.If you're play with some friends that you knew well. Do jobs etc. It's fun but don't ever cheats it ruined the happiness of the game.ButDon't if you want to play the multiplayer alone. It's really really ed up. Bunch of cheaters random acts of players very noisy room etc. Go with the Playstation or Xbox version. I'd rather play the GTA SA Multiplayer
0;"""Single player is great but it you want access to all the extras you need to play online. That's where the nightmare begins. People shooting you from 10 miles away kids using """"orbital"""" weapons and other crazy pay for upgrades means you won't stand a chance of having a decent game without encountering the type of players that enjoy annoying others. There is no way to deal with this so I can't recommend playing this for anything other than single player."""
0;Yeah they ban people from the online version who have never used mods and are strict anti modder and then do not even review why the system did it. well theres 3 years down the hole for i and 5 of my crew. We were a group who reported modders as part of our crew creedo too. nothing but a complete letdown. and when they unbanned us after the set time they immediatly rebanned all of us permenantly without reason. Rockstar and Take Two you can go yourself with a hot iron spiked rod sideways.
0;I bought this twice once on Xbox 360 and once here.. i've paid 120 british pounds to take 2 the company that owns this game i bought it on xbox due to the hype.. and i bought it on PC for the mods which they're now taking away from us.. i cant refund this but i'll leave it a bad review untill they realise they're wrong to try and take away our mods. because lets be real they wont do till the media kick off about it
0;This game is trash. The Anti Cheat that they have right now is tollaly trash. A lot of legit players got ban for no reason at all. If you're looking for open world game I do not recomend this game at all. You're gonna waste your money cuz you're gonna get ban in the first hour of the game. Rockstar ruined their game.
0;I always come to GTA with really good mood to drive my cars around and do funny stuff but end up leaving the game after an hour thinking how can a game be. Honestly if you're looking at the reviews looking to buy the game DONT DO IT. The game is so ed up and what's even more? Rock ing star. Most ed up and greedy game company I know.Around 450 hrs played and sadly going to play couple hours more in future...
0;"""the new update came out i started the game up and i got a message saying """"your GTA online dollars has been adjusted by $8 498 918""""Half of my vehicles are missing and all of my apartment upgrades have been removed.Almost everyone has lost some money from this update.Is this their way of making people buy shark cards?"""
0;I bought this game for 40. yeah a bit pricey but I knew I'd enjoy it. I have spent about 4hrs in GTA online it doesn't float my boat. I have spent alot of time in single player yes using mods and I love them.but T2 said NO. This game is nothing to me without mods. That's the experience I want it for.
0;Been playing it for a while.. and today i got placed in the bad sport section.. just after i logged in in the evening.. Appartenly hackers can now use you as a fall guy if they want so you get stuck with a bad sport rating.. and a idiotic level and R* doesnt seem to be handeling any tickets about it.. So.. dont buy.. and if you do.. stay out of public lobby's before you get placed with bad sports for nothing.
0;Single player is good multiplayer became a pretty bad experience. The community is full of trolls and hackers. The content is only available if you pay a lot or grind endlessly while trying to avoid others(the trolls) in free play. It is no longer good for casual players.
0;Worst customer support ever. If you need it be prepared for automatic generic answears and not having your issue investigated.Don't buy anything from Rockstar.Pior servi�o de atendimento ao cliente que ja vi. Se tiver problemas com sua conta ou o jogo se prepare para receber respostas automaticas sem que seu problema seja investigado.N�o compre nada da Rockstar.

0;I bought GTA just for the online and it's one of the worst mistakes ever. First I was banned for using mods I admit. After uninstalling the mods and starting fresh people reported me and I GOT BANNED FOR NO REASON AT ALL. A hacker then dropped me money and I got banned.PLEASE dont buy this game on the PC unless your buying for single player.Buy it if its on a huge special like 80% off
0;Great story and characters coupled with very detailed recreation of LA and covered with excellent satire. On the other side unfortunately there is mediocre Online part with boring grindfest free but half DLCs and lobbies filled with mindless trigger happy kids. Only on sale for half price.
0;At online mode you have been banned from the GTA Online from no reason again and again.I have never use anny mod never cheat never interfear anybody in online mode.I have been banned from no reason then i inform back to support team and then...They iggonred to solve this issued. Manay people have been banned from no reason. (you can check it)I am not sure this is the strategy for sell this game again for the player have been banned.
0;"I am currently wasting my time in this game i suggest nobody should play this game until its fully fixed and i hope the developers read this cause their game is sh*t espacially ""PLAYERUNKNOWN"" Himself.Spending a whole year adding bullsh*t in this game and not caring about solving it's problems.it's still the same nothing changed."
0;Rockstar is anti modding there is nothing more to say. Why the would you be this anti modding? They are banning people for using a FOV fix since the FOV is locked to max 75 which is unplayed. And they are banning people for using Mods in Single Player. move Rockstar.
0;I do not recomend this game to a person who has low blood pressure or risk of heart attacks becouse this ing game will induce the out of both of those! I have validated the ing vfiles to this game over 20 times to still have the same failure in the en files. But Steam and Rockstar fail to provide me with the proper files to allow me to play this 70$ ING GAME! what a waste if u enjoy your money and time spent gameing do not purchese this game!
0;Take Two issued a cease and desist to OpenIV a core mechanic mod that was the lifeblood of many GTA4 and GTA5 mods. By issuing the C&amp D (nearly a decade after it first came to market) they have crippled vast swaths of the modding scene.Rockstar responded to the wave of negative press saying that it was blocked because of its involvement in recent malicious multiplayer hacking.(OpenIV is a single player only mod)(GTA online has always been a hacked to hell mess. This has not changed)....
0;Rockstar wanted online player to buy shark card they make the prices of the items in game very expensive you have two option to buy waht you want go buy a shark card or grind all day which you will make 800k/hour+ they make the megalodon shark card to only go 15% on sale now back then it was always 50%
0;Disgusting mutated growth of what Grand Theft Auto used to be. The online is more unbalanced then my hemorrhoids. all Pay to win If not then grind the next two/three months to get near your friends lvl. Then see all your cash disapear on the purchase of one car.Can't wait for 'Golden Horse cards' in RDR2 so I can get my Golden Spurs and Over powered as gun that only rich kids and people with no life can afford. R* can eat my crusty a s s hole.
0;I loved this game for 5 year but this week i was banned for no reason i could not email or complane about this.I love this game but when you get banned for reasons like being hacked or no reason or if it is just a mix up there is no way to get unbanned.
0;Singleplayer is Great one of the better games out there mods are awesome but only if they didn't ban mods for more Micro transactions in multiplater also the multiplayer scene is Really bad most loading screens take ages for everyone. also the price of everything in multiplayer is based on you buying the money with actual money. worst thing that could have happened to this Amazing game series.
0;It is absolutely disgusting what this game has turned into especially the multiplayer. And now with the cease and desist of a major mod used by many I can whole heartenly tell everyone that this game is not and probably never will be worth it. The same will likely be said for any future game that Take Two the owner company of Rockstar publishes.
0;So Take Two is shutting down Open IV in order to protect their garbage online money printer game mode despite Open IV not contributing to any mods that affect Online and Rockstar saying in the past that they support Open IV's contributions to their games and players. Quite honestly this game has had a pretty history in regards to its Online but this really is the pinnacle of both stupidity and greed. this game and the people who produce it.
0;A single player game turned multiplayer turned massive cash grab. Take Two wants you online so they can drain your wallet in a pay to win environment and thus decided to remove mods from singleplayer. I'm surprised they haven't outright removed singpleplayer the root of all evil that prevents them from earning more money.
0;Take Two has issued a cease and desist for OpenIV effectivly making all mods illigal to take players to their GTA Online where hackers can play without worries and victims are being banned. They just want to bring people to their online so that they could buy sharkcards that they can get more than the billions they already got from this...don't buy until they revert this decisionEDIT Seems like Take Two retracted their cease and desist but I'm still doubtful
0;I bought this game to play Los Santos Police Department First Responder.Take Two has decided to Cease and Desist the OpenIV team responsible for making mods possible.Take Two has killed modding in GTA V singleplayer just to protect their Shark Card profits.This is extremely unacceptable and I'm never buying a Take Two product again.Modding makes games survive years beyond when they should be garbage tier.Stop killing modding.
0;Good game... with messy poor optimization insultingly terrible technical supports made of automated replier and clueless staffs. Their solution to uncontrollable occurences of cheats and false anti cheat bans is to threaten good modders with lawsuits.
0;Game sucks. Not allowed to enjoy the game you paid for without the fun nazis over at Take Two getting their precious money. Mods made your lackluster game fun. Made it easier to deal with your terrible load times and ridulous hanging on load screens. Wheres that DLC for single player you stated you were bringing out YEARS AGO?Nah as long as players buys your shark cards like idiots you're laughing.. 
0;Rockstar and Take Two have shown all they care about is GTA Online's horrible microtransaction system by removing many of the abilities to exclusivel mod SINGLE PLAYER. This is totally insane. The economic system in Online is also horrible requiring tens of hours of boring repetitive gameplay of the same mission which give you the most money to get a good vehicle. you Rockstar and you Take Two.
0;I've literally just bought this game went through story mode and after 50 hours in online i've got banned with thousands of other players because of some dev crap that ruined so many accounts at onceAnd the funniest thing is that Rockstar doesn't even care about this they are just pretending there isn't a problem1000 banned accounts out of 10
0;I like many others have been banned in the March 2018 ban wave. Rockstar gives no form of appeal system. I won't try to convince you if I'm guilty or not. But there is no way that 100% of all bans are justified. Rockstar needs to change their policy in order to help those wrongly accused of modding. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU ARE OKAY WITH WASTING YOUR MONEY.
0;"""What in god's name is the point of taking the censorship of online chat to such an absurd degree as to restrict the use of the word """"eggplant"""" (which I didn't even know was a slur until this game told me as such) in a game where you murder people rob banks deal drugs and huff gasoline to pass the time?This is almost as silly as it is frustratingly pointless."""
0;"""Can't just sit here and not say something.... by taking away single player mods you're silencing the the creative community and killing what keeps games fresh and fun. GTA needs mods by the """"overwhelmingly negative"""" reviews in the past week I think others agree. SAVE OPEN IV https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv"""
0;Thanks Take Two Interactive.EDIT Not taking this down or changing my review. Dont get me wrong this game is a masterpiece (from my time in singleplayer) however Take Two screwed up royally by trying to get rid of singleplayer modding. So I'm keeping this review as negative as a reminder of that.
0;Take Two is actively trying to destroy the modding community. If this is allowed what's to stop other developers from doing the same in order to force their customers into using microtransactions to unlock new content or to level up faster? This must be stopped here and now. Rockstar and Take Two are multi billion dollar companies. They don't need more money.
0;Dear Rockstar/Take TwoIf you are unable to ensure that no script kiddies destroy the online habitat/enviroment of your game then this is the problem of your security architecture and not the problem of people who spend their free time to help other people have better gaming experiences through modding your (offline )product.
0;"""i once had like 14 mil until they """"corrected"""" it. then i used a lot of time to get almost 1 mil then they """"corrected"""" it again. DON'T BUY THIS IT'S REMOVES EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE I USED SEVERAL WEEKS TO GET THE 1 MIL AFTER THEY TOOK MY 14 MIL AND THEY REMOVED MY 14 MIL. (by """"corrected"""" i mean they took it and gave it the label """"corrected"""")"""
0;With Rockstar destroying the modding scene for this game which has been keeping their multiplayer up for a decade and also enacting this horrible P2W model inside a $60 game in a attempt to squeeze out as much money from the consumer as possible I can no longer recommend this game to anyone other than the singleplayer. Rockstar Has went full EA with this title. Be Warned.I give Grand Loading Screen Empty Server V a 2/5
0;If you're 13 and have your parents credit card ready then this is the game for you.If you're a modder with a good mod menu then this game is for you.You will eventually get a money reset / account ban just by being in a public lobby. The cash dropping / cheating is everywhere and the only punishment is to ban YOU not the modder )Enjoy your ban and remember! Get a good menu if you want to play without a ban )
0;Gameplay is repeadative and is hard to enjoy for a long time. Shark cards are being pushed hard because 12 year olds with their mom's credit card are a feccking money whale. Tons of modders.I liked the game I was just getting back into it and then I got an email from R* saying that I breached their EULA. I could not access the game for 30 days and all my progress was deleted. I do not recall a moment where I modded or glitched money or anything else.Good day and good riddance.
0;Be careful purchasing or buying this game. They suspend you and reset your character after 4 years of gameplay for no reason. They cannot tell you why or what you did. The suspension and resetting of your character is final and you cannot appeal it.GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors including modding in GTA Online exploiting or abusing game mechanics manipulating protected game data and code or otherwise interfering with other players gameplay experience.
0;i really like this game. the game is very good and really awesome but i don't recommend it. why? because hackers. i played the gta online and holy fk i hate finding hacker that took every single weapon you had. maybe i can just buy it again but do i fkin look i can afford buying everything again? for newbies it is very frustrating even for the people who is level above 100.you loose alot of money too because the hacker keep exploding you.
0;When i last played i loved this game it was GTA V.I just installed it again after a long break jumping on with a few friends do some CEO missions then whilst getting the shipment a bunch of flying missile wielding moto bikes attack us whilst we are trying to deliver a van..If i wanted to play Saintsrow i would have bought Saintsrow if this is the direction GTA is going then the GTA future will be one i dont invest any time into (
0;I have yet to be hit by the recent mass ban wave that's caught innocents in it's line of sight due to not launching the game to play online since the issue happened. Rockstar has said nothing about the false bans that have happened or if they will end up reverting them whenever this issue is fixed. Regardless anyone banned will have all of their money and progress wiped that they have spent time grinding out to get and the lack of communication on their part is unacceptable.
0;The story mode's pretty fun and the online mode is sometimes preferable to ebola. However if you're a cheap who wants R* to starve and won't buy at least one Whale Shark Card a month you might as well just pirate the and stop pretending you're not a disgusting thief.
0;I haven't even played this game in a long time nor used any mods on it but I still hate to see Take Two messing with the modding community of the game.Create a better anti cheating system rather than going after the modders who are just seeking to improve the singleplayer experience.
0;Grand Theft Auto Online has been nothing but a cash grab for some time now and I'm glad people are finally starting to stand up against it. GTA has always been a game about freedom and doing whatever the hell you want and Take Two have all over the playerbase for a long time now. The removal of mods does not impact me in the slightest but I'm tired of being treated like a talking wallet.
0;After 2 years nothin' changed expect the few ty wheels and expensive useless offices what you can buy from sharkcard of course.....RGSC keeps lagging all the time...Horrible loading times.....Playtime would be 75% Loading/25% Playing with cheaters....
0;"""I can say without hesitation that Grand Theft Auto V is one of my favorite games in my library. I've sunk a good chunk of my time into it and I would have recommended it to anyone who asked me about it that is until they start taking your in game cash away via """"Account Adjustments"""". Now all Rockstar wants is your REAL cash. Anyone want a Shark Card? I thought not..."""
0;Single player is great.Online is terrible. The load times are insane. Hard to find players for any game mode everyone just around in free roam. Hackers are abundant tho not always harmful. The cash grind is insane everything is expensive and it's intentionally designed this way to make Shark Cards (cost real money) more appealing. I don't hate all microtransactions but GTA Online has the most absurd pricing for them I've ever seen.
0;I loved this but Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive have proved countless times that they do not care about the community all they care about is money and recently they basically said modding is illegal so they killed a ton of their fan base despite all of this they change nothing they stay the same and it works because some of us let it work.
0;Take Two is lawyering up and kills modding communities to satisfy their own greed by selling mods and frustrating online play. Not recommended just because of this. We want to play the game exactly the way WE WANT TO PLAY THE GAME! Or we'll not play it at all. you Take Two!
0;"""What the actual where they thinking? """"Oh huh dur let us completely ruin modding for this game."""" Back when i did play this game I redone the storyline with mods and Enbs and the game was completely different far more enjoyable as well. Now i'm never ever coming back to this game and any further installment of Grand Theft Auto if this is going to be their stance."""
0;"""Why chaos letters so serious. I just bought the game just to play 9 hours you told me how I cheated. I seriously protest this behavior to stop this chaotic title phenomenon R stars noticed my comments people like your game you treat the player will sooner or later be players to """"title""""."""
0;DO NOT BUY! Rockstar bans everyone for no apparent reason when you try to get in touch with them they read off a script saying all bans are final and so on and do not care they just want your money and when they get it your buisness means nothing to them. I would never recommend such a game where developers do not care about there players.
0;As of June 16 2015 I would Strongly not recommend this game to anyone until Rockstar learns from their past mistakes and at least fix a simple problem of Memory leakage that existed back in GTA IV. Maybe one day a patch will come and fix this issue but until that day comes i don't recommend this game to anyone.
0;GTA 5 used to be one of my favourite games but now with the more recent updates i am quickly losing interest in the game because of rockstar/take two's stupid decisions like making everything super overpriced (forcing you in to buying shark cards) removing mods and making the payouts complete garbage (which makes farming very tedious)
0;Take Two have really shot themselves in the foot for their decision to send a cease and desist to OpenIV... ive never given a game a negative review until today.... we can not just sit around and let them destroy single player modding. I encourage you all to do the same protest against Rockstar and Take Two until they learn their lesson and fix this!
0;"""Had a review recommending GTA5 before but in face of recent events I will post a negative review. Modding is a healthy part of an ever growing community. Completely disabling it is even bigger non sense than Bethesda's move for """"paid mods"""". Get your together Take2.Sincerely probably everyone."""
0;Read the other negative reviews and see why they were banned. now guess why i was banned with 440 hours. so in short the games player base sucks the anti cheat system sucks the business model is scummy and its impossible to make money for the first hundred hours of gameplay do with that info as you will. right here is where i should say wait till rockstar fixes their but honestly dont even wait just never buy the game.
0;Single player It gud.Online It no gud. Overpriced items. Microtransactions. Mindnumbing grind system. Hackers and modders everywhere.Only buy if you want a good single player experience.If you want a good multiplayer experience DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's ing attrocious online.Optimization is gud too. Given the single player experience this game is really only worth like $30 $40 now. Having it still be $60 is disgusting.

0;Well when compared to Overkill Rockstar took a quite terrible way to deal with modding community.So these are what we got after they decided to take mods out from singleplayer.1.Hackers Hackers everywhere even they are banned as fast as possible.2.No MODs in singleplayer? Are you kidding me? 3.Sooooo god damned diifficult to earn your fortune in heists.Now GTAV became another game with open world but restricted gaming style.Rockstar good f*c*ing job.

0;Grand Theft Auto V is a great game. Don't get me wrong. But Take Two really shot themselves in the foot with taking down OpenIV. Mods are what makes this game fun. Especially since Rockstar obviously does not give a about adding proper single player content.
0;Support for OpenIV the largest modding platform by far has been shut down. Between that and and the microtransaction filled online and T2's attempts at sutting down any alternative to rockstar's online theres no real reason to pay anything close to full price for this game now.
0;The singleplayer is amazing the online is also amazing but beware they will ban you forever... that game that you just spent 60$ on yeah now you cant play it because rockstar deems you unworthy of playing their game you cant even buy it again you have to make an entirely new steam account because they wont let you unlink your steam and rockstar accounts.
0;"""Rather than funding useless lawsuits TakeTwo could have raised some funds for Rockstar to create a proper SDK Tool and distribute it along with a DLC.No they wanted to play the greedy capitalist """"Don't touch this this is my propriety"""" well if you are a potential buyer don't buy it fullprice find some shady key or some offshore seller."""
0;Don't buy this game. The developers are ing the community in the It's also plagued by hackers in which rockstar refuses to fix. Also there will NEVER be any singleplayer dlc even though it was promised to be released. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY BY BUYING THIS GAME.
0;Love the game play and the concept but cannot recommend the game due to the incessent &amp blatant hacking.. Even with Kill cam introduced in the 1.0 release these guys don't care and ruin the game for all the players. Until the developer starts to seriously look at the game communities concerns and addresses the issues around their loot reward concept i.e. selling clothing/ cratess for $$$ i am not sure you will see this game grow to anywhere near its potential.
0;3 words cease and desist Take 2 just ed everything that was good about the pc port. Yes there still is mods but the largest tool for modding Open IV just got ed for making the game fun.I bet most of the people writing the bad reviews came from someone like NerdCubed
0;The heist and other events in the game that involve lobbys a broken on PC It will automatically choose to go into freemode sometimes without considering you or your friends choice of what to do whether it be replay or shoose a different thing to play.
0;Well i only interested in the online and this game community is definitely terrible almost every session i go to there are hackers!!! It seem like cheater just cheat however they like and this ROCKSTAR publisher definitely isn't doing anything on it.https //i.imgur.com/lDPUPeY.jpgToday this stupid Chinese hacker wanjian1594 drop piles of vehicles onto me and screw up my sales
0;Although I am not one of the unfortunate players that have been wrongly banned from this game. I do not recommend buying this game UNTIL FailStar (Rock Star) sort thier out. I have a Friend who got thier account temp banned. He then uninstalled and re installed a fresh copy once his ban was lifted. 2hrs into his fresh install he is now Perm banned. Good on you FailStar Nice way of treating your playerbase!!!!!
0;"""grand theft auto is no longer a good game rasing prices for online in game dlc required items and cars to well over the games original worth is rediculus now their going after single player modding tool program developers to force people to play online and spend money on """"micro transactions"""" is for the slum lord's and scum bag's."""
0;I thought the game was mediocre when it first released. Now that Take Two made OpenIV cease and desist I have come to hate it.**NOTE**My lack of hours from the game is from when I refunded it because my PC was a potato back then. I had experience with the game on consoles but haven't played it since PC since my disc got laser burnt.
0;pros pretty sick game fun with friends gorgeous graphics endless possibilities great features killing randoms until they rq the lobby is satisfyingcons loading times are pretty bad you actually have to have no life to grind in order to make money stuck in cloud city a lot lester is extremely irritating moddersuntil you get banned for 30 days without knowing the reason why.will uninstall and probably never touch the game again.i love R* !
0;"""The CEO of a company who personally """"stays as far away as possible"""" from video games decides that the fourth best selling video game of all time isn't making him and his business nearly enough money. Rather than creating more video games they over one of the most loyal and dedicated parts of their game's fanbase. ing smart. you Strauss Zelnick and Take Two.... Greedy ing parasites."""
0;It's just great how the anti cheat system will ban someone and not tell them why. Then you call up Rockstar and they will also not tell you why you got banned or look into it at all. This happened to a friend of mine and he got banned for a month and will get all his stats reset after that time (Not that he is going to play again after this). I can not recommand this game now at all due to the bad customer server and very bad anti cheat system.
0;One of the longest and proudest traditions in all of GTA history is the modding community. TakeTwo just murdered it in cold blood. I'll be damned if they ever see another dime from me or anyone I have any influence over in this life. In the tradition of GTA games everywhere Go yourself TakeTwo!
0;I really want to like the game but Rockstar is making it difficult. Many people (including me once) has been banned for no reason on the online version and the singleplayer never gets updated. It seems they are making so much money from GTA Online that they have completely forgot they have an offline version as well which is sad for us who loves (and perhaps prefers) singleplayer games.
0;DO NOT EVER BUY THIS! If you buy it all you are doing is forcing gaming down the of microtransactions. Take Two killed the modding community just because they wanted people to pay for more microtransactions. By buying this game or anything in it you are telling them that this behavior is fine. We have to stand up against these money hungry If you spend any money on this game or any Take Two game you are causing the collapse of the gaming industry.
0;I refused to buy this trash game when Rockstar wouldn't let me transfer all my hard work and millions in my 360 account to the Xbox One. I'm not spending 100s of hours again or giving this mass murder simulator supporting company any money for Shark Cards.
0;My account that is clean got banned without any justification by rockstar. The ban is allegedly caused by the new anti cheat they made. I lost all my progress due to their mistake how is this fair? well they will not play fair. so might as well start the backlash bois. Lets just wait if they will fix this and give the compensation we all deserve
0;"""They rarely listen to what the people playing ask for more bugs than features plus """"well those bugs that made you lose your $1 670 000 car is still in there but now there are MORE CARS!"""" I like the updates but they need to focus on what's really important a playable online game"""
0;"""Take Two deciding to stop OpenIV coupled with the fact that the game refuses to start because """"it can't connect to the internet"""" no matter what I try gets a negative review from me I used to like this game and company sad how they ruined their hard earned reputation in a few months"""
0;Totally game is OK. But bugs in this game are just insane. Don t buy it unless you is a guy who like to make pain yourself.Developers don t listen to players. The only thing which matters them is SharkCards. Multiplayer is filled with hackers. They are in game for hmmm... I suppose few years and Rockstar is doing nothing to stop they. Instead they are just **** players in their asses as hard as possible. You buying a game but getting a piece of And Loading Screen will be your best friend.
0;As much as I enjoy this and all of the other GTA games if you actively try to supress the community for your game you do not deserve support. This change of support for modding by Take Two is fueled entirely by a desire to monetize the multiplayer and force more people from the singleplayer to the multiplayer.
0;The game is phenomenal on it's own yes but as of Mid 2017 due to legal issues Rockstar and their parent company Take Two Interactive decided to shut down PC mods entirely. Again truely the game is great one way or the other but this anti consumer mindset cannot go unpunished.
0;rs is so that they can fix their own game i have 600+ hours online and every update i hope it maybe gets better but no it will never get better i wich i cud get a revund or somting big wast of money and life dont buy this crap for onlinenever modded 800+ hours of grinding and work to get all the i have + got alot of shark cards so that i woot not get banned becose of the modded money wtf is this instead of banning the honest playes bann the damm modders ing idiots..
0;Cease and Desist to OpenIV staff. I paid for a product that I soon will not be using anymore. I refuse to give any more money to such a greedy company.Microtransactions are awful.The new DLC is just pitiful at this point.The game was fun when I could do what I wanted with it. GTA5 is dead.
0;This Review is only for GTA OnlineLong loading screens even with a SSD and a unstable Netcode dampen the experience severly. More than once me and my friends got disconnected from the server or couldn't see each other ingame or the game turned into a slideshow for the guy on passenger seat. This was especially annoying during heists and ruined most of our fun. Rockstar had to two years to fix this issue.
0;The reason I bought GTA was modding. Not cheating but I love to play LCPDFR mode with new cars kr uniforms etc. Banning our favorite tool made me angry and I don't suppkrt this game anymore. They have taken the fun out of this game so niw it is usuless. Don't recommend anyone to buy this game anymore.
0;I used to love this game but now i don't. i won't even recommend it to my friends. so much disappointment from the publishers greed of money. don't buy this on sale. won't be changing reviews until got an official statements from OpenIV and R* regarding the issue
0;Don't purchase. Rockstar has been banning a lot of innocent accounts for no reason at all including accounts that have only existed for just a few hours. They've shown no motivation to actually correct this problem because they get enough money from console players. My friend has never modded and lost his whole account progress over this glitch. Avoid at all costs.
0;Full of bugs even after few years running. It is fun but still I wont recomment this game. Singleplayer is kinda boring some missions are okay. Muliplayer is a complete disaster. Loading screen takes too much so i can call this game a loading screen simulator xD Anyways dissapointed in the game rockstar not realy doing anything. Money was a waste.
0;Game is plagued by players with a kill on site attitude. Half the weapons and vehicles in the game shouldnt exist. Money is extremly hard to come by if your not doing gamemodes. Servers are messing up 99.99999% of the time. You will wait more in loading screens than actually playing the game. Gamemodes are more buggy than any other game i have ever seen. Rockstar support is terrible. Only get this game if you have the highest amount of patience.
0;After 3466 hours of enjoyable gameplay and hitting level 550.My account got hacked and banned then reset. Thanks tar no appealing process just straight up ban. After 3 4 years and numerous copies on a few different platforms same character why would I need to hack? Up yours rock star. Shove red dead 2 up your
0;Really wish the developers would put their efforts into fixing bugs UI problems and getting rid of the absurd amount of blatant hackers that have plagued this game for ages instead of patching money glitches in mere hours to make sure you have to grind your balls off or spend a ton of money to get the good stuff and then refusing to even think about the other issues in desperate need of attention.
0;They completely ed why i bought this game by sending a decease and desist letter to the makers of the OpenIV mod.This mod is the backbone of GTA modding and has been for years without it tons of mods will stop working entirely.Modding is why i bought GTA and its the reason i came back time and again to about but by doing this they're ing over a community of people that mod and especially the modders who put their free time into making mods that without OpenIV WON'T WORK.
0;Over 1000 hours and now I just don't want to play anymore. At this point if you dont have the game dont bother since the best of the community left long ago. This sandbox is still fairly amazing as long as you have the money (which you wont) but without the real community there the worlds just dead even at its best.
0;I have to say that this one is one of the worst game I ever buy the online take a LOT of time to join (and the lag is crazy) 1/4 of matchs have at least one hacker...Btw the single player is good enough to buy this game con sale (BUT I DONT RECOMEND THIS buy another game instead)
0;I don't play this game anymore but Mods were the reason I put more than 100 hours in single player alone. So Take Two's decision to ban OpenIV makes this game loses its unique and fun experience on PC. And more importantly Take Two took every consumer's right to do whatever they want with a product they paid 60$ for. So for these reasons I don't recommend this game unless Take Two backs off their actions
0;This is not the game people would buy from rockstar games.People have been modding games on the pc since they were created and this game is the first one to ban modding even on single player. They really took it too far and I don't recommend you to buy any games published by Rockstar Games
0;The cease and desist letter by Take Two Interactive to Open IV should become a textbook example of how NOT to treat your target market.This also creates a very worrying precedent Future incarnations of the GTA series might not have mod compatibility (thus robbing the relatively unlimited potential of the GTA franchise we have all come to love).If you happen upon this review just do me (and yourself) a favour Remember to check if future GTA games have modding capabilities before purchasing.
0;Before I start just let me say that the single player like everyone else says is amazing and fun. However the online aspect has the appeal of a naked run through a field of cactus so unless you love to cheat or just like making peoples lives hard stay very far away from GTA Online.
0;as much as I kind of hate to do this I'm voting down the game in protest of Take Two Interactive's more or less BANNING of modding the main reason many buy a PC port of a game as did I originally so F**K YOU Take Two! R* have even SHOWCASED mods on their Blog saying that they completely support modding so F**K YOU TAKE TWO!
0;I'd like to ask you for a full refund! U do NOTHING with modders and macros users. Now then can disconnect players from session. In every session there's atleast 2 modders. There's no interest to play vs modders and macros users no challenge coz u'll loose anyway.
0;There needs to be more support for the modding community and the recent actions of Take Two are unacceptable. The greed of Rockstar and Take Two and their approach when it comes to buying Shark Cards is poisoning gaming. Don't support this type of practice stay away from this game.
0;Once a shining new standard for games in 2013 now a stagnant shell with nothing but trivial online content added behind the usual grind or pay system. Removal of mod support has made this just another 5 year old game that has already made record profits asking for more money.
0;you Rockstar. I pre ordered this garbage A YEAR before it came out. I was expecting a San Andreas 2 but all I got was a lot of nickle and diminig castrated modding and a giant world with nothing to do. I ing hate the direction you're taking the series. I know you won't ever listen since every game is a guaranteed success and you have no reason to change anything but destroying the last bit of modding left in this game is inexcusable. I hate GTA O and I hate you Rockstar.
0;As much as I loved this game I simply cannot recommend. The story is great but boring once 100%. GTA Online is really trash and the only means of getting money legitimately is to grind (which you only get one car out of) or to buy shark cards (their way of getting money even though this game is selling like crazy across the PC and Console platforms). Modding is the only way of fun. You're better off watching videos on GTAO instead of playing this game.
0;I loved Grand Theft Auto 5 it was amazing with the endless amount of mods for single player like LSPDFR. But know since mods are banned It really sucks paying all of this money when you are going to get bord of this game. I also dislike that they took away the moding tools so they can make more money off the game. Im done with this game now and im done with rockstar! GTA online Sucks people are jurks on there and you cant do anything. #BRINGMODSBACK #ROCKSTARSUCKS
0;I modded GTA Online and am currently level 1069 and have over a trillion dollars. I have yet to be banned. Yet a bunch of entirely legitimate players people who actually spent money on shark cards and worked their asses off get banned? The is going on here Rockstar?
0;Go play the Solo game for the multiplayer stick to the mission and the heists the freemode is not worth it at allLeaving a negative review because of the horrible state of the multiplayer which is a huge part of why the game still exist and isn't simply dead and how Rockstar did nothing about the massive amount of unfairly banned players and the astonishing amount of cheaters on the game also the community of this multiplayer is one of the most toxic I have seen of all my years of gaming
0;Buy knowing that only half of the game is actually trully playable and that would be the single player. Online is a joke. Modders in every lobby doing what they please w/o reprecussion an anti cheat system that bans legit players instead of modders/hackers and such poor staff that they've ignored most of what players have been saying for years now. Story is awesome online has been trash for a while...
0;I didn't use a plug in. I didn't interfere with other players playing games. There was no reason to be a title. You did not have human rights. ! ! ! On March 23th I logged into the game normally and completed the game task without any external actions nor any action that interfered with the player. Everything in my game is normal behavior. Untitled was sealed until April 23 2018 Please solve the cover
0;If you get this game only the story mode is worth bothering with. GTA online is complete and should be avoided like the plague false bans are rampant and Rockstar point blank refuse to take any responsibility for the mess. All told definitely NOT worth the price.
0;Can't recommend.It's a ing premium game AAA price yet the cash hungry jackals pf Take2 milk the multiplayer more than some free2play games do.Take2 is a prime example of unlimited greed ruining the gaming industry so I can't recommend supporting this.
0;GTA V is a fun game but it is also one of the most annoying games to start up and play for longer than 10 min. The reason why is because it either crashes or loads for 15 minutes everytime i finish a heist join a new loby or try to play any mini games. In all GTA V is one of the worst games i have ever played and really wish that you spent any of your million dollars to help the game at all.
0;"""let people who wants free $$$ have free cash if they dont like what the modder is doing (giving them money without consent or teleporting them and killing them) then report themn BUT FOR GOD SAKES LET THE PEOPLE WHO WANT THE MODS HAVE THE MODS WHO CARES IF THEY HAS 999 999 999 999 ING DOLLARS IF THAT PERSON IS PICKING ON A NOOB THERE IS A ING """"FIND NEW SESSION"""" BUTTON FOR A REASON!"""
0;"""Surprised I played 120 Hours on the game.Its fun for like 20 minutes lol. Too much importance on money than the actual purpose""""Grand theft auto"""" stealing cars not buying them. Damage on cars is unrealistic. Psychic's on cars and fighting is terrible. The only thing I enjoy is uh.. Well.. Um. The uh.. The guns..."""
0;Havent played anything but races the last 5 months. Logs on after two weeks of inactivity and my user is banned. WTF Rockstar? These random bans need to stop. Only thing the game tells you when you are banned is that you are banned no reason no date of bann. I would recommend this game to everyone if it hadnt been for the random banning. I have 380 hours wasted now.
0;Got a 30 day suspension for no reason no mods no exploites nothing just a random suspension and character reset rockstar I can't even appeal it and they closed my support ticket half an hour after I submitted it they ignore their players and ban people at random while I see modders run around unchecked dropping cash on players and then those players get banned instead of the modders don't buy this
0;Just no... They make it look fun your mind will change when you see the ton of microtransactions. This is pay to win or grind through hell to have decent things. Bans are dishing out left and right for no reason... Absolute trash game. Don't fall for this like I did. This is just eye candy. It looks good but it doesn't taste good.
0;I will never pay for any game Rockstar puts out Reasons 1 worst support service ever (Note I have not been banned)2 cheaters on every server3 Rockstar is so very very VERY greedy!!!!!!!4 Rockstar does not care about their customers in ANY waySingle player was fun but never again will rockstar get a cent from me
0;the game itself is awesome.. but modders completely ruin it online constantly.. lucky to get an ho0ur of game play in before a modder comes a long and screws up everything.. now they can even get everyone banned from their own organizations all at once.. so stupid. if you are one of these modders.. please die.
0;Don't support these schlubs.PUBG has filed a law suit against Epic Games on false copyright protection grounds. Pubg Bluehole Brendan Greene you can all go rot in hell. Your values as a company are compareable to Konami and I can't wait to see you lose this battle.
0;Terrible maintained game ya dingus crashes frequently constant issue with very long login time for GTA online so y ou sit there like a turkey offline mode is great. Need to fix these bugs for such a long standing game. I'm Dr. Steve Brule For your health.
0;"""I hadn't played for a while and got on. It worked great for a while and i logged off for a time and afetr logging back on it game me a message saying that i was banned for a month and was having my Online character errased. As i have done more research it seems that the new update might have cause the issue which doesn't making anthing better. In short Rockstar make a big """"OOF""""."""
0;Bastradss the anti cheat is tt Got banned back in 2017 and tried fighting the ban and called and everyone there is just a bunch of fat with no life No pun intended. It is GRAND THEFT you damn bunghole! I just want my 30 dollars back to go eat more Mcdanks bro. GTA bro shiit is boring as anyway. My hours are my idle count because I got BORED and did not care Have a nice day you no life smelly wet hairy toenail eating figure.
0;This game pisses me off. UPDATE still pisses me off it needs alot of work to be a good game. Constant lags and gltches even in it's baby stage. updates take forever to come around. slolwly getting tired of this game and the constant struggles it brings to the point where it no longer becomes enjoyable to play.
0;Rockstar you started out so well so pure and caring but now? Why does no one drive normal cars in this car anymore?Furthermore your flying bikes they are ruining the game so badly if you use an Oppressor you suck everyone hates you and it makes you look like you can't play the game properaly.Rockstar clearly just used GTA online in the end as a cash cow and stopped caring about the players a long time ago save for RDR2
0;The game itself is fun however Take Two has ruined the online portion AND the single player by ruining the modding community and forcing people to either buy shark cards or get banned because another cheater joins your server and gets you nuked in the process forcing you to buy the game again. Stick to friend only games have fun spending an eternity grinding for money and watch your back 24/7 in public lobbies. 7/10 gameplay because bugs and terrible grinding process 2/10 customer service.
0;What are you guys playing? I m supposed to play Grand Theft Auto V but this one company keeps stealing my money.Is it Take Two?!Yeah Take Two.Who is Take Two?Some say Take Two is the first greedy company ever.Born from hell.I heard Take Two can take a wheelbarrow full of money from players.I heard Take Two once shutdown a modding group with a single blow.But the worst part is just when you think you re safe just when you think you might escape WHAM!!! You lose money getting banned or sued!!!
0;"""Game itself is fun but you won't be doing much of that as most of the time you spend loading and hoping the game doesn't crash. My game crashes very often and even more commons are the errors while loading. Rockstar's solution to these errors are """"Wait for 4 hours and try again"""" Doesn't sound too good right? Rather spend your money on some other junk!"""
0;I do not recommend this game. I was banned for 30 days and called them and they wouldn't tell me why I was banned. I get unbanned and then after 1 day get permanently banned. I call them again and THEN THEY TELL ME I GOT BANNED FOR MODDING?!?!?! I know you probably don't believe this but I never modded on my life. Rockstar Games is literally banning honest players and ruining the experience for them. I hope they change someone in GTA 6 or looks like online will stay bad. Rip.
0;The game is amazingly fun and challenging. It is one of the best (if not the BEST) Battle Royale game out there.But this game has a virus. And this virus comes in the form of Cheaters/Hackers. Since the 1.0 Update there seems to be a massive amount of Hackers. It is slowly killing this game. And the problem with cheaters mostly comes from Chinese players and from BattleEye just being unable (or taking to long) in banning players.So right now i can't recommend the game as it is.
0;Product received for free. GTA OnlineGreedy producers overpriced content hackers everywhere toxic community horrible AI endless loading screens buggy far too weaponized misleading title and tryhards everywhere. Want to drive around with a sportscar in a public session? Forget it you'll be locked onto by a flying car for and giggles. If they could simply add the Online content to storymode that would be awesome.
0;This game was great when first released but has since been overrun with modding cheater holes. It it literally impossible to join a server with more than 4 people and not have someone who is cheating. I don't know if Rockstar doesn't care or is just too incompetent to ban any of the hundreds of people I have reported but they are making absolutely no apparent progress in cleaning the online community.
0;This game is nothing but trouble. Online play is filled with nothing but jerks and hackers. Hackers have the ability to remove weapons spawn items on top of you kick you from sessions and block you from being a CEO to make money. Until rockstar bans all hackers and modders and changes from a peer to peer system to a dedicated server system I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you're prepared for game or even PC crashes due to no good a**holes.
0;2018 Edit The Single Player is excellent. Don't buy this game for online though. It's really bad and a cash grab. Also 60 Euros for a 3 year old game (5 years if you count original release) is a joke. Buy on sale People buy your game to play modsYou shut down modsYou are pretty stupid
0;Multiplayer is absolutely ing ruined in game economy is trash and broken over militarised hackers everywhere basically saint's row but 10 times worse and more toxic. Only good part of this game is the singleplayer.+ Update two days later after critisicing the game for the first time and would you know I got perma banned online despite being clean no reason given at all and their toxic support system doesn't allow appeals. R*.
0;When you play almost 600 hours log back in after almost a year and get banned.No response from rockstar on support tickets or twitter nice.Especially nice when you get another copy on sale and that one gets banned as well. Good Job rockstar ban the people that actually want to play your game. That's a great idea.
0;Logged in for the first time in months yesterday. Went to play again today only to find that I'd been banned despite only travelling to my Bunker to check supplies yesterday. Not even a reason why.I had a lot of fun playing this with friends but won't be buying any RockStar games in the future. The developers don't deserve to be supported even for single player.
0;The game has an anti modding policy and kills community projects. The anti cheat is horrible almost non existing.The online mode is p2p based with long loading times.To be honest the game is really fun to play but not with the pay2win/insanely grindy (like playing 20 hours to get a vehicle grindy) aspect. Maybe a cheater gave me a bunch of money which made the game enjoyable for me or maybe I just made that up.
0;Rename this game Loading Simulator. The connectivity issues &amp bugs has gotten way out of hand. Frankly it looks like they've given up all hope on stable servers and reliable gameplay. Too many hackers and way to little effort to deal with them. Pay2Win Extreme EditionWould not recommend this game if you like to actually do anything other than constantly disconnect never get to join in the first place or just get bugged to oblivion...
0;GTA V is nothing more than a glorified MP game. The SP experince has been neutered in favor of the MP micro transaction business model. The SP part is extremely short and not as well thought out as San Andreas. Yes the world is huge but there are far less things you can interact with in SP vs MP. If you're looking for a fantastic SP GTA experience go back to San Andreas. Saying that this game blows is an understatement. Looks like Rockstar has turned into a bunch of posers.
0;This review is only about GTA V ONLINE.So I started out having a lot of fun but it started to feel like I have to do a lot of grinding and I REALLY hate grinding in games. And at a point it felt like I had to pay to win. What makes it even harder is that when you do grind you have to deal with people who have the crazy new car with guns mounted on it or something! I thought the game was suppose to be realistic but at this point it's just pay to win.
0;The sole reason why I bought this game on PC was for the Single Player Mods.Now that Take 2 is killing it I have no reason to play on PC.If I ever want to play this game again it might be on my PS4 and in that case I'll just rent it or perhaps borrow it from a friend.
0;I will not buy another Rockstar game until they can demonstrate they know how to support a game and deliver on their advertising promises. The multiplayer is broken and unplayable the mandatory social club is annoying the false sale is insulting and the rules on mods are unreasonable and restrictive.DONT spend $60 on this $20 game.
0;Without even getting into the whole mod ordeal.I have spent more time messing with settings than actual gameplay trying different combos delusionally hoping that I would find a particular setup that allows gameplay that doesn't hiccup.What a waste.i7 4790 Asus 980 strix16GB RamGame installed on crucial ssd
0;I like this game i like the beautiful graphic and good story but this game is filled up with hackers. I dont like the online Matchmaking for example in stealth missions or races. The matchmaking will give you too good mates in races and too bad people in stealth missions.
0;From getting mods finaly after years on a Fallout 4 and also starting in Skyrim and adding mods to that. It litterally made my games feel 10x better. What Take 2 has dictated as you cant mod your game its end user as you cant modd your game. That you even if off line cant even have mods in this era of gaming is like a step back. Simply 10yrs of OK then flip it is sad. Fix your online hackers before hatting on modders. So sorry dont help them rack in them dumster turcks of money
0;Solid single player experience but once its over its pretty boring. The online is extremely grindy and repetitive to the point of getting no where when trying to earn items/cash. Pretty much forced to use micro transactions.R* Promised single player DLC and never delivered. Pretty disappointing experience from one of my favorite companies.
0;Product received for free. Honestly I'm having a ton of fun with this game but I don't really think I would recommend it. It requires a TON of grinding and there are hackers everywhere that Rockstar will not do anything about. I would be fine with the grinding if hackers weren't in every other lobby blowing everyone up constantly.
0;Take Two I really hope you're going to do something to ease the raging inferno that's going on throughout the GTA modding community.I love the game but I currently can't recommend it until some form of solution can be made so that modders can still freely mod the single player portion as they wish while allowing the multiplayer portion to run with fewer risks of running into cheaters.
0;used to be one of the greatest online experiences I ever had turned into a hackfest with absolute brainless grind to get anything past vanilla content.story mode/offline play still a masterpiece thoughedit since take two and rockstar decided to ban players and prohibit ANY MOD in the OFFLINE play this game turned into utter
0;Used to be a great game. Ruined by Rockstar's money hungry tendencies for micro transactions and making in game purchases so expensive and mission rewards so low that its near impossible to grind enough to afford anything. Sad how far its gone downhill.
0;&gt one day before steam sale&gt R* raises price of GTA V from 60 to 80 dollars&gt put it on sale 25% off so it is back down to 60 and appears like a good deal&gt thinks customers are big enough idiots to fall for it&gt lol&gt 11/10 would get ed over by you mofos again&gt gg R*
0;As a Gta 5 Youtuber That needs mods to make them I am hating those Two Whatever e r s For taking away Open IV from us. Not to mention that Online is insanely now because all there is are piles and piles of new cars and wierd missions and features being added that require a butt load of in game money to buy and opererate and the only way to truly get the money in game is to grind for so many hours or just buy shark cards (Which Rockstar wants xD)Single Player GoodOnline Badlol k
0;Good game but can't recommend due to Rockstar's shady practices...Banning people who paid 60 freakin dollars because they use mods to enhance their SP experience is abhorrent and violates the basic principles of PC gaming. It's made even more ridiculous by the fact that most of these mods are harmless graphical fixes (such as the FOV mod) which serve to improve the already awesome game that rockstar has developed.I hope the developers change their stance about this and do it soon.
0;its a good game with all the pc crashes glitches black screens freezes making my desktop icons vanish bsod screen flickering low memory when it isnt memory leaks and also been reading about ppl being banned for no reason too all i can say is save ur money and wait till there r fixes for it for this version go buy the witcher III or something i think i made a mistake lol its a good game it just would be even better if all that crap wasnt messing up.
0;A fantastic game though with multiplayer ruined by rampant hackers/modders/cheaters/script kids. I'm only in it for the multiplayer so to me the game is no longer fit for purpose and cannot recommend it at this moment in time. I just hope R* can implement some anti cheat measures before they alienate the legitimate players.
0;Nice job ruining the only reason I played your newest game. I missed GTA IV's style of online and you completely dissapointed me with this new version of online. Despite that fact I loved the story and and offline modding. We'll now all I've got is story mode with no mods so I may end up completely deleting this game now that I can't really experience anything new without paying s of money to play the garbage pay2win online mode.
0;It is impossible to say anything good about this game after what Take Two has done to the modding scene of this game. The game shows what happens when a company is only interested about squeezing every penny they can get out of a game. They're trying to draw people to GTA Online (which over the last 18 months has been completely ruined by microtransactions) by banning modding on the singleplayer. This is unbelieveably scummy and Take Two must be told that this is unacceptable.
0;152 hours of game play never cheated never hacked. Played on invite only maps with one other person and some how I got banned. Sent multiple emails and always got automated responses within 30 seconds of sending. I will never buy another Rockstar game nor will I ever recommned it in fact I will tell everyone to buy another game where the Devs actaully take time to respond to their paying customers.
0;"""Takes over an hour to get three people into the same session only to have """"Hacker"""" / """"Modder"""" freeze all players in the session or to repeatedly blow you up whilst you're in a safe zone (apartment) or to spawn scenery and vehicles around you to lag out your game.Shame single player was actually really good."""
0;Bring back singleplayer mods you moneygrubbing hacks!If you don't know what i'm talking about Rockstar's parent company is issuing cease and desist letters to creators of singleplayer mods in an effort to force people to play online so they can boost thier profit through microtransactions. This is removing mods that allow updated content that is only normally acessible in online play to be acessed in singleplayer such as new weapons and vehicles. It's t and it needs to stop now
0;"""Stay as far away from this game as possible.It used to be fun but now every single lobby is filled with exploiters. Literally the chances of you joining a lobby without an exploiter is very rare. It has completely ruined the quality of the game.Aside from that if you want any cool vehicles or have any fun at all you need to pay real money for """"shark cards."""" It's a ridiculous business model."""
0;Pros Singleplayer is good the game looks good and it's fun to play with only your well civilized non douchey friends. Cons every player you will ever meet in online is a Rockstar has a lack of caring about the community the game has become honey bunches of hackers and you have to do a bunch of BS for the smallest amount of money.
0;Actively shutting down 100% legal singleplayer modding tools after refusing to develop pretty much anything for singleplayer post launch should not be encouraged.EDIT Open IV had a successful petition and were able to keep the program running so beside's my before stated point. The game is fantastic and I recommend it for anyone with a need to blow up.
0;The overall constant push to buy shark cards has ruined this game. It is impossible to get any substantial amount of money without buying said shark cards. All new content requires players to be in a Public Online Session which makes it almost impossible to even play as other plays focus on killing you while you're racing to finish in time. Biker gang and SecuroSrv give no reason for other players to help you as they get pennies while you get quarters...
0;"""Rockstar you dissapoint me. Screw. You.If you don't fix this greedy """"sale"""" t you can say goodbye to me as a customer.Don't your customers over with this kind of or you'll be nothing but another EA and/or Activision.Do not support these people until they learn that we will NOT accept this type of greedy business practice."""
0;"""I wanted to like this game really I did I tried giving it second chances multiple times playing it with friends online but at this point it's too late GTA V dug it's own grave what with the playerbase being flat out cancerous with hackers trolls or just that """"one guy in a jet or whatever"""" on top of all the problems Rockstar flat out just doesn't really help you out when you need it. If all of this ever changes I'd gladly play in a heartbeat but honestly and sadly I think it never will"""
0;After over a year of playing this game it still takes forever to load and feels sluggish and unomptimized. Im tired of mediocre content constantly being added to seemingly distract the players from the fact that the game is still pretty much in pre alpha gameplay wise. Not just PUBG is guilty of this and it is frustrating. Still the game could be so good if they just spent some time making it feel snappy and optimized.
0;While Take Two continues their jewish world domination effort not realizing that literally everyone with a brain is against them. Much as I wouldn't like Rockstar to be hurt by Take Two's greed arrogance and general stupidity they just gotta tell Take Two to themselves.
0;Not recomended at all. Lot of bugs on maps you will be stuck on map or kicked out of the car for no reason ...Hitmodel totally screwed your arm works like vest level4 ....Close combat is totaly random due ping lag and strange guns beahavior.Every update brings new bugs .After one year is still in beta. They call it version 1 it is just for earn more money make more sad players on another platform etc.DON'T LET THEM STEAL YOUR MONEY.
0;one word PAYWALLto play the game fully you can do three things.1.Grind forever to buy everything2.Hand your wallet to Rockstar to buy everything3.Pay 10 quid to get 500m in your accountI used to play this game on PS3 and PS4 it was great but after the OG hiests update everything got way too expensive and the game has lost any fun it did have.Ta Rockstar for being greedy
0;Im baned for enternity now i did mod but i had no idea of bans and i did stop after 2 and someone else gave me money still banned me if u dont want modders make a way to disable mods online use steam mod store or something dont be a game and i only did it cause unless you want to pay hundreds of dollars or spend every waking minute on this game you have to to get money but now that theyve been and taken away mods why cant everyone get unbanned
0;I can t ing believe that you destroy the hard work of tens of thousands of modders that tried to make the game better that you destroy the years of work of whole modding teams destroying a huge community because you assumed that OpenIV is responsible for the cheats? I have never experience something so unfair so stupid and so unbelievably ing pointless and dumb in my whole life I literally can t express how ing mad I am.
0;"""Just got banned for nothing while doing a heist with my friend. My account is suspended for 30 days and my character is deleted with all the years of progress with it gone. I was going to submit a ticket but Rockstar rather close their ears and yell """"LALALALALALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU"""" then help."""
0;I'm done buying your games Take Two. Getting rid of OpenIV was the BIGGEST MISTAKE you could ever have made! I only got GTA V so I could play with mods offline. Now it's pointless to have it in my library because it was the only thing keeping me playing. F*** you!
0;The online part has seriously gone down hill over the years.Takes longer to buy s**t and there are still several issues that have not been addressed.If you don't already own the game crack the game for the single player and tell the online part to go F*** it self.
0;GTA online is absolutely atrocious it adds hours of aggresively mediocre new content that are only available through glitching cheating or as many have complained hundreds of hours of grinding to gain access to. Playing online is truly the most frustrating boring and unpleasant experience. Don't play it and much less spend any amount of money on it or otherwise rockstar will never move on to new and better things.
0;Rockstar only want you to have fun on their terms so long as you pay for it in microtransactions...Even with cheats you'll only have fun for a while until you run out of stupid things to do with them.Here's an idea rockstar... Actually put thought into your Online overworld design and make it you know... FUN? Then maybe cheat's wouldn't be so rampant
0;Don't buy this. Spent hours and hours on this game got rolled back twice. Got my money taken away that was earned trought grinding heists. Every online lobby has a modder in it if you can even get past the 12 minute loading screen even on great rigs. Terrible matchmaking nowadays mostly played by younger folk that beg in lobbies for cash.Long story short great single player but it's not worth the money. You'll just risk being banned for just being on GTA Multiplayer.
0;"""Drip feeding content when there is content they add things that are over saturated like super cars bad servers that take 20 minutes to load and the WORST thing about playing online are the scriptkiddies that use mods to godmode and forcibly crash your game.The single player is good but all of the sudden it seems like Rockstar forgot about it no updates and no """"single player DLC"""" like they promised."""
0;"""Absolutely trash game to join if you're joining late. I don't like using """"mods"""" or """"glitches"""" or any work arounds to get ahead. So if you're trying to advance...good luck. If you're not getting continuously assaulted by more seasoned players with nothing better to do whatever businesses you buy will get raided and you'll most likely die and have to start from the ground up constantly. This game milks you of shark cards. I'm so done."""
0;Excellent Gameplay but an awful community. I can not reccomend the game because of how awful the community is. Players constantly leave heists and are toxic bored high level players will make your life a nightmare and many more terrible things. If you have friends this game it is very fun if not... stick to singleplayer
0;do not buy this game! even if you think it's a great game do not buy it. the community is all the players use codes to kill you it takes a lot of time to get in the game and often gets stuck. it's worth buying only if you have 4 friends to play with! please keep your money or buy another game that deserves
0;Grand Theft auto Series use to be my greatest joy and pastime sadly these days i just get angry every time i try to play between the non stop drops when playing with friends because their servers suck and the rediculous forcement of having to buy their shark cards to ever get anything in this game its Trash and i dont ever recommend it. If i wanted a pay to play game id just go back to Archeage and suffer that.
0;Games are good games. But it is always wrong to prohibit the player's account. The player who gave money didn't get the game he wanted to play. 17 times the wrong seal. It was banned once in March 23rd this year. The online account in my game is permanently blocked. Is my account two times wrong? Very interesting Let green players quit the game right? Is the plug in player online? Rock stars are really good and good. I won't buy gta6. After all the rock star company's product.
0;"""Almost 600 hours of playing mainly GTA Online and I gotta tell ya the fact that Take Two decided to outright ban modding in any way shape or form...that's not leaving a very good taste in my mouth. I'm talking about single player mods being totally banned online modding is rampant and totally destructive.I've always supported Rockstar but this was the final nail in the coffin. Sometimes pressing the """"Self Destruct"""" button isn't always the best way to solve your problems..."""
0;Rockstar removed ALL my legit 30 million when a modder drops 50k money on my head and now i have 100k left making the game unenjoyable since everything is so overpriced with all those Dlcs a $100 Shark card could only get u a few things in game and not enough for one GOLDEN plane which cost 10mil.Maybe making things less overpriced might reduce the amount of people taking false money ingame.GTA Online use to be good...
0;Welp this game has only best campaign but very Online. and by online is I mean it's all the cars planes boats u want to buy is all in overpriced cause it takes you goddamn weeks to get one at least. Campaign is only the great part of the game then Rockstar got so greedy they added Shark card etc. and who is gonna buy this honestly. Some of the players will hack tbh because how greedy developers are.
0;Im sad that this game with so many dedicated players got shafted by Take 2 after so mush dedication went into the entire community to expand the game in the single player perspective hopefully they can take down cheaters aswell in the multiplayer environment with this sudden change of heart. otherwise its just like they took a big fat dump on the community and flipped them off.
0;So they ed with the #1 utility to make mods. They said it was because of hackers abusing this modding tool in GTA Online. Barring the fact that OpenIV didn't affect multiplayer... Where do they get off pretending they ever cared about hackers in Online???Ok game bad unregulated and unbalanced online mode and modding is now essentially illegal. God help anyone who got this game on PC just so they could mod it.
0;Steam started out as a great platform for this game but the hacking is rampant. It has gotten to the point where you can enter an online session and have your game data hacked so that every time you join a new session you blow up or have 100 body doubles on top of your own. It's just not an enjoyable game when there are constantly people flying around in jets the size of the largest skyscraper. It's just not a good game anymore. 3/10
0;"500+ hours since the beta here's how it goes PUBG lauched incredibly well it was new it was early access and made a sh*t ton of money. We all thinked that with the money Bluehole would hire people to fix and optimize the game. Instead they brought loot boxes/microtransactions. Now they started something called ""Fix PUBG"" based on their reports in there we get 4 more fps since it started ""4"". They're greedy and useless."
0;They raised the price so it would look like there was a discount during the summer sale. Hackers run rampant in online mode. I got a 1 week cooldown for glitching money into the game whereas the people who actually hack do not get any penalty (Soure My friend hacks on GTA Online every day and nothing is done to his account)
0;step 1. Becomes a money bringing out shark cards step 2. do patches that break the money system that forces you to spend your life on the game or buy money with IRL cashstep 3. get kids to get you millionsstep 4. get greedy step 5. ban modsstep 6. ruin your own game gg nice one lads
0;Used to be an OKAY game but now it's complete trash. Modders running amok in every single lobby you get disconnected from sessions left and right. Can't even finish a simple MC mission without myself or one of my friends being dropped from the session 1/10 gg Rockstar.
0;Had hopes of one day modding in VR support for this game for a future playthough. Those dreams have been destroyed with single player mods being a bannable offense now. No point. Don't buy this game unless they decide to let people play a game like it's a game.
0;EDIT Yup been banned again falsely. Definitely don't waste your time with Online.TL DRSingle player is great great character development missions heists etc.Online is just awful too many modders innocent players getting banned (including myself)Would recommend if you like the single player campaign but avoid Online at all costs.
0;Tons of users banned for no reason at all. Banned mods. Literally destroyed the community to just please the console kids who pay to get in game $$$$... .. .../ /) ... .

0;1. Refused to develop single player content post launch.2. Claims to be in favor of single player modding the sole source of user created post launch single player content.3. GTA V Online (PC) was a hackfest that Rockstar did little in the way to correct for years. Causing the online community to drop off sharply.4. New Online DLC comes out for a five year old game and now they're shutting down Single Player Modding?Suck it TakeTwo.
0;Someone should file a lawsuit against Rockstar Games as they ban people from accessing their Online session in some cases when the player has not violated any rules. And after they ban you they wan't you to re purchase the game again for 30 60$ so that they make more money. It is not fair to the people who has to maybe work really hard to buy this game. I am writing this as I am as well banned for no particular reason.
0;Good game but if your internet is anywhere near sub par then doing any other activity that involves internet usage is impossible. Often things fail to render properly which can be horrific if you are flying anything. Would not recommend unless your pc and internet is perfect.
0;First I couldn't even get the damn game to work on my PC due to this game being unoptimized trash. How i even managed to get 200+ hours in this unoptimized trash shocks me. When I did for a short period of time progressing in GTA online is a of a grind and not a fun one to say the least because playing with randoms isn't fun in this game. And to add insult to injury now with Take Two's cokehead executives going against mods now what's the point in going back now?
0;Only things you do in this game make money buy nice car make more money tune nice car make more money and sell last nice car buy nicer car make more money to tune nicer car make money to repair nicer car because some 6 years old kid that stole his mom's card and bought 200 shark cards of 10 million dollars started to spam the s***t out of the space laser on you.I don't recommend this game becuase is purely PAY 2 WIN each and every update is more and more expensive that the last one.
0;It was concerning enough on release that players could and did get banned if they attempted multiplayer with any mods installed. In light of recent events it's obvious Take Two and Rockstar just want to monetize everything at the expense of the players. Don't buy this. Just go play San Andreas again. Don't support this greedy behavior by Take Two and Rockstar.
0;Product received for free. They screwed up the Jester Classic. Im disappointed Rockstar. Who the is in the 3D modeling department. How did you up my Jester Rockstar... YOU!!!!! Ok they fixed the jester but im still not happy with how they stole ideas from mod creators for the Fixed Jester Classic on GTA 5 Mods website.
0;The online part of this game has ruined what could have been amazing. Want to do anything fun? You need money. Want to earn money in game? Prepare to have no time left. It's actually more efficient to get a real part time job to pay for shark cards. This game has become more of a grind than most jobs. Single player is good. Get it in a sale.
0;only giving this game a negative review because of Rockstar's banning issues. I was unexplicably banned for a month and not given any answers. I've never cheated and filed multiple tickets to no avail. This isnt an isolated incident either do some research and you'll find it's happening to more and more people.
0;Interesting story but buried under a horrific slog of grinding repetitive side missions pointless side activities and incredibly fragile cinematic main missions. Watch a movie version or Let's Play on youtube you'll have the best experience. The Online isn't worth it either unless you like grinding even harder to unlock the Heists and have three friends to do them with or want to pay to do them immediately.
0;I have bought this game to play with a friend mostly.I have never modded the game or harrassed anyone it was just a pastime to waste some time with my friend. I was banned wasn't told the reason why and apparently Rokcstar think they can do no wrong since you cannot appeal bans.You are at risk of throwing your money away if you buy this game.
0;Rockstar will ban you for having fun and not buying shark cards. Also the word rockstar is censored online among many other words like and even though this is an M rated game and worse things are said by pedestrians every 30 seconds.edit august 27 2017 Ten million dollars removed for no reason that was all legitimate money. i'm now left with 40k right before a giant expensive update. Support keeps giving me copy pasted responses that are of no help. Not pleased.
0;Until they fix the abhorant banning system this isn't a game anybody should willingly play.I was playing with someone doing MC work and they got banned.However I watch people standing on Mount Chilliad gaining 400 levels within an instant but no issues at all.It's ing disgusting.
0;I purchased this game a while ago and only played single player. I thought it was a great game. I will not be playing multiplayer until microtransactions are removed completely. I believe that anyone should not play any game the has microtransactions and just boycott them all. There are still a few good games left that do not have them. Just don't support them and they will go away. They will have no choice.Do not buy this game if you have not yet.
0;"""For a long while I've belived the game reeks of cash grab so to play nicely I never left a review. Now I know for sure. Once you go after modders you're going after the fans. I already feel milked for my investment but like all other big game companies it's become a take. Pay full price (originally) for a AAA game only to have certain aspects of the game (online) locked behind paywalls and """"sharkcards""""? Just another developer I wont be buying from in the future."""
0;One of there selling points is a open world game that you can do what ever you want. Thanks take two for taking that away. OPEN IV IS FOR SINGLE PLAYER ONLY! Single player mods is what made this game series great not online. On behalf of everyone that used mods for single player use only YOU Rockstar and Take Two!

0;Take Two Interactive is a bunch of incompetent bufoons and I cannot in good conscience recommend any game that involves them.Take Two uses predatory tactics to deal with their community.Someone's hacking in the same lobby as you are? You're getting banned.Wanna make mods for their game? Cease and dessist fool.
0;Game Has an Absolutely Terrible Anti Cheat System. Played the game for the first time in over a month for about 2 hours doing some Bunker missions with a friend for about 2 to 3 hours. I log out for a bit to grab some food do some homework and then log back in later to find my account randomly suspended till June 4 2018 and that all my character data will be erased.
0;GTA V is a great game. With a great community. And a *terrible* company. A company that destroys on the community that keeps it going and keeps it in the black. A company that destroys modding tools which are one of the things that made this game great. Don't buy it.
0;Piece of garbage worked just fine last weekend and now when i go to play it the launcher crashesGood game but rockstar needs to get there crap togetherEDIT it works fine for me again but now i hear there banning people for modding!!! what crap its the whole reason i got the game
0;dont bother buying this game...Rock Star will banned you after a while even when there is proof from them that you have done nothing wrong / or no illegal actavities as been found but due to their T&amp C you remain banned for the rest of your life unless you go and spend another few hundrew bucks...so i give it a minus 9.99 out of 10.
0;Have serious lagging issues. It's almost impossible to even drive a car without lagging every other frame. Also no mod support which is one of the main reasons why I bought this game! If I didn't want to mod the appearance of the game I would have just stuck with GTAV for the xbox 360.
0;Grand Theft Auto VThis game's stroy is really really great.But online operating is a messi don't use hack and i don't have hack.but this game banned me online 7 days twice.i hate this game's online operatingwith that reason.i want to question to rockstar gamesbut they always respond over 7 days. Now i hate rockstar games.
0;I got banned for doing nothing wrong i didnt even mod in single player so i dont know why i was banned and i called the owners of the game (RockstarGames) and they said they dont even know why i was banned and i requested a refund from paypal and steam and they both said no. so please do not buy this game it is a scam.
0;The tards called rockstar Grand theft auto V is on sale! with a shark card. Staying at the same price. I know you can do this with the peasants but we are much smarter kind. And i find this offensive You s should put the original game without shark cards on 75% for this t
0;Despite being a great game don't buy this game during the sale if Rockstar are going to raise the price so the people who waited dont get an actual deal this practice is not only bad for the community but bad for the consumer who is only able/ wants to play singleplayer.
0;EDIT Looks like the players won we now have OpenIV back to the general public! DORIGINAL REVIEW Take Two interactive I have one message for you after you shut down OpenIV Go tell your whole team of game creators to themselves.Uninstalling the game until OpenIV is allowed to redistribute their product again.
0;baning for no reasones.. my friends ar starting to get baned one after another and all because of paranoid rockstar for seeing some kind of other programs as hacks.. like discord ubisoft etc.. so if u want to not get baned the only thing u can play is gta.. try not to go in internet or toching any wrong buttons cuz its just like time bomb.. one wrong step and u are fckt..
0;Take Two are clearly just trying to do a money grab. There is no need to block OpenIV with the excuse of 'trying to stop hackers in online'. That's BS. It doesn't stop them. They're trying to sue people instead of actually making a working anti cheat. Don't support this company.
0;Take Two can shove it. I had already decided to never buy one of their games again over a year ago when they actively sought out and banned moderators on modding forums from GTA Online...moderators who had not even developed mods nor used mods in multiplayer. This most recent transgression just further highlights T2's despicable corporate culture. Lads take a note (or two) from Valve's playbook.
0;There's at least one modder on every server because of this there's no point in bothering to try to kill people. It's a good game when people aren't modding when you actually have a decent fight with someone or you do missions or whatever. But Rockstar and Steam both need to be much more vigilant.For this reason i shall not be recommending this game.
0;As others have previously stated the game is great. But with what t we have to put up (raising prices right before a sale constant bugs and glitches even in SP microtransactions that are way too expensive etc.) I believe potential buyers should pass for this one.
0;Sharkcards + No story DLC + Banning players for singleplayer mods + Long load times Cousin lets go bowling instead of playing gta5And now you are sending out cease and desist for mods? Keep red dead redemption 2 on consoles we don't want your trash 2K games on PC.Will not be paying for another 2k or Rockstar game again.
0;There are 2 ways...Way 1 Develop GTA 5Develop Tool ModEarn money by your gameReward Good reviewWay 2 Develop GTA 5Ban a indie Mod ToolEarn money by your gameReward Bad reviewT2 chose the way 2.. then i give them the deserved reward.If they change way i will change reward.
0;Good story line. That's it for the good points. Now for the negatives you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! you Rockstar! That's about it.I recommend that everybody downloads the cracked version of this game instead. Rockstar are money s who can't control hackers on their servers.
0;BANNED FROM THIS STUPID GAME FOR NO ING REASON IVE LOST SO MUCH ING PROGRESS IVE PUT SO MUCH ING TIME INTO MY AND MY FULL PLAY TIME DOESNT ONLY INCLUDE THE STEAM VERSION OF ONLINE I HAVE OVER 200 HOURS OF ONLINE GTS FROM THE DVD VERSIOn AND THERE GOES EVERYTHING ING EVERYTHING! WHY THE . I FEEL LIKE IVE BEEEN SCAMMED THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I WANT MY CHARACTER BACK OR A REFUND.
0;I like it when the red water comes out. Rockstar wants to ban me for singleplayer activity. Sorry I do not wish to grind for hours playing the same missions over and over again just to ease my curiosity and see if those vehicles I cannot keep in a garage is cool or not.
0;Take Two decided to take a massive sh!t on the modding community because they want to funnel people into online so that they'll buy microtransactions.GTA is not GTA without OpenIV mods are what makes GTA great and targeting them because they want people to play online is disgusting. If you still want OpenIV you can pirate that sh!t.
0;This game is crap dont waste your money on this crap my friend got banned for literaly nothing he had not taken any money from hackers or even had hacks this is just stupid that how he has to restart all the way form the begining of the game. Now multiple months later i got into a game with a hacker and he turned me into a bad sport so now im not able to play with my friends at all. this game is just so bull crap about the way it does things.
0;Take Two Interactive killed the singleplayer modding community in favor of micro transactions. You've lost all of my respect.Take Two Interactive le ha cerrado las puertas a los mods para el singleplayer. Herramientas como OpenIV ahora son ilegales..https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_ok
0;"""Pros Fun singleplayer just like any other GTA gameCons """"Illegal"""" mod policy from publisherMultiplayer public sessions full of cheatersRandom automated non apealable bans for normal players caused by multiplayer hackingLong and useless loading screens in multiplayer when changing gamesShark cards are cash grab"""
0;Singleplayer was phenomenally solid for its time. Just for that it's worth the money.Multiplayer suffers from a constant feature creep and microtransaction fever. Lack of significant endgame content. Repetative missions and side activities. Regardless some good fun was had with friends.
0;Not recommended. Was permabanned for killing non godded modders 3 times. Do not get this game. It is fun with friends but the support is literally just a bot that copies and pastes and their support number staff only read your ticket and say that it's your own fault. Terrible company bad game.
0;Repeat of same dlc for months that is way too over priced and just for money which no one will buy as its just modders keeping the game alive by giving players moeny and this money was taken just for microtransactions to be used again and then mods were taken out of singleplayer. This game will die if it continues how it is.
0;"""Great game way too many """"modders"""" to be appreciable! I just got online after many weeks of being offline because of it decided to try out a plane I own. As soon as I got out of my hangar a guy teleported into my passenger seat. That was maybe 3 minutes online for 15 spent loading thanks Rockstar!!"""
0;They have completely disabled modding in GTA 5 now. They sent the creators of OpenIV the only GTA modding tool of its kind a Ceast and Desist letter to get them to stop distributing the tool. Now we have to abide by Tyrannical Take Two's rules and play the official online mode which is ridden with complete and utter filth and is a grind fest that can't even shake a finger at World of Warcraft. If you still haven't bought this game. Don't. Just pirate it. Don't give these s any more money.
0;"""Product received for free. I really wanted to enjoy GTA Online but like others say it's a mess. You've got the cheating modders loading screens for days expensive items (over $5k for a paper bag mask really?) lobbies where people aren't patient and leave griefers stupid game mechanics can't steal an """"expensive"""" vehicle to own it etc. GG.Single player is fun for a while at least."""
0;As someone who has grown bored with this game modded gameplay was the only thing drawing any of my interest back to it. Killing off the most popular single player modding group which brought you even more players/revenue is short sighted and simply offensive. I do not recommend this game to anyone at this point as it's played out already and I likely won't play it again myself.
0;gta should have been the story mode with GTA online existing as a entirely different entety that was free as it stands its a AAA priced game that requires insande amount of grinding or a massive amount of disposable money. heists are nice with friends though.
0;www.take2games.com destroying people who want make private servers with mods just becuase they need more money becuase they are not rich already. They doesnt care about people who playing GTA V they just care about money money money money... support this website that we get private servers back! https //www.change.org/p/vote for the authorization of the multiplayer mod gta mp for gta v
0;Can't play more than 10 minutes online because they're using a sh***y peer to peer connections on this AAA title which my modem doesn't like. It shows that every player left when i'm dropped from a session.Lots of multiplayer content but it still feels grindy because of the online prices (vehicles and stuff) are high.I didn't use OpenIV however they killed singleplayer modding which was a mistake as well.
0;Rather than actually adressing the issues of the repetitive grind fest and hacker filled mess that is GTA Online Take Two proceeds to shoot themselves in the kneecaps by removing the only thing possibly keeping this dying game afloat that being modding single player modding at that guising it as the reason why GTA Online is full of hackers but really it's just so they can protect their precious shark cards and continue being jews about it.
0;Banning players who receive a ton of money from hackers is like arresting a drug addict but not his supplier. The drug addict just needs help the supplier is the one ruining people s lives. Go after the supplier not the end user if you want these things to stop.I'm glad they finally lifted the modding ban though.
0;Take Two Interactive has ended modding on this game and they recently bought the rights to Kerbal Space Program and will probably do the same to it. Stay far away until modding is given back. GTA Online is boring and you have to grind to get anything or cough up money to buy shark cards. The only reason they enforce anti hacking is so that people can't spawn in money. CEO of Take Two doesn't even play video games.
0;First it was the Shark cards and now T2 isn't allowing mods. Cool.The thing is GTAV and GTAO should have been seperate from the beginning. Not being able to mod single player is hugely disappointing and is the main reason you're under fire dumb s. Good luck T2 you'll need all of it that you can get your grubby hands on.
0;Cannot Even Have Fun In Single Player Instead Of People At T2 Taking Care Of The Community They Try To Push The Limit Of People Untill It's Tooo Late! Rockstar Should Stand Up For It's Community FOR ONCE NOT TO TRY TO MILK US MORE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE!!!! What About The Modding Communities Like LSPDFR????? T2 And R* For Not Standing up for us once again but for the money!
0;Amazing singleplayer that I have probably spent over 100 hours roaming around in with mods Horrible ban happy multiplayer though as this is the only multiplayer game I have been banned in for modding the singleplayer RIP Online character that I had since around 2014.
0;Take Two is a scummy business. I hate it when corporate greed shuts down something good. Meanwhile millions are cheating ONLINE in your games (which you do NOTHING about) and you can't handle people modding a singleplayer portion? Are you kidding me? RIP Rockstar.
0;you rockstar. Even though I'm not much into modding but shutting down Open IV is BS. If you think it'll help you to get rid of cheaters then you're completely wrong because OpenIV does not affect MP it's only for SP. It will only get worse. I also wanted to mention that MP is not worth playing all you have to do is grind(it's quite boring and exhausting) and of course there are lots of cheaters who want to ruin your game experience.
0;Take2 have taken the most t move that's happened in a long time not only is micro transactions littered every where on online its just pay to win t repetitive unoriginal online content and no single player dlc limiting single player to no updates with new vehicles. Well they've now made modding it illegal. t.
0;well as a start. my game worked but the online mod didn't after a while the game itself didnt work eather.no much to say just think twice before you buy somthing in 60 box.and if anybody can tell me how to fix the game/ get refound it will be very helpful.thx.
0;things that i hated when the game just came out Year long loading time cheaters / hackers over priced Online things because of SharkCard Pay2Win systemThey didn't change a thing now. just the fact that they want to destory our modding tools is too much for me.I will still 'try' to play this game but i won't buy any new game from R* or T2
0;Dear head of the Take Two InteractiveFrom the supporters of OpenIV and all of those who have been unfortunate enough to have ever made contact with you.Please find the nearest body of water where you can fit your thick head in and keep it under the water until everything goes blank. I know it will be hard due to how empty that dome of garbage you call a head is but for the love of god Do it for the poor souls who might have to deal with your dumbass in the near future.Sincerely VoodooChille
0;this game was amzing in the past but unfortnately its not now online mode has been overrun my modders and items you cant afford without buying sharkcards at this point it seems like rockstar are milking the game for as much money as they can before it dies very disapointing updates with very very expensive items and the story mode is just the same old story so thats boring as well.i would not reccomend this game to anyone unless rockstar fixes these major issues you will regret it
0;This f*ucking lame game crashed many times. One of which we have 4 remaining players 2 of which are duo. In the middle of 2 vs me this game crashed. Whhyy?? Aside from that we also have some issues with rubber banding not accurate hits and cheaters. This game prioritized crates skins and keys. Clearly they're after the money.
0;The story was fun but offered little more.If you have some friends to play with it is really fun however if you play in a public you will be plauged by modders and greifers that will ensure that it is nearly unplayable accept breifly after major updates. It is also built to promote microtansactions in a game that you already paid for.
0;Finally started playing gta again after the new update had modded money that was spawed on top of me but probz only spent it on upgrades to the new nascar beacuse ive been playing alot of the new racers but once again GTA just d**ks everyone and will probz not be playing this game again. Keep up the great work Rockstar
0;dont buy this game if you are on budget talking about gta online it is full of hacker and it is hard to connect to any game mode and i got banned 3 times (the last ban was permanent) for no reasons lol i didnt use any kind of cheats or hacks or glitches ty rockstar for banning me instead of banning the many hackers in your gameanyway if you want to play the game just downalod the pirated version to play the story because the online is and it just becomes worse every update they release
0;I really want to like the game single player is awesome but online is unplayable. You can hang around do whatever but it's impossible to do any MC or CEO activities. As soon as you start a mission a modder is going to ruin it for you. Rockstar Games does a really bad job on stopping it. There are modders in 9/10 lobbies at any time of the day. It would be very easy to have a handful of people to monitor this and ban any modder on sight. Can't recommend at all right now.
0;The story mode of this game is great the optimization and gameplay are also great. I can't reccomend this game though. RockStar's awful practices in online multiplayer are unbelievably pathetic. You can spend hundreds of dollars and thousands of hours in this game only to have it all wiped and reset on strike one. The best part? If a hacker decides to... Oh I don't know... drop money on your head YOU get punished for it. Strike two and you're permanently banned with no appeal.
0;Bought several copies of this game spent both hundred of dollars and hours in it with friends only to get banned and my character deleted without any disclosure as to why or ability to explain my side. Buyer beware this game will screw you out of your money without any warning and say it is your fault
0;Since they killed off 65 percent of their playerbase just by stopping anytthing related to OpenIV this game is not recomended due to them destroying some fantastic modders and mods... I truly feel bad for the modders since most of what they worked for is gone... you and burn in hell Take Two. Go to your local gun store buy a glock and kill yourselfs Step on a lego you
0;Modders create economic inflation. They create chaos virtually in every activity you join &amp ruin public servers. Not all of them mod to mess with people but so many people mod that you need a menu to play this game without getting bullied. R* isnt going to do anything about it. What's the point in releasing these new game modes/stunt races when someone with a menu will just teleport everyone into the ocean?
0;"""Pretty okay game had some fun in it.Play the online though and it's obvious how many opportunities were missed in favor of trying to make as much money as possible for little to no effort and now it's extended to outright punishing people trying (in spite of game design ) to play it legitimately.Voting with your wallet is sacrilege in today's """"buy everything"""" world but seriously Skip this. The game isn't worth supporting a business."""
0;Wonderful game...on consoleWould be extremely awesome if the devs would actually take the time to look into peoples game directory before wrongfully banning people.If you want to play gta 5 SP buy this game! However do not waste your money if you plan to play online.
0;I don't understand you release a single player game don't release any single player content so you can nickel and dime people with whale cards in your grindy online mode then you come down on people trying to breathe new life into your game and create single player content for your game all for free?Good way to alienate your fanbase.
0;I understand cracking down on modders online but banning a modding tool that is primarily used for single player mods is the wrong move to go about. I and a lot of people brought this game on PC primarily for modding and now that option is gone this game is of little use in terms of playability in terms of single player content.
0;Not everyone likes multiplayer. So aside from the distinct LACK of singleplayer content the debacle of screwing over the SP modding community is basically the final straw. You want a good fast paced huge open world third person shooter? BUY JUST CAUSE 3. It also has a hookshot which makes gameplay more fun.
0;1st is the Updates and The ban system they literally ban random players who think they cheated while playing online 2nd they are freaking greedy with their In game vehicles Weapons Homes cost alot of money that encourages other player gonna buy sharkcards....Yousonofa !3rd they close the OpenIV source code from modders for what? To prevent them to improve the game of course and more money was in this game.
0;i was doing heist and mission with my friends after that i was going to buy some dress. i bought same pants twice and i got banned 10 days i ask them why have i been banned ? they told me u're using glitch cheat modding. actually i didnt use any glitch cheat mod. they can investigate my account but they didnt. i told it to them but they didnt recognized me so dont buy this game its so suck . they cant interested be in about the game.
0;Take two and rockstar have done nothing but us all since release. Banned me off online even thought i was only on my first warning now the game is essentially useless to me. And on top of that there trying to take down OpenIV. Never buying anything from these frauds again...
0;I don't understand where it was a good idea to remove a key mod to the community. Look at Bethesda. How long has skyrim lasted? Think about how long that game has lasted. The reason? Mods. In other words your decision was not intelligent in the slightest. Enjoy the reviews and loss of community. You should be working on stopping all the hackers instead.
0;"""I'm leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team. OpenIV is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE ammount of mods for Gta V and Gta IV. Basically modding is """"illegal"""" so I am leaving this negative review. The game is okay but this """"No Modding Policy"""" is ridiculous and I will not stand for it."""
0;Filled with microtransactions and hackers... hmm are those two words connected? Don't buy also Take Two Interactive decided to bully not developers to stop developing mods that ultimately make the game more enjoyable. I'm glad to know the devs have our best interest at heart. Bottom line Don't support a garbage company. Want a good game? Bethesda is a good place to start.
0;Love the GTA series I've played almost all of them since I got a console. I bought GTA V for pc for the modding potential but with the recent news regarding OpenIV and how modding is basically dead I can't recommend it. Honestly if you're planning on getting GTA V then I would recommend waiting until Take Two Interactive stops ****ing over modders because what they did is unreasonable and honestly completely unforgivable.
0;Take Two says that they need to monetize more.The first thing they do is to destroy one of the selling points of the games they own. Well done. Well f*cking done there. Enjoy watching your ratings plummet.I was looking forward to Red Dead 2. Won't be buying it now.You need to learn some humility Take Two.
0;Wrongfully banned from online play years ago for someone forcefully dropping money on my player (I assume this is why)The game is just a cash grab at this point every update takes months to be fully released and is full of useless content that costs a ridiculous amount of in game money to buy forcing players to buy shark cards or resort to cheating.
0;gta 5 online just wont ing loadi played the story mode that is fine but the ing online mode wint let me ini asked for a refund and they are like u have exceded 2 hr of game playi spent 30 min on story mode and the rest 2.30 hr was just ing loading screen for gta onlineim so frustrated with this
0;Mods are back but guess what? I won't be buying the next Rockstar game. Skyrim SE a 64 bit version of an almost 6 year old game is in the top sellers list for a reason pay attention. You have shown that all you care about is money when trying to stop modding and you poo'd on the fanbase. My $$$ goes elsewere from now on.
0;The game was fun when it came out but now its just a money grab with every new addition to the game costing more money. The worst part is that every online session you connect to has a 12 year old with got mode that just sits around trying to kill you.
0;Well you just screwed your revenue. Good job take two and rockstar you got rid of the #2 reason people bought this game.Modders and Open IV were peaceful and stuck to single player. The Modding Community didn't even contribute to hacking. Open 4 prohibited you from launching online.It was great until nowGTA 5 is extremely limited without the moding community.I hope you learn from this.
0;"""probably the worst community of players of any game. I don't mean """"oh people kill you because its GTA"""". no most lobbies you will be in online are full of truly toxic people. a waste of money if you do not have a group of friends you plan to play with. toxic toxic cancer causing jerks."""
0;"""Whats that? Do I see damage control from TakeMyMoney? Theyre allowing mods again? How nice of them still... people wont forget this """"Apparently they werent milking the Online mode enough so they just shuted down every single mod for GTA V. Well played TakeMyMoney.""""Game is great publishers are awful"""
0;The single player experience is not what I bought this for.So my review cannot apply to that aspect.I love this game and have poured tons of money and time into playing the multiplayer online experience.Bottom LineThey took 1.7 million dollars of legit money from a friend I grinded it with.I hear that people have gotten their money back but those are special cases.
0;Rockstar makes everything 30 times what it should cost and does not provide any legitimate way to make enough money to buy the dlc. Then rockstar blames modderd for modding when in actuallity modding would not be nearly as much of a problem if one could legitimately make enough money to buy all the fun things in the game. Never NEVER buy this game. it is just a greedy excuse for an online game.
0;Its a grindfest/ pay to win now. Wallet warriors run and it takes literally weeks to buy some of the more expensive stuff. Cool if you have friends to play with but get REAL boring REAL quick with solo play. Because of the success of shark cards we will never get another solid GTA without pay to win options.
0;Modding makes Grand Theft Auto fun after you finish the story and get tired of the repeditive grinding that is online (or you must buy Shark Cards). And since they ed the modding community by stopping OpenIV I would not advice to buy this game. Oh and before I forget. you Take Two. Greedy Edit yes. We won. Modding and openIV are now allowed again and I would recommend this game again. I will not remove this review as a reminder for them.
0;Mods are the only reason most people buy this game on PC and attempting to remove that is the worst idea you could have but I guess the $60 everyone paid for this game that is the 3rd best selling game of all time wasnt enough and the microtransaction hell hole that is multiplayer isnt making enough. So you have to make the singleplayer as as possible by not including features like the hydra and then make mods not work just so people play the multiplayer and pay you money.
0;Screw you for banning my online account I'm already mad enough with that. Right now you wanna bann offline mods?! WHAT THE IS WRONG WITH YOU GTA survived thank to the modding community and mods are the main attraction to people who are interested to play with. There are soo many hackers online all thanks to your overpriced dlc things and sky is the limit sharkcards price it's all your fault causing hackers to appear online. YOU.
0;if you're gonna buy the game for the single player exprience then go ahead single player is amazing and worth the 60 dollars.Online is terrible hackers tryhards overpirced...well everything.Yea maybe its fun with a group a friends but even then its eh
0;There's nothing wrong with the game itself and its actually a good game when the developers aren't actively trying to you and ruin any possible fun you could have which they do ALL THE TIME EVEN BEFORE THIS OPEN IV TRAINWRECKno wonder people are fed up with this garbage
0;Take two interactive has offically made modding this game illegal. If you can't mod a game then what's the point. Also GTA Online sucks anyways. Thank god I got this stupid game at a discount. Sorry take two. You holes are money hungry bastards who diserve nothing from me. Go yourselfs royally. It's a good game but it gets very boring fast. If you are going to buy this game buy it at an EXTREME discount. It's not worth $60. This game is only worth $20 now if that.
0;At this point in the game it is not worth it to get into. There are generally too many hackers which can get extremely tiresome. Along with that it will take an exceptionally long time to obtain the late game items especially with the recent updates. As in it can take easily 50mil for everything from the recent updates at minimum.
0;ohboytimetoboycottLook GTA V (The Singleplayer) is a great game made by talented people. But now they've killed modding the main reason many people who already had a console copy of the game buy the PC Version.I would not suggest giving Take Two any money at this point until they resolve this.(Context http //openiv.com/?p 1324)
0;I have been suspended for 1 month with no reason i didn't violate any eula policies nor used mods. and my characters in online would go undergo a reset. Rockstar would you mind helping me out in this situation? any reply would be appreciated.Thank you very much.
0;I'm gonna have to hit this with a negative rating. I loved the story but online is so tedious and time consuming with very little reward. After the Gunrunning update rockstar randomly took seven million out of my bank account even though I busted my for that cash. I'm getting older and I don't have time to play a 10 minute misson to only get around 20k out of it. I guess they really captured how expensive LA really is. Also TakeTwo.
0;Pros Single Player is a lot fun so I do Recommend Single Player All three Protaganists are really great. Graphics Draw distance Map size truly amazing So much to do. Cons Loading Screens for Online take forever and fail a lot of the time. The GTA V Online community is comprised of trolls hackers and idiots. The Grind is NOT worth it hence Shark Cards for more RL $$$.
0;so many cheater in online game immortal and invisible man so I really mad about this..so if u (GTA 5) wanted life longer please fix this bugs....!!!!!!!!and I cannot play with my friend in the online game when I start the mission at the club my friend was left always happen.and I get boring about this..!!
0;No Single Player support of any kind.Take Two Interactive and their Subsiderary Rockstar Games have banned ALL modding including single player no doubt in an attempt to drive any remaining solo players to the Online mode where they have to either grind for eternity or buy countless sharkcards.This is nothing but a move for them to capitalise more on players. Which is no surprise following the head of Take Two Interactive's recent comments claiming they were undermonitising users.
0;If you're buying it for single player thats fine online part however filled with modders way too high prices to buy anything it's grinding the heists over and over again until you have enough money to buy a house or a car but by that time you're going to get bored because no other activity or mission provides enough money to buy anything and you're stuck doing heists over and over again.
0;I play this game game primarily for single player specifically to mod it. Take Two has essentially said that modding is illegal. For that they can go themselves. Don't buy this game. Don't support Rockstar or Take Two if you have any kind of integrity going forward I know I won't. Enjoy your millions of dollars Take Two. Don't expect to get that kind of money from PC gamers again.
0;Slow to load. Multiplayer is meh purposely designed to push players towards putting more money into it. Harsh on the good kinds of modders and don't seem to give a about the hackers that ruin the game for everyone. It's fun but I'm slowly becoming more and more dissapointed with the direction that the developers are taking this in.
0;Okay lets get started here. First thing i want to go over is that my computer reaches the reccomended specs. This game is fun and all regarding the hackers or modders i simply can't like this game for the fact it crashes way to much. Everything is fine except the connection issuses crashing hackers. If you can live with those things and have fun with them then sure go ahead and buy the game. But purely i find this game very fun when i don't crash or anything like that.
0;REVIEW FOR THE ONLINE VERSION What the actual happened with this game. After a one year break I tried playing some online with my friends. We spent over one hour trying just to join THE SAME LOBBY WITHOUT ONE OF US DISCONNECTING. And this was not our fault the game kept disconnecting us until we gave up and came here writing this review. Eat my rosckstar games.
0;"""I've played GTA V for countless hours on Xbox 360 and transfered to PC later after reaching rank 100. One month later I get suspended and my account was reset and the reason given was that I """"cheated"""". I have never modded or cheated before so this really shows how bad their system is."""
0;Once again Rockstar does an outstanding job with their update. I especially love the fact that they banned modding EVEN IN SINGLEPLAYER!!!! Oh and the fact that they took away so many peoples legit money (8m to 40k overnight) and that the economy is so inflated because of the modders that is almost essential to mod now. FFS it cost 3.5m for a motorcycle now...
0;I bought this game with the intention of modding it just like I did with GTA IV but with Take 2 gutting that I no longer wish to play. Online is a cheater infested pile of crap and you need one to get anywhere without spending stupid amounts of money on shark cards which is a waster of money. Screw you Take 2. Modifying Single Player hurts nothing but your profits which clearly shouldn't matter because you've sold more than 75 million copies.
0;Single player is good but Take Two who own Rockstar have turned the Online mode into a cash shop mess with grinding for overpowered armoured cars and fighter jets and the money earned playing the game losing value so you have to buy shark cards instead. Take Two now have sent a Cease &amp Desist order to modders basically ruining the modding scene and making the game unmoddable. Take Two took a gaming classic and ruined it for money.
0;Screw Take Two etc. Why even bother making a single player game if you don't release single player content like you said you would and instead entirely focus your resources on milking the hell out of GTA O? Which hackers still run rampant in?Take Two is the new EA. Let that sink in for a second.
0;Rampant hacking and cheating in online play wich Rockstar does nothing about. Modders duplicate cars and spawn in infinite amounts of money as well as having control over the game world. On an official rockstar lobby you can be minding your own business playing and suddenly you are removed from your car and frozen so you can't move/shoot etc or have your character transformed into a giant block of concrete or spontaneously lit on fire... And there is nothing you can do about it.
0;What the hell is wrong with mods recently?! I feel like all the big devs have jsut noticed this cake that has been sitting there and has either thought 'Gonna get me some of dat!' or 'This cake has been around for some time! It has be very dirty! We shall get rid of it!' off Take two
0;T2 is a greedy company that doesn't care about the happiness of its costumers rather how much money they can ing make. I highly recommended this game but if you're going to mod DON'T BUY IT T2 is ing money hungry. OPEN IV deserves to stay T2 deserves to go
0;Despite my hours I have on this game and the fun times I have had and as much as I like supporting Rockstar I cannot and will not support Take Two Interactive any further with their decision to shutdown OpenIV. Hope you rot in hell you greedy corporate bastards.
0;I enjoyed this game for a few years now but now that about 70% of the mods dont exist I do not recommend it for players that finish the story line or own it on another platform. This is a clasic example of a company trying to limit the end user experence and forcing them to purchace future DLC to continue enjoying the game.
0;Until Rockstar launches a legitimate anti cheat I do not recommend this game to those wishing to have fun online. It is a pain to get a lobby with no money hackers or just straight up a holes. The singleplayer is pretty fun and a good time waster before work.
0;Modding is one of the strongest pillars of the PC community in almost any game. The time and effort that people spent creating their own content for the single player version of this game have gone completely to waste. These individuals did nothing but help your game receive further sales and helped us to get more enjoyment out of the game. I will refuse to give any more money to any game company that refuses to embrace harmless player mods on PC.
0;I had 6 million dollars fair gotten but in the next update rockstar decieded to remove all my ing money !!! dont buy you will spend alot of time and then going to get ed over by rockstar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not even talking about it crashing every mission i try to play and before you say upgrade your pc . i have a high end 6000$ pc
0;Take Two they just ruined GTA V......................./ /).................... / ../.................../..../............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...&amp apos......... .................'...../..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............(.............. ............. ...
0;"""""""Take Two"""" (GTA Online devs) essentially banned modding for this game while I never modded GTA5 something like """"paid mods"""" cough Bethesda shouldn't be supported...UPDATE I guess they backed off a little but sounds like they can still sue modders if they wanted..."""
0;RIP MODS glad to see that mabey GTA 5 wont be in the Top Ten Charts for once as the deserve to never be again just ridiculous i hope some people get fired for this we the community are not happy lets make sure we show it and make them come crawling back on there knees begging for our business BACK
0;I originally bought this version of GTA to mod singleplayer. And that ONLY. Not to cheat in online. So now that openiv has been shutdown I really have no point in playing this anymore. Thanks T2 for wasting my time and money.P.S. I'd rather be able to pay my bills than have an ingame object. Thanks.
0;Been playing GTA since 2007 always enjoyed modding especially in GTA IV and GTA SA now Take Two has shut down OpenIV and ruined alot of potentially good mods that would keep the single player in GTA V alive as Rockstar doesn't seem to want to release a SP DLC anytime soon because of Online.
0;After three years of playing the most recent title from our friends at Rockstar games with great regret i would not advise buying this game. Not because of any problems within the game or anything related to the game. but it's because of the recent C&amp D against OpenIV a modding tool for GTAV &amp GTAIV. i enjoy this game along with millions of others across many platforms but this has truly soured my thoughts on Take Two and Rockstar.
0;I didn't pay for this game with my hard earned money to play only what you wish.. Multiplayer. It's painfully obvious from Rockstar and Take Two that you are blatantly dishonest with your actions against OpenIV. No attempt to even contact the OpenIV team! I bought this game for the mod support it offers. Very greedy and unprofessional.
0;Take two has essentially killed the entire modding community. GTA V has a great singleplayer but without mods there is simply no replayibility to it. They are forcing players onto GTA online to milk more money from them through microtransactions and shark cards. If something isn't done about this you can expect this to be the downfall of GTA. Sad to see such a great game fall apart.
0;Take Two ruined it now that they took down OpenIV. No more modding which is one of the biggest GTA communities. Do not recommend now that they are basically pushing you into microtransactions and making the game pay to win. If they allow OpenIV then I would recommend it.
0;As of now Rockstar and Take Two have done everything possible to ensure that I will never buy another game from them again! The way they treat their community is awful and shows once and for all that they care for nothing more than to just continue milking GTAO. Willing to bet their in the process of making paid mods of thier own with Bethesda and Microsoft hot on the scene.I do NOT recommend buying ANY Rockstar/Taketwo product EVER.
0;Product received for free. As a lifelong GTA fan with thousands of hours in each title it pains me to say Take Two can shove it for sending a C&amp D to OpenIV developers. We the community have made this franchise what it is today not only you Take Two. OpenIV may be gone but we're still here and OpenIV 2 is on the way.
0;"""About a month or two ago I probably would have been writing a positive review for this. But now? I honestly can't support Take Two or Rockstar anymore. Not only did they send the cease and desist to OpenIV but they also """"adjusted"""" the accounts of my friends and I causing us to lose two to four million each of legitimate cash. All because a modder gave them maybe 600k."""
0;Take Two's cease and desist on OpenIV is a blantant attack on the modding community and gamers. Modders keep games alive and it is a cornerstone in the gaming community. I cannot support Rockstar or Take Two because they clearly do not support gamers.
0;Done just done. As if it's not bad enough that R* games feel PC is an atrocity that doesn't deserve their games and any kind of proper story expansion will never happen thanks to the cash cow of GTA Online now Take Two decided to basically ban modding.Just... to hell with this game and it's makers/publishers.
0;The singleplayer is fine a great GTA game but this openIV mod stuff just made it's single player a bit worse. On the mulitplayer front the gameplay is fun but the grind is insane and the 'micro' transcations cost enough for you to be better off buying a real house instead of getting some ingame money.
0;I bought this game three times one for previous generationone for THIS gen and the PC version for Modding and generally having fun in single playerand they do this as a show of gratitude?? you Take Two... you can take a number 2 on yourself and any future products you release...
0;How to GTA Online fun game doing stupid stuff with friends poorfag.jpeg doing hours of jobs to earn cash cuz shark cards is finally enough money to buy fun stuff hacker in server doing hacker stuff giving us ufo's as hats and lollygags leaves server cuz dont wanna get banned logs on next day all money gone from bank rockstar took it all creates ticket on legendary support site gets standard generated answer back hidden answer saying to myself5/7
0;Single Player great Multiplayer flooded with microtransactions everything is exspencive and take weeks of grinding just to buy a house. Lets hope RDR2 is not like this if so then #boycotttake2games Also to add T2I killed single player modding so the fun has died.
0;If you think punishing your single player fanbase by putting a stop to a decade of modding is going to clean the cheaters out of your money hungry Online component you're even more out of touch than this move makes you look.And if it's because paid mods are back in the spotlight and you're doing this until you figure out how you can take a slice you should take a look at how paid mods were received in the past.
0;Shark cards have ruined this game idiots that bought them should fall on a sword. It is almost impossible to make money in game becasue they want you to buy the money via shark cards and when the community finds a way to make money rockstar patches the game to stop you. A friends account was ban for no reason other than useing a flying car mod in a invite only session literally gone had to buy a new copy. what he heck rockstar jsut make a cheaters only room dont take the game from us.
0;Good game ruined by corporate greed. I've hated what Take Two has done to this game even before the OpenIV dilemma. LETS ADD A ON OF THINGS TO SPEND MONEY ON BUT NO WAYS TO EARN MONEY EFFICIENTLY BESIDES SHARK CARDS. Turned Online into a cash grabbing disgrace. I genuinely fear for Red Dead Redemption 2 because the same morons are in charge. Don't support these s. I'm glad I didn't spend a cent on their stupid shark cards.
0;Take Two and Rockstar greed will not prevail on this platform.Much love for the hard work and dedication of the OpenIV team throughout the years. Although I have never personally used your tool I support you because you created it out of love for these games.
0;GTA V for the most part is a good game. But a few poor design and business choices make the single player experience seem incomplete and the online mode downright frustrating. I keep coming back to this game expecting something more but the daily grind of GTA Online just isn't satisfying and the story is still plagued by bugs reported back in 2013.My advice is buy one of its competitors because despite this game's colossal budget and success it still can't provide a complete experience.
0;This is now going to become a boycott against this product because of Take two interactive cutting off almost all mods so 'em if you wanted to buy this game DONT DO IT not until they fix what needs to be fixed and cutting off mods from SINGLE PLAYER yes you read right SINGLE PLAYER is not going to fix the game.
0;With the cheats this game has installing mods was arguably the way to go. It made the singleplayer much less tedious and much more fun. I'm sad (and mad) to see that Take Two has decided to strike out against something that has enabled gamers to play this series the way they want for nearly ten years. Though I love this game for how it plays I can't support this decision. It's not the same without mods.
0;Take Two's stance on fan created content that contributed to the game as well as their obsession with squeezing every penny out of the customer's pockets through microtransactions leads me to say that this game is not recommended. Play it if you have it already but if you don't don't buy it and sure as HECK don't buy any microtransactions. It isn't worth it.
0;While this game has had a very long lifespan its lack of innovation and focus on extracting cash from your wallet makes me not reccomend this game at this point. Furthermore the publisher is very paranoid about mod usuage but has done nothing of substance to limit the rampant cheating online.
0;Today someone raised the rank of all the players on the session i was playing (48 to 466 in my case) .I've opened a request to Rockstar to revert my account to my former state. I won't play untill this is sorted .This review will remain negative untill then.
0;"""To be serious the story mode is playableThe online mode is full of hackers and people who bought an """"unlock all""""An Unlock all is an account which has extremly high money you can buy this with 10 .However pretty much all people use some jets or other high cost things to kill new guys.If you want to play something in which you don't have spended 500 frustrating hours of playing and get killed only then this is definetly not the game you want to play."""
0;Do not ing buy this as fun as the single player is you should not be giving money to those scumbags at Take two. For those unaware take two (whow own rockstar) have filed a cease &amp desist on open iv the mod that makes it possible to do the crazy most mods do. Whowever is reading this most likely would be buying this game for the mods yet take two feel the need to be unlikeable .
0;"""I used to recommend this game. But now that the modding is gone there's no point anymore. Unless you have a few hundred to spend on Shark cards or plan on spending all your free time playing to try to be a pro player the online is pointless. It's a bunch of kids who have nothing else to do than kill everyone else and spend all their parent's money to """"be better than everyone""""."""
0;rockstar resently corrected my account money by 900.000 $. i didnt do any glitch or abuse. i didnt meet any modder or took any cheated money. so no i do not recommend this game because over the world rockstar deleted billions of hours of ingame work.thx....
0;How to kill gta step 1. Add gunrunning with its explosive snipers.step 2. Add Smugglers run with its ridiculously overpowered planes that can devastate people on the ground because rockets cant catch up to planes and the new planes have flares if the rockets somehow get close to them.step 3. Profit because everyone buys shark cards now.Still gonna play it tho
0;First lobby I entered after the OpenIv ban still had cheaters in it. (two to be exact) +1 for off the entire community while doing nothing to secure your game. GTAV online is easier to hack than the DNC.edit Guess they are backing off of OpenIv which is good but it's still pay/cheat to win.
0;Due to the fact Take Two have issued a cease and desist message to the 10 year old OPEN IV modding tool I am downvoting GTA V and I urge others to do the same. The modding community have always thrived in GTA games but this just goes without saying that without OPEN IV the rest of the Mod creators future work and current work will now be made irrelevant. Strauss Zelnick and Take Two have crossed a line.
0;Product received for free. I did a doomsday heist and did not get the cash money. That wasn't very cash money of you rockstar I lost 760K I took a Phat L on this oneI tried to do Act 3 but now it just says Rockstar services are unavaliable cucked part 2 electric boogalooValidated my files and nothing works so spent 120K on the setup just for it to say services are unavaliable Cucked by RockstarPHAT L
0;With the amount of flaws that this game has it is quite shocking that this is infact the most anticipated title of all time.Hell had neither the series been so god damn famous or had this game not been bearing the title of GTA then no way in hell could Rockstarever have gotten away with something like this.
0;Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games just destroyed the game that i put hunderts of hours with a poorly written statement. Don't expect no sympathy from me anymore. I will never buy any of your games anymore no matter how beautiful it is. #boycottRdR2
0;From June 2017 if you wish to play this game with mods which in my opinon made GTA so big on the PC platform than don't even. The tools used to give the consumer such vast amount of freedom and fun in singleplayer have now been taken down by take two the owners of rockstar thus making this game pointless and un recommendable.
0;I literally only bought this ing game because of the LSPDFR mod. I may as well shut my goddamn Twitch channel down now because that mod accounted for 90% of my freaking content. I honestly hope Take Two burns in hell for this. I'm at least glad I didn't buy KSP and only have the demo. It's like this that makes people pirate games. Absolutely ridiculous. Take Two go yourselves.
0;OpenIV gets a cease and desist so there goes moddingGameplay is very lacking in comparison to GTA 4Online is filled with loading screens a broken party system and cheaters.No singleplayer DLC and a lack of multiplayer content onlineOverall 4 beats 5 any day of the week
0;Grand theft auto has long been one of my favorate games but the attack on OpenIV (modding platform which allows us to make singleplayer how we enjoy it) has led me to not recommend this game. I bought this game on PC to play things like LSPDFR and mod it. This game's the perfect platform for it but this uncalled for attack of the modding community and anti consumerism is just sad. Remove the Cease and Desist letter for your own good and the communities or your going to lose a huge fanbase.
0;Modding is dead but hey at least you can go online for the promise of meeting hackers who will reset all of your legitimate progress while escaping scott free participate in an activity you hate but have few alternatives to if you want to make any 'real' money or when you get tired of either of those give Take Two even more real real money on top of what you paid for this game.It's Rockstar certified satire come to life like never before.
0;your online content sucks and the game is dying because of hackers. So how about you fix that before ing up the only thing this game is good for .. the story and the mods. By the way you guys for not updating the single player with weapons and vehicles from multiplay. seems like something simple to do.
0;Singleplayer is good. But the game shouldn't be so expensive this many years after release and the multiplayer is irredemably . Throw that with the fact that there's no singleplayer dlc and take2 just killed the modding scene I don't recommend this game.
0;They pulled the plug on modding 10 years into it which is extremely not cool. I only played the game with mods. If I had known the extent of the countless moneygrabbing DLC's and the anti modding stance the devs took I'd have torrented the game years ago and saved myself 60 bucks.
0;Nice going Take Two.EDIT OpenIV is back.My review remains negative. The fact they ever attempted to ban singleplayer mods in the first place is disgusting and their knee jerk takeback is nothing more than an attempt to save face.The next in the series had better be fantastic for me to even think about buying it and supporting a company like this.Sorry Rockstar has to deal with the repurcussions of this bad press given to them by their parent company.
0;Single player used to be good anyway.Multiplayer public sessions were overflowed by cheaters but privat sessions were solution once. And a calm harbor for some RP stuff &amp players. And some honest modders who liked fun much over cheating crap. I guess even single player isn't an option with new hype train against Take2 modding policy. RIP GTA V.
0;Oh hey R* is doing another christmas event this year... Joins free roam lobby Gets imprisoned by modder Modder steals all the money from my bank account Rest of lobby laughs at my misfortune Just GTA V on christmas things.Seriously this game and it's community.
0;This game sucks!it was a great game these days but now... nah dont buy it..bluehole turnd into EA 2.0adding skins and a season pass?! just for the money. And while adding these things the game isnt even done yet... full of bugs . random disconnects cars are still gliching as hell and its completly desynct...ahh and one more point its full of hackers...
0;This game is awful. Its run by money grabbers The Online content is a grind of the same rewrapped and reheated coupled with problems and issues by modders and hackers. The ingame content is hugely over priced ($2000 for a T Shirt) and the stunt tracks and races are nothing short of programming that counldn't see past Sonic the Hedgehog.
0;i did enjoy this game but now with what take two and rockstar are doing to the modding scean well it just ruins the game. also there idea of the fact that take two thinks there undermonetizing the games that BROUGHT A 40 GAME. this is just wrong very bad.
0;What was once game of the year literally every year is not but a shadow of it's former self. All because Take Two Interactive stopped a core value of PC gaming. Modding. Teams of programmers who worked non stop to bring us OpenIV and FiveM have had their work stamped on by Take Two.This decision has no monetary impact on them and costs them no money. Their decision is unjust. you Take Two.
0;I didn't pay 60$ to play a grindfest. Granted there is a single player but Take two is taking away any incentive to actually play said single player if you haven't played it already. I'd recommend this game whenever Rockstar pulls it's head out of it's butt and releases a single player DLC like they promised a few years ago.
0;Rockstar is killing mods increasing in game prices and decreasing in game payouts. Paying $60 for a game to have most of its features locked behind a paywall is ridiculous and stupid. It isn't fun. Until Rockstar decides to care about the community and consumers the game is just a desperate cash grab.
0;Loved the GTA franchise not anymore. The reason so many copies of GTA IV were sold was because of modding and I was dissapointed to see how they handled modders in GTA 5 but it wasn't enough to rustle my jimmies. NOW that they decided to go a step beyond turning the back to modders and actually banning them. I am afraid of the future of the franchise. TLDR Don't buy the game Don't buy cards and don't pre order their upcoming games.
0;When you get yourself banned for no reason (no hacks no kills casual gaming) and not even 1 reason given for the perma ban... maybe it's time to move on to other game.PS after this ban i dont expect thay can remove cheater from the game... not when you ban those that d'ont use cheats.Good luck.
0;Game started out fine until I ran into a bug that causes a mission to automatically fail as soon as the mission start cut scene ends. I know this mission is the one to unlock the michael character to play so I'm stuck with just Franklin. Tried starting the game over from the beginning several times to see if anything would change but it hasn't. I don't know what's causing this bug but unless it gets fixed I consider this game a waste of time and money.
0;"""Do you like auto aim using level 150s with armored Kurumas that will do anything to """"rek"""" you? What about a horrible balancing system that will pit level 10s against 200s? Now add in semi auto instant kill sniper rifles and you've GTA online. Singleplayer is alright tho."""
0;well if your getting this game for modding like i did well then if i were you id skip it but if your fine with a (imo bland game) vehicle wise then go ahead and get it. but its just not to good to me have everything i need installed and it crashes every 3 5 minutes so i just cannot recommend it if you want to mod Ps. i only have vehicles and spg (single player garage)
0;Take Two sent OpenIV project a Cease and Desist order proving they are completely hostile to PC Gamers and passionate Modders who've devoted years of their time and energy into making fun projects and mods to play and enhance our games with. I will not be supporting any Take Two owned brands in the future because of this pathetic zealotry against modders.DO NOT BUY OR SUPPORT. TAKE TWO AND ROCKSTAR THREATEN MODDERS WITH LEGAL ACTION.
0;Rockstar is anti gamer and anti fun. They only care about accumulating shark card shekels and all the changes they made to GTA Online recently reflects this. And now making mods illegal this company has finally lost me. Glad i won't waste any more time on this boring as hell online game.
0;I bought this game on Xbox 360 AND Xbox One. I bought it on my PC in no small part to be able to mod it. In sending a cease and desist for OpenIV a SINGLEPLAYER ONLY modding tool Take Two has taken a big part of that away.Take Two has become greedy GTA Online has become a tool for selling Shark Cards. Anyone with a job or family doesn't have time necessary to afford anything in Online unless they spend several times the cost of the game buying Shark Cards. It's ridiculous.
0;"""&gt Enter Lobby&gt Get 3million dollars from modder&gt sweet.jpeg&gt Get teleported to the middle of the map along with the whole server&gt Get exploded 1000 times&gt Lose all that money&gt """"You have been banned from Grand Theft Auto Online.

0;dnt buy this game...too many modders ruining lobbies plus this game has poorly optimized graphics and bad network..frame drops and frequent disconnection has a major problem on this game and not to mention the mod used by hackers which can see your ip address while in lobbies so its a no no so do some research before diving head first...remember modders and hackers are supreme in this game not the rockstar itself.
0;You Take Two!OpenIV made the game alot better and all you want to do is screw everyone over who bought the game just to mod. you! You ruined R* and you're turning into the abominated TUMOR that is EA games!I hope you learn something from this! DON'T WITH US!
0;"""30h in and i have yet to find lobby online that has no scripter/hacker/modder in it .im realy disapointed about the fact that after such a long time this game has not improved at all when it coms to dealing with these people.i would definitely NOT recommend you buying this game for the online open world aspect becouse of the huge amount of """"hackers"""" in this game."""
0;After Take Two posted that moding on GTA V is illeagal I and many others have lost interest in the game. This has made us feel that the freedom that they have given us for 10 years was just taken away. Just because Take Two wants more money they taken what GTA V means to me and others.
0;Eh Don't buy it if you don't want to deal with modders getting you banned and a cash grab company that's only caring about stealing your money. Rockstar time to do some boycott. EDIT and worse than that Rockstar perm banned me an hour after i got unbanned on the 20Th of January. i wasnt cheating or anything.
0;ing game I may have a good amount of time but it is just a grind fest to buy stuff and now since single player modding is gone it isn't worth the 60 it cost they should pay you now to take the game because of how it is rockstar kill your self you you and your piece of game
0;Rockstar have created an absolute jewel of a game which Take two has decided to all over removing the modding scene of singleplayer as we know it and this not okay. So it really quite simple if Take (the Two revoke their decision my vote will change until then we don't negotiate with terrorists.
0;THEY TERK ER MODS.On a serious note We must fight to the right to repair and modify our own property corporations try taking this away from us in order to make a quick buck. Whether it be Rockstar or Apple we must fight to the right to our own products. However it be they decide to make money off of they're anti consumer practices ie proprietary Electronics void warranties or microtransactions we cannot stand for this. If we can't do want we want with our property is it really our property?
0;Single player was fun but I really got this for GTA Online which as a huge disappointment. Endless grinding for cash annoying limitations and a hacker in nearly every session to ruin the fun. Rockstar got their money and has already moved on I suggest you do the same.
0;I am so SICK and tired of the ing 15 20 minute loading screens it drives me up a wall. We get frozen doing heists because of these loading screens and honestly it makes me HATE opening up gta v because theres no point. The heists are sometimes the best way to get money but NO ONE JOINS OR DOES THEM so its a waste. Most of the time people are too busy being jerks or begging modders to give them stuff so theres really no amazing point to playing this game /
0;You really thought the PC community would let this one slide Take Two?Look at my play time. I haven't spent a single hour in online mode that's purely single player with mods. Online isn't fun single player isn't fun. If it weren't for modding I would have forgotten about this game years ago.
0;This game has changed so much. ITs now just a microtransaction laden With the news that OpenIV team have been given a Cease &amp Desist order from Take Two Interactive and are no longer allowed to make the backbone of the best mods around I hope you all follow the rest of us and rate this down. you Rockstar and Take Two Interactive.
0;rubbish gamerockstar are foolsthey reset my character with no reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I didnt do anything I think it just happen to modders but never play rockstar games any longerthere are lots of other good gameshope other companys make similar game as gtaV
0;This was a decent single player experience but now I sorely regret purchasing as the publisher has started going after the modders. Mod support was previously one of the more compelling reasons to purchase this on PC. The multiplayer is an awful microtransaction ridden pit of meaningless chaos.
0;Terrible servers. Malicious modders still rampant. Anti modding policies. scripting. GTA4's AI was better by 5 by a whole generation.And the only time when cuckstar actually comes to do something it's only about the money. They did a shot in the dark and removed anyone's money that looked any at all suspicious. Including innocent players that had nothing to do with the modder money issue.game about greed ran by greedy people.
0;So rockstar is super awesome. I had a modded single player account and tried to hop online a few times 2 days ago. The game wasn't working so I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. After 4 hours of it downloading I tried again to find out that my account was banned and all my stuff was gone for having mods IN SINGLEPLAYER. Good job rockstar
0;"""No extra content for singleplayer since launch. CheckSuper expensive online content under the name of """"free dlc"""". (I have seen less grindy korean mmos) CheckDo nothing about hackers at gta online for years. CheckDisable only tool that provides singleplayer content to the game. CheckThey just blame OpenIV for their lack of competence and lazyness."""
0;The past 4 major updates have all been rehashed from the same idea and are so expensive most players can't take part in them. The grinding is so bad worse than most MMOs. The game was actually fun back in 2015 when most of the content could be afforded after 1 or 2 heist runs.
0;Love the game but giving it a thumbs down for now. Afraid to play online for fear of getting banned for no reason which seems likely since most lobbies have modders.Update 6/17 Nothing I have seen from R* or the community has changed my view. If anything matters have gotten worse.
0;R* doesn't like that we the PCMR ''ruin'' the online ''experience'' by using for example FOV mod. Apparently it's an unfair advantage to have a substitute for the in built slider that doesn't change a thing. Nice 2 week ban and thanks Take Two for shutting down the ''dangerous'' mod project called GTA Multiplayer so you can earn more money from 12 year olds buying shark cards.
0;"""One of the best games I've played in my life but there are too many cheaters that are called as """"modder"""" and Rockstar is doing nothing. That's why I left the game months ago. Rockstar should be more strict while banning those people but I think they are not checking the people even. Same think happened also in the late times of Grand Theft Auto IV. Rockstar doesn't care about the game after 2 years of releasing time."""
0;"""They took away the only reason I had this game still installed.Since Take Two decided they were """"undermonetizing"""" their users and saw single player modding as a threat I'd recommend that nobody ever again purchases anything from them. Also remember their CEO basically said that the reason they didn't want to gouge us out of even more money wasn't because it was unethical but because we'd notice.Just in case remember Take Two also owns 2K and Firaxis."""
0;Honestly tired of the game. the loading times to play online are so bad I forget I have the game open some times. Not to mention the modders in the online environment always messing up the game by spawning players all over the place or spawning vehicals everywhere. What annoys me the most is when friends drop out of sessions or getting stuck on loading screens forcing them to close and reopen the game with these extremely long loading times.
0;Take Two seems to have all kinds of problems with modders who people support and who make the game more enjoyable but have zero issue and no qualms about jamming microtransactions down the throat of anyone who wants to actually enjoy their game. When I can't have fun in a $60 game without paying hundreds more for in game money so that the game is actually engaging there is a problem.
0;"""For shame Rockstar for shame. Shape up or no more cash for you I think.Take 2 have effectively banned moding in GTA V. Do not support them by buying their products.And if you really want to hit them where it hurts boycott Red Dead Redemption 2. RDR2 and possible hurt sales is probably the only reason the recent """"apology"""" by Rockstar was even released. Don't believe a word they say personally."""
0;As much as the game is fun I know people have been banned for being given money by hackers.Their anti cheat system is extremely unfair and aims itself at the wrong people.On a side note their recent event of shooting out a C&amp D shutting down OpenIV and multipleother fun mods is a complete let down.Companies lately have tried to show us that they know best and that the customer is wrong.I'm confident because we're proving that this isn't the case.
0;Back when I first bought this during the PS3 era I had great fun.Then I bought it again for the PS4 release it was still good (also I got to complete the story finally).Then the most important release the PC version. Finally we could mod the game!Well so much for that. Take Two has ruined whatever hope there was for this game to live past its expiration date.
0;"""Uninstalled this Game after 619h in game time for the following reasons OpenIV Prohibition Insanely high prices for MP content especially for someone who only plays MP casually Passive opposition against the creative/modding community No Singleplayer Updates/Support pretty much since day one The greedy f*cks from TakeTwo should rename their company to """"TakeAll"""" or """"Smaug's Cave"""""""
0;I just tryed to play online and it says that ive been banned until 2/7/17. really? for what? This is my first ban EVER and im instantly banned for a month with my character reset FOR NOTHING. I do not recomend this games online for its gltichy anti hacking software and its failure to ban real hackers. DO NOT FARM FOR MONEY it WILL result in a ban like me!
0;Rockstar and Take Two shoud be supportive of modders especially when they are only used for single player. Blocking many mods was bad enough but cease and desisting Open IV was the final straw and a total d**k move. I will no longer recommend this game or any other Take Two games.
0;Why kill OpenIV Mods for Singleplayer if the Problem are the numerous hackers in Online Mode? Online Play right now is a waiting in the lobby simulator while you try to hide from Godlike i will permanently get you banned hackers. Would still have given thumbs up for the amazing Singleplayer but banning mods ruined that too..
0;So it takes about an between 5 70 mins to load in whether its multiplayer or single. For only 400$ you can buy saints row 2! Now there's also an element of luck if you don't want to pay in that maybe you get a modder who is willing to lag your game out into unplayability by giving you tons of cash. Now thats a rare occurance. More often than not you're an unwilling barbie doll for a modder. To dress up burn and imprison as they please.
0;Take two A bunch of tw*ts that banned/Removed modding Not only for Online Which is understandable But also for Single player They then hope that by removing the key feature in single player that more players will go over to Multiplayer I would recommend the game about a month ago but now it just seems to have been F*cked over by Take two.Wouldnt recommend this game anymore.
0;Single player is alright but it's burdened by Rockstar Social Club.Online is a hot mess of corporate greed and hackers. You can spend loads of money and hours setting op thing like cargo sales only to have a hacker blow it up while spamming models on you to make the game crash causing you to lose everything. Rockstar's response? Don't cheat everybody now buy our shark cards.Don't bother.
0;"""Has both good and bad feeling toward this gameGood pretty fun game and nice DLCs Good for playing with your friendsBad Hackers are in every sessions They don't do anything much to hacker (That why there are more and more hackers) Hate speech on online sessionIt's a good game until you have hackers in the session and they try to show off their hacking """"skill""""."""
0;Singleplayer is alright Multiplayer is an open cesspool full of a cancerous community with a ridiculous grind that is not enjoyable in any way which gives you the option to spend hours getting enough money to buy a small minivan or just paying $100 and getting it straight away.
0;Rockstars Publisher Taketwo killed Singleplayer money just to force microtransactions on online players when hacking is still a legitimate problem. Also sets a horrible example as Taketwo has also just recently aquire Kerbel Space Program and owns other such games like XCOM.
0;Take Two seems hellbent on ruining any game they touch. The multiplayer is an expensive mess because they want you to buy game money with real money. The singleplayer lacks a lot of vehicles that are in the multiplayer so you cannot enjoy them without grinding for hours.And now the are getting rid of the modding scene ridiculous! Awful company.
0;If you plan on buying this to mess around in freemode dont bother as it is filled with modders with god mode and everything else under the sun making it pointless to even bother playing and considering that you are forced to play in public sessions to do anything with bunker MC stuff etc escaping to a invite only session is pointless
0;Since the latest update population on servers appear to have dropped. I am not loving the recent update personally.Because modders in the Online Sessions dropped cash on people prior to new update RockStar wiped clear many character accounts of not only cash given but cash earned or even purchased with SharkCards.The single player mode now greatly affected by the banning of Take Two. Cloud Sync Issues this morning gave me the time to write this review.
0;"""Single player was fun but when it's over you are left with a multiplayer experience which will turn you off the game completely. In order to enjoy multiplayer at all you must invest hundreds more of your own dollars through """"shark cards"""" due to rediculously expensive dlc products add that with a huge hacking community and you have a game that once was great but now I prefer taking that burn so much I'm left in tears."""
0;Ya know a fair game for the visually impaired but far from good. I need to be able to move the radar to the right and make notifications a LOT larger or easier to find in the menus for reading immediately. Due to all the people with mods it's just not a fun game at all now.
0;The OpenIV thing was honestly the last straw for me with this game. We are no longer allowed to modify our singleplayer game so it's actually fun to play while cheaters and modders are still rampant on the online servers. WTF? I now have a 60 game which is basically unplayable after completing the story with broken multiplayer milked to death by Rockstar and not being able to mod my SP for and giggles.
0;Online is crap Loading times are way too long Pay to win with Shark Cards Hard to earn lots of money on your own Not many people playing heists Toxic community Basically no anti cheatSingleplayer is bad No modding support Story is okay No support for the singleplayer (no DLC released) Content additions in multiplayer do not apply to singleplayer
0;Great game but for some reason got banned for 30 days and player reset. Played the game honestly and this is what you get. All the modders bragging about what they can get and to us normal players we get shafted. (Rockstar will fall by way of Ubisoft) will never purchase another game from/for them again. Don't waste ur time with this game!!!!!
0;Get ready to get banned when you start GTA OnlineThe game is infested with hackers and the way R* detects cheaters is hilarious.I have no mods or have tampered with the game in any way and still somehow get striked.You're first 2 strikes are temp bans and you're 3'rd is a perma. Not even having recordings will save your a $s3/5 The singleplayer is great.
0;I write this negative review in hope of take 2 interactive and the rockstar team will repeal the manhunt on the moders and other game breaking creators like the people behind OpenIV.And for those that are intrested in stocks here they are. http //www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ttwo/after hours
0;This microtransaction mindset has gone too far take two. I have bought this game three times and even though I have enjoyed it the ridiculous way you push your money grabbing to the point of whiping out the entire modding community is disgusting.I am uninstalling this after years of playing and I won't be buying another one of your products. You are what is wrong with this industry.
0;stupid immature cash grabbing from the company that owns it forcing players into multiplayer like cattle to a micro laden slaughter house. the single player is a great game save for the fact its shot in the back in order to encourage people to play the multiplayer.
0;"""Don't buy this game unless you only want to play story mode or play online by yourself in a private lobby. The first time I went into a public lobby my friends and I were killed repeatedly by modders. And if that wasn't enough later that day rockstar banned me for """"violating the EULA"""" when I had done no such thing. Plus when you contact support they say all bans are final. Don't waste your money on this game."""
0;I love this game but the developers treat the playerbase like They add new content every now and then but leave game breaking bugs in hopes that players buy their overpriced shark cards that no one gives a about. Honestly its easier to get a hacker to spawn in cash. Worst of all they recently removed online modding completely making the hard work of modders that try to make mods for others to enjoy unplayable while hackers still run rampant.
0;"""My experience with GTA online can be summed up in 3 steps 1. Work my off on heists to build up around 8 mil2. Log back on after the latest update ready to buy a cool new vehicle3. See that I only have $52 in my bank and nothing in pocketThanks for taking my """"illegitimate money"""" Rockstar!!"""
0;This game is just garbage now. It's pay to have fun as everything takes either days to grind out or you have to spend HUNDREDS OF REAL DOLLARS to ing do anything. Your game should not be that bad where you have to pay to do that. Online is full of modders and people who just KOS because why tf not.
0;Got banned for offline singleplayer mods ban not able to be appealed. I mean sure the upgrades as of late have been great but the absolute stupidity of the customer support and the outrageous pricing of things has turned the game sour.In the past 2 months that i was playing before being banned for no proper reason nearly every lobby i joined had modders giving other players money. Says a lot about the rockstar is pulling.6/10 but not worth reccomending.
0;Devs are scumsucking s who will release a game three times on a slow heroin drip so dumb ers like you will buy it more than once oh and they charge for in game currency because they're too ing lazy to do the work and add actual content. Don't support these money grubbing asshats buy mount and blade and mod the out of it instead
0;As of this moment I really can not reccomend this game and untill modders are sorted out i am not playing it again I just lost an entier shipment due to modders and that took weeks of grinding in and out of my work life unless rockstar compensate me with some in game $$$ i am not coming back to this game for a very long time!!!
0;I paid money for this game to play online with my friends yet am inclined to leave and join new lobbies every 20 minutes or so due to modders lagging the game by spawning in cars or whatever. Rockstar is too busy adding in Dixon and the Black Madonna to fix this major problem of modders so I don't reccomend the game to anybody at this time.
0;"""As for the actual game its great. I've had alot of fun... Online however is a very bumpy road. To be honest I would rather just have a bare bones multiplayer """"sandbox"""" where you could mess around with your friends and favorite mods. Other than that i find the limitations of GTA Online very restricting and therefore limiting the fun im having with friends"""
0;when i go to gta 5 online it is rare that i have the slightest of fun. mainly because of the people in the server so i go to another server and its the same thing. if you have no money you can't reallly do anything . and whos idea was it too add a mini gun to gta 5 online?
0;With Rockstar and Take Two recent decision to ban offline modding I cannot recommend this game. Rockstar and Take Two should embrace the modding community instead of treating them like garbage as modding is what keeps games alive and enjoyable well beyond their prime.
0;Take 2 Rockstar's parent company has essentially declared that modding is now illegal. They sent a cease and desist letter to the creators of OpenIV the backbone of single player modding in GTA V. The reason is they want to drive people away from singleplayer to multiplayer where players will buy microtransactions. I would definitely not recommend this game.
0;I will not stand for mods just suddenly not being allowed. It's part of what made this game so fun to play around with in a huge open world where the possibilities were almost endless. If they take that freedom away i will no longer support any of take twos games. my time will be much better spent playing Bethesda games which have allowed mods for years.
0;Take two wants to kill their game. Banning all MODs.Edit 7/7/2017 Open IV might be back which is good they heard us out. Well least Rockstar did. Rockstar was able to pressure or rather come to some senses with Take Two but Take Two in the way they worded things this could easily go back to how it was. I enjoy Rockstar and I'm glad they did the right thing. Though I can't support Take Two so I won't be changing this back to positive. Maybe one day Rockstar can branch away from Take Two.
0;Devs don't care about the players and are trying to get as much money as they can from the players. New update is worth 80 million which translates to around 600$ for the new dlc. They also offer no way of making money fast and then when they double payouts they take all the earned money away just so one of the players will buy a shark card.
0;The core mechanics are some of the best I've seen. Driving flying and shooting are all loads of fun in both the singleplayer and multiplayer.The downside is the multi player's economy is rigged to keep you running an incessant ratrace in an attempt to force the player into buying ingame $.
0;"""Got banned once for somebody else made a ticket response was a joke.Got banned a second time made a ticket same response as above.R* has a policy of not appealing bans or looking into what you provide them for proof.If you buy this game for online play just think about the fact that after 1 2 years they will just """"block"""" you and delete your whole progress."""
0;"""new """"shark cards"""" are disgustingly overpriced. R* is going to the dark side.. even players who get banned for hackers actions are 100% ignored by R* with no chance of appeal (and acc reset). the game is pretty good though if you can evade hackers and other bs lul"""
0;Not much to say I bought this game on pc solely for the amazing modding potential Now that Rockstar and 2K have nixed that the pc version is basically worthless in my eyes. I don't and never have given a rats about mulitiplayer. The 200+ hours on my record are just from messing around with various mods. I wish I could get a refund now.
0;I honestly just can't reccomend this game. It's such a shameless cashgrab and it's truely a shame to see that Rockstar one of my favorite (used to be) game developers has taken such a route. However you gotta hand it to them they do take us for the idiots that we indeed are.
0;Offline it's the best game of it's type. Online it's awful. I can't even get into the options to change anything without it crashing. That leads to at least five minutes of loading screens to get back into the game for it to crash again. it I give up on this
0;Becasue of the policies against OpenIV which is designed to force you into the garbage online so you may spend money I cannot recommend this game. The best part of this game on PC is the modding community and the worst part is the multiplayer. WIthout mods you are better off continuing to play on a next gen console if you already have it there.
0;GTA is a very fun game to play and love playing online with my friends as well as single player.However after the horrible update where you are no longer allowed to use mods even when playing with no one but YOURSELF. Your account will be banned to me this is unfair and a horrible horrible step made by the owner.I am giving this game a negative review solely because of this incredibly awful step.
0;I haven't seen this many hackers since I played unreal tournament 2004. The game is unplayable unless you do some uninteresting resource monitor shenanigans to escape the hackers who have full control of the game. Also said hackers can get you banned for their hacks. Can't care any less about the shark cards either buy them or don't. Last rockstar game I will buy.
0;It's not pay to win It's pay to have fun... When a game adds a sence of progression it's usually good but in this case you'll find yourself wanting to play all the new updates that have and relise you need millions to do that. To get 8 000 000 in game cash which will get you 'a few nice things or a big boat' you will need to pay $100 out of your own pocket! For a game that's about 2 years old on PC these prices are unreasonable. I can no longer recommend GTA V
0;Rockstar til ow me 1x Megalodon Shark card thet got lost... don't buy shark cards.. the problem i had for the last month was that I bought 2x Megalodon Shark card the same day and didn't get one.. now rockstar have sent me 8 000 000 gta$ our of 16 000 000GTA$..
0;DONT BUY THIS GAME! Its not fun its glitchy its a grind a pay to win and a lot of other issues. They keep adding little *heres a small amount of money that cant buy you anything* events so you keep playing but it wants you to pay more money to buy stupid vehicles to around in the multiplayer. honestly the single player is okay its okay NOT WORTH $60 THOUGH!
0;"""Rockstar anti cheat is awful and can't tell cheaters from non cheaters apparently as I was banned for no reason. This is why we need dedicated servers instead of this P2P crap. Rockstar has gone the cheapo route because their main concern is more $$$. Hundreds of negative reviews of people being banned for no reason. Think about it they can't all be lying. Think twice before buying this game for the multiplayer. At least there's FiveReborn.I will not be """"purchasing"""" anymore games from them."""
0;There are Free DLCs but you can't actually use them if you don't have ingame money. Funny how a frickin' car horn costs $75.000 and you earn a $20.000 from a heist setup. Heists are cancer with the online community anyways. Rockstar support doesn't give a rat's ... about you they just auto reply almost anything. This is actually much more evil then releasing a priced DLC. Not even gonna talk about OpenIV because that's a whole level of another story.
0;I didn't do anything No external plugins No modification of game data Did not do anything illegal I was banned from the GTAOL.Game is good no one can deny that. And it worth its price even just for the offline part great story! It would be wonderful if another company will run the online game because Rstar sucks at it.
0;singel playerpros.*it's perfect gamecons.*nothing i see yet....online game pros.*umm fun missions with alot of friendscons.*servers stability*lagg*lag g g ggg *someone shoots the civ standing next to me *bang* *bang* 1 sec after... BUSTEDand yeah...anti cheat systemdoes not existand the hackers... well they ... like thatbut if u play in closed friends session on online and will endure the lag... it will be awesome game for you and friends... D after my pc upgrade its rocks again
0;stan Man i am edsomeone whats wrong stanstan its the moders they give free money that i don t want in onlinesoemone them moders u see this counter strike and rocket leaguestan i gess ur right someone whos no oneSomeone yeahh need for speed don t forget that partstan thanks i think life as not chosen gta V as my favourite game for now...
0;I got permanently banned for no reason and the guys over at Rockstar dont care at all. It is sad that such a loved game from the past will end like this will all of us hating them. Thanks rockstar for wasting my time and 60 dollars. Get your straight.
0;I've been playing this game for 2 years. I finish the campaign and then go to the multiplayer but after playing the multiplayer for 1 year I get bored. They make updates but nothing new. I'ts the same thing over and over and it starting to get boring.I wouldn't recomand this game in 2018 because there are more multiplayer games that are more intresting.
0;Was a fun game now it just has toxic online community. Lack of real content ( single play exspanstion) is sad. Just because they make it free online content dosent mean its good. Story mode is great (but after you 100% there is literly nothing to do). But drive around and shoot people or mod cars. If you can pick it up super cheap do it. But dont bother with online its a JOKE!!
0;iest online multiplayer usability EVER. If I want to play a session with a friend who sits in another room I CANNOT DO IT since the f*ing developers dont bother adding server browsers to the game or any easy interface to join games together! And I can get old during the loading screens. Loading screens even when EXITING the session. WTF ROCKSTAR???
0;DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEGood game at launch. Played it with all my heart until the last update from which point I keep getting banned for no apparent reason. I know Rockstar have up'd their game on ant cheat engines but also banning casual players isn't really an effective one. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ANYMORE! Unless you want to spend hours on writing emails to Rockstar Support to remove your bans.
0;Product received for free. I do love this game its my favorite BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE WORST GAME CUZ IT CANNOT PLAY OFFLINE MODE CUZ OF YOUR ACCOUNT THUS THE GAME SAYS THAT ROCKSTAR UPDATE SERVICE IN UNAVAILABLE LIKE U CAN HELP US CAN SUPPORT US EVEN SERVICES ARE ONLINE IS UNAVAILBALE I WOULD SAY I HATE YOU AND THE GAME FIX THIS STUPID ISSUE THANK YOUNOTE IF U DONT FIX THIS PEOPLE WILL HATE U CUZ U CANT HELP OUR PROBS OF THE GAME OK OK!!!!
0;You've probably already seen the same review about several hundered times so I'll keep it brief. GTA Online is trash for new players. If you want to buy this game buy it when its on sale and enjoy the single player campaign. If you really feel the itch to play a multiplayer GTA join one of the many GTA multiplayer communities and enjoy yourself. There's plenty to see and do in both of these choices not to mention the near unltimited content you can find from the modding community.
0;i really have not been a fan of this game recently. With the latest update It's near impossible to play the game on 8gb of ram. I actually ordered 16gb of ram just for this game. When I have to spend over 100 dollars to have a game run properly even though 8gb is reccommended that's when it's fixing time.
0;Decent singleplayer for what it's worth. Going online is a gamble. Whether you're dealing with modders who have nothing better to do griefers who want to pad their KDA morons who ruin your heists or just Rockstar themselves looking to ban you because Discord updated and re enabled its overlay which flags their system as a modder. Maybe wait until GTA 6 and hope for some major changes in support and leadership of the game. This one is just bad.
0;Used to be on my BEST GAME EVER list.Now filled up with terrorible gamers with either horrible skills or manner. Hard to enjoy. Trying hard to buy cool stuff by joining in millions of quests then get fuxked by cash players HEAD TO TOE. Basically no in game payment no joy.Less and less fun of cooperation . Salty and Heartbroken.I guess it's time for you and I to break up.
0;2017 After hearing about the news on the GTA forums and how the modding community has been treated. T2 the only reason GTA is as popular as it is isn't just down to the quality work Rockstar have put into the games but its also down to the players and what they do with them.I can't begin to describe how bad I feel about this situation. Back in 2015 I love this game because it's everything I wanted in a GTA title!The GTAO updates just keep on adding more and more stuff to do with friends online.
0;This a a good base game with great grapics but the servers are toasters that are slow and unstable. The online servers are also riddled with hackers as a result of one of the many hackers that i have encounter i have lost on average 800000 dollars in ammo in guns and other items. It is a impossible game with hackers every where and half of my hours being loading servers. over potental ruined. IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED
0;The online version of this game was made to milk your wallet! I would not recommend it to anyone it takes ages to make money and have fun. But story mode is great in my opinion! They should have made the online game easier at least for the money making part.
0;its a good game when playing single player but with the modders and everything thats ben going on with rock star i would not recoment it you will literally spend hours grinding and doing heist just to get into a lobby with a modder then you get banned and account gets reset witch is stupid the modder will literally freeze your character dump millions onto your character then instead of rockstar banning the modder they just ban you....
0;The game itself is fun but I haven't joined a single lobby online that didn't have a modder in it dropping planes on people or tripping you up with water. It was funny at first but after it keeps happening over and over and over and over it quickly stops being funny.
0;A great game being held down by greedy a holes from Take Two. Screw you for what you've done to OpenIVEDIT A few months after this sh*tstorm things have calmed down a bit. GTA Online is still ar*e tho.EDIT no. 2 You wanna buy this game? Do it for the story and so that you can play FiveM the multiplayer modification. Much better than Online.
0;I am uninstalling this game right now. I will keep it short. Hackers!!!You spend hours to make some money. One hacker shows up and destroys everything in seconds.Everyday and every session there is always hackers. The worst part is that GTA makers dont punish the hackers.It is a hacker paradise. I will never buy a rockstar game again.
0;I used to love this game so much back in January when the doomsday update came out. About 2 months later though i've been experiencing porblems with online where the game crashes after about 30 minutes of play.. This is a common thing amongst many gta players is there a way I can fix this? I really want to play the game and this bug is ruining everything. Probs 1/5 for now unless this gets fixed
0;2013 Oh hell yes new game was released. I hope there will be singleplayer DLCs.2014 No DLC for single player. Lets just wait. New gen versions release but still no single player.2015 PC version release but no DLCs for offline mode2016 CEO and Bikers? Im asking for single player DLC2017 Weaponized vehicles? No single player DLCs? come on Rockstar2018 Hotring Races and Clubs. No fruking single player DLCsNice fu king job Rockstar
0;This game is a waste of money i got banned for no reason and was banned permanantly because a modder spawned cash on me. I got a shark card and rockstar will not refund me this is horrible. It is fun to start off but afterwards the game becomes very boring because there is nothing to do and everything is overpriced.And now they have en got rid of single player mods YOU ROCKSTAR GAMES
0;man i heard gta v is an amazing gameand i think i got trolled this game is good with the single/offline modbut the online dont telling you this if your friends dont have gta v have fun having your time WASTED by inviting rendomslets just hope gta 6 wont be like this
0;As im not really into online multi with this game i love it but!! i really wish they would throw in updates for singleplayer its really annoying seeing all the content pushed into online.... for that i cant suggest buying it. i have over 2 100 hours into this game i would love to see some singleplayer content.
0;"""im so glad rockstar is the biggest piece of when it comes to banning. will get banned for supossed using mods but when some ing loner 40 y/o raging guzzler who has no freinds because he lives in his mothers basement kicking people out of games telling you """"HaVe FuN ReLoAdInG tHe GaMe"""" Really? you and your whole cancer community. shove a nice one right up the cant even make good new content. you and every developer who has ever worked on this game"""
0;GTA V is an amazing game very fun to play.The Online mode sucks.But you know what sucks even more?Take Two Interactive.Screw you you soulless corporate machine of c*cksuckers.You greedy little idiots who make thousands of hours of work literally vanish into nothing by c&amp d'ing OpenIV.Go f*ck yourself.
0;I cant play this game anymore cause whenever I try to play theres a Social Club intialization error code 1014 and I searched all of over the internet for the solution but there is none.And I have spent over $300 on this gam epreviously before this error occured.Such a waste...
0;fun to play good story but with a few exeptions of playing this game online still a lot of hackers online sessions wont always load or you get kicked out of them randomly long loading times which can take up to over 30 minutes if you're doing a heist.It's a fun game but these things make it very frustrating. Its defenetly not worth the full price so I'm glad I got it for only 20 bucks on sale.
0;Here's a realistic review of this game Story Mode is actually fun and feels greatOnline mode is a no go it'll be fun for a while but then said fun will be ruined by hackers and modders.Now to everyone asking if the game is worth 60$ for the offline mode...No it is not wait for it to be on sale.If you want details on the game i'll gladly add you as a friend to tell you more about the reasons you shouldn't buy this game at all.Finally for what you did to OpenIV i dare say Screw this game.
0;While the online continues to be plagued by hackers who ruin every single game with ridiculous exploits the Publisher considers single player mods to be a threat. Since the game release nothing has been done to stop online exploits.As is there is nothing of value in GTA V after the first story playthrough.The Online is a miserable wasteland of hackers playing against hackers.The Singleplayer is only good once without mod support.
0;Rockstar have just added more and more cars and motorbikes that allow for so much more griefing and it makes it unplayable I can't do any missions in the lobby because I'm being chased by a flying car that can fire rockets how am I suppose to do anything? The answer is pay rockstar and there you go now you can do what you want.
0;i got banned for a month on my online account and i have never done any exploiting modding or any cheating of any kind and not only that but my online characters and progress has been wiped Rockstar also does not care about customer support if i submit a ticket about my false ban then it is automatically disreguarded and i never get help it is also almost impossible to get any more support then that and im not the only one with this problem so rockstar can go die in a hole
0;While GTAV has been fun Rockstar has repeatedly treated their single player community horribly and this attack on mods is the last straw. Nobody should even bother touching this game until Take Two decides to stop trying to wring every little bit of money out of their customers with little to no effort on their part to actually improve the game.
0;filled with hackers online it takes forever to get anywhere without cheating and what was the point of doing the same missions for hours? you get a shiny thing after a week of grinding only for a cheater to go *click* and unlock everything on top of that. just cheat in the online and save yourself a lot of time.or just spend like a few thousand dollars to save yourself 1 2k hours of grinding money lol
0;So have had this game for ages on console and PC. Killing mods for the sake of money? Take Two honeslty how the hell do you claim to under monetize users when you EARN more then a 100% in a quaterly per annum. Like 60 bucks on a game purchase multiple times isn't enough? A game that becomes uselss after the endgame? A game whose online feature is a money pit and is trash for what it provides? Get a life honestly. Screw you guys.
0;"""The SOLO mode in this game is awesome. The ONLINE mode was okay until some modders forced TakeTwo to make a """"No Modding Policy"""" which is ridiculous and I will not stand for it. I'm leaving a negative review because TakeTwo sent a Cease and Desist to the OpenIV team which is a modding software that helps enables a MASSIVE amount of mods for GTA."""
0;"""Welp been banned for using single player modding tools. Hell I think you don't care about your players/customers that much do you?So reat job Rockstar you let a automated servers take over your and you have no override command to unban anyone so great job you lost a huge amount of customers for pulling a move like that. For anyone thinking about buying this game don't because if you get bored of it in single player and want to add in a little """"extra"""" watch out."""
0;If you like a game where after 3 years of playing fairly you get banned (along with several other innocent players even though they unbanned you after) then go ahead and buy the game. Game runs on high priced DLC with no attention to community or its feedback. NOT RECOMMENDED.
0;Hello yesterday Rockstar Studios sent an e mail saying that for some reason my GTA5 Online model had been blocked for 30 days.This account ensures that there is no cheating or misconduct.Ask customer service or Rockstar studios to identify the cause check the account and check if it was missealedGive me an answer as soon as possible.Thank you!
0;"Optimization is joke Hitreg is incosistent ""CHINA NAMBA WAN"" So many updates and I still get gamebraking glitches Game is full of cheaters You can get STDS straight from public chat +You can learn chinese in no time even on EU/NA servers+Fun for people with wallhacks+If you like downloading 26mb anticheat updates every 10minutes"
0;Rockstar has turned this game into 80% wait on loading screens or grind to 20% play. Do not recommend and I hope the next Red Dead Redemption does not follow this path because we acctually like that francise.AAA games in general have been really this past couple years.
0;The multiplayer experience is fun with friends but when you get transferred to a public lobby with modders... THAT however isn't fun. Got perm banned on both of my accounts because rockstar can't fix their anti cheat measures And support was REALLY helpfull by telling me that my account was permanently banned and couldn't do anything about.Spend your $60 on something else )
0;Messing with the community was a terrible decision Take Two. Do you really think that killing the mod tools would stop cheaters? Well you're wrong. They always find a way. We the legit players that only want to enjoy a fun single player experience are the ones affected by your decision. RIP OpenIV.
0;I used to like GTA5. But as time has gone on the singleplayer has stagnated due to a lack of DLC and the multiplayer has become a hacker infested hell hole. Not only this but everything in the multiplayer has been made just for micro transactions. Want that new rocket car that actually looks like fun well better buy over $10m of in game cash. You cant even get these cars in the singleplayer which is utterly ridiculous.
0;17/10/2018Every lobby has griefers/modders ranging from the subtle speeders/flame throwers (whilst they are sitting in a vehicle passively or half way across the map) to the extreme where they spawn an infinite stream of jumb jets on you that push you under the world and eventually memory leak your computer going beyond ruining your game but also locking up your computer or worse.Stay away from this expensive mess it's a childs sandbox for idiots.
0;Mo more modding really? Way to off your fan base. I hate online with passion mods made my single player experience 1000x better. You contribute to story and now you are going after mods? off! This is the last product I will purchase from your hole. Take Two and Rockstar are on my list from now on.Peace among worlds i!i
0;Get this game on a console. Not worth paying full price on PC unless you want to get your account suspended for no reason at all. Just because you're in a lobby with some other hacker. Plus the first offence is a complete reset of your characters that you spent so much time on and a 30 day suspension. It's too harsh. So not worth it unless you only want to play single player. Otherwise a great game ruined by their strict anticheat checks which bans you for no reason at all.
0;If you aren't great at or don't want to farm heists be prepared to spend massive amounts of money in 'shark cards' for cars.A single car can range up to an equivilent of about $75.00. And there are multiple vehicles at that price. You could easily spend over $1000 to get all the top vehicles.The game is fun yes but the grind isn't very easy to burn out.
0;Good game but an atrocious DLC model which incentivises microtransactions to keep up along with a horrible stance on modding makes your purchase supportive of the kind of publisher that makes these kinds of things okay.Don't buy it. They don't deserve your money.
0;Disabling mods? Seriously Rockstar? Your games have replayability BECAUSE OF THOSE MODS! GTA franchise is the most modded and moddable franchise. And you shut that project down? You shot yourselves in the leg fellas you'll understand that sooner or later.
0;Game is great fun only problem is micro transaction hell and they ruined mods by taking down an essential mod that allowed other mods to work. Modding is a huge selling point in the game and is the reason many people play it and just because the devs aren't making money on shark cards they decide to ruin single player so they go to multiplayer. It's ridiculous the game is one of the most profitable of all time then they randomly pull this This needs to be fixed...
0;Take two would like you to stop modding the single player portion of the game and go spend 90 for a single car in their unpunished cheater filled online modeSo they made modding their game illegalI will never be buying another product from take two interactive or rockstar games again
0;Get it for the Single Player not the toxic Online. Online can have loading screens easily exceeding 20 minutes on the regular. Not just for initial boot but when missions end. Everything is expensive you're better off just buying a modded account to get what you want. A lot of it is a worthless grind.
0;i have been addicted to this game for over a year and a half now. but after the new gunrunning dlc came out all of my (legit) cash was taken from my account. i just got cash from a modeder who felt sorry for me today and after buying 1 thing in the ingame website's it wont let me use my bank anymore. sad 2 say this but gta is dead and this is the update that killed it.
0;"""Do not buy if you're expecting a """"free mode multiplayer"""" the online mode in this game is just another career mode and if you do try to play with other people or just meet new people they'll just think you're going to kill them so they kill you first it's a ing shambles also single player gets absolutely no attention clearly this game is made for online mode to make money and that's it"""
0;Unless you're willing to swipe your credit card with each update be prepared to spend a few hundred hours grinding for paltry sums of ingame currency to purchase vehicles that ultimately are outclassed by the next update.Otherwise the single player is pretty neat.
0;"""This game was good then rockstar saw how much people like the online feature. And now every GTA after this is going to be nothing but a cash Grab as in """"here are some real fancy and cool idea for $100 + irl. GTA is a good game but owned and made by a greedy company."""
0;A ton of hackers. the company doesnt care really about hackers. 100% you will find one or more hackers on any server you go to. You can play in a pvt group. but if you want the big bucks you gota play on public servers where hackers are. other then that its just redneck rampageOH! if you do have a hacker on the server you are on YOU can get banned for what he is doing while he gets off scot free. beware before you play or buy
0;They banned me for cheating.... i never cheated.. i wrote to them about it they just said its prema and they will not lift it nor talk about it... i miss playing the game with my friends best online game i have played wish i could get my account back and my progess... (
0;Oh hello there you're about to buy this game and spend more money and waste your life on it? well today is the day where i tell you do not purchase because you will be banned if you play fair. save your money today. I'm dissapointed i played this game since day 1 transfered from an old console to PC and then i get told i wasted my time and i get everything wiped. Dissapointed in you rockstar.
0;Pros Blow stuff up Good storyCons Buying shark cards isnt really optional Rockstar customer service try to make money on events but then Rockstar steals it and calls it 'illegitimate' Multiplayer is heavily militarized and requires friends to enjoy it Lots of hackers Its possible to get perma banned when a hacker drops money on youHonestly though i did get my moneys worth out of it before being banned even if i spent most of that time complaining
0;Grinding for way too expensive items and wasting ur life isn't much fun when there are so many people that have reached the top and once reaching the top there is nothing left except pvp and griefing OR MORE GRINDING FOR ANOTHER UPDATE0/10 worst Military attacking poor people trying to make money simulator
0;Hackers... hackers everywhere.GTA Online is just simply doomed. In every lobby there is at least on hacker/modder call them what you want. They are almost unstoppable now. And what R* does is a joke... or even worse than that. If you want to buy this game for the online experience just DON'T. The console version is much more clean. (PS4 and XBOX ONE)
0;After banning OPENIV I really don't see why you would buy this game anymore.We as gamers have to take a stance and stop spending money on Rockstar / Take Two until the issue with singleplayer mods is resolved. After so many years of allowing modding of GTA games it really is a d*ck move to ban mods in this game.As a community I hope we can achieve something by giving low scores and bad reviews for this game.
0;Eat my Take Two. The only reason I bought this on PC was to mod it. This will not solve your online hacker problem so again eat my .. They even patched gta4 for the first time in 7 ING years So people have trouble modding that too. eat my you greedy ing kunts
0;This is on the behalf of the OpenIV team. OpenIV doesnt allow ANY online compatiblilty. If you were to attempt to go into GTA5 Online with your OpenIV's changed files it would revert you back to single player! There's no reason for this to happen! https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;I had to go back to GTA V on ps4 because of all the hackers. I have always played legit and the fear of getting banned from ppl that hack and mod is just nuts. I have to make clear i have not been banned but reading people that have for no reason makes me just play it safe and play on ps4.
0;The game is fun and all but the servers are you get disconnected half the time when trying to play with friends. Also its pay to win the economy is balanced very unrealistic and thrives on corporate greed. Heists only pay 300k max when a luxury car is like 1.5m. There are starving children in Africa and rockstar is charging $99.99 for a virtual yacht. Gameplay is fun but the pay to win economy is literal aids
0;Great singleplayer campaign worst online community ever. matchmaking no filtering by player level hackers everywhere toxic community. Online sucks period.Buy it if it's on sale like I did but only if you've never played the singleplayer campaign. DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR THE ONLINE FEATURE. You WILL regret it.
0;won't let us mod the game off line just so they can sell more shark cards just because a few hackers were giving free money same reason they stopped the gta stock market because it was making people rich and we can't have that as rich people dont need shark cards.greed company this game is 5 years old and is still at full price will never buy another rock star/take 2 game again.
0;So I recieved this as a gift during the 50% off sale. Less than 12 hours into my gameplay and I get a 30 day suspension. The only character I had I played with friends only. No mods no cheats. She only had 50k in the bank one 2 car garage and the free car available ingame. Bang gone. Glad it was half price.
0;On behalf of all modders who spent hours upon hours of their free time improving and fixing your game for free...On behalf of all your paying customers who have been robbed of a way to still enjoy the game years after its release...On behalf of everyone who's going to get ed over in the future by the precedent you've set this day...Update 2017 cant even load game after not playing for some time as usual STUPIC SOCIAL CLUB ISSUES!!! THIS IS GARBAGE FOR THE MONEY WE HAVE PAID FOR!!!!
0;If you want this for singleplayer only go ahead.Multiplayer is a mess. Hackers and connectivity issues abound. at least one hacker in every server blatantly discussing hacking methods and how not to get caught in global chat. Asking other players to report a hacker was met with threat of banning BY the hacker. I have no doubt it was possible after reading other reviews.STAY AWAY until something is done.
0;The solo mode is great and worth playing but the online became more and more trash as years came by Pay to win the richer you are the better your arsenal is. Full of microtransactions and outrageous prices for e v e r y t h i n g. Cheaters and modders everywhere! Awesome! Cancerous community.
0;Game has gone down hill since its first released in 2013.. It's pretty much just a battle royale in any public lobby you get.. The game has turned in to a grind for money much worse than it was at release. New cars that have nothing really new to give and cost way too much for the stats. Game is riddled with modders killing you with hydrants and fires spawning on you. Just steer clear of this game it is not worth the hassle and struggle to get anywhere in this game.
0;This company Rockstar just falsely banned a multitude of accounts for 30 days and deleting all progress of those accounts. Given that Rockstar Support is completely ignoring this matter. The best way to attract their attention is to dump a bad review on steam. Here's mine Rockstar. Enjoy your bad rep.
0;Online is funny but there is so many things that i just hate for bottom of my heart. First Loading times are just epic... Second daily missions are mostly fun to play until there comes capture or something where you need to get some other players to play with. You are unable to complete daily if you cant get any player to join and play the mission with you. So i had enough to day i dont care and i wont play it anymore.
0;very good singleplayervery good onlinefree online dlc since release in 2013but the developers are too greedy and if you don't cheat or spend all of your money on shark cards then you're gonna have to grind 24/7 to get anywherebad anti cheat75% of all sessions there is atleast 1 cheater
0;You go and have massive ban waves on this game remove all of my items and money even when modders are at fault so I said screw multiplayer ill just have fun with crazy singleplayer mods (tsunami being my favorite) and now you remove those because of your precious profit margins that arent even affected. What happened to you rockstar you used to be cool.
0;Haven't played in forever. Try to log in and the captcha is infinite and doesn't let me reset my password. When I finally ask to send it to my email. I never got an email. I've spent lots of time and money in this game. I highly recommend no one buys this POS game where the support won't even answer emails.
0;I was playing this game with my friend and there was a modder than 10 min later there is 100 modders in the lobby and you get money droped on you. Then Rockstar games desides to give you a had that makes fun of you when you get banned. Me and the hole lobby was banned and gaven (Dunce Hats) that makes your player look stupid. DONT BUY THIS GAME. Buy red dead 2!!!!!!!! Thanks Rockstar for 60$ down the drain!!!!!!!
0;Seriously Rockstar? Fix this. It is nothing but pre pubescent children loading up scripts and griefing everyone on the map. This game isn't even worth owning and I definately wouldn't have brought it on PC if I knew this was going to be such a significant issue.
0;payed over 260 howers just to be banned for absolutely no reason it's ridiculous because my account was reset as well doing absolutely nothing what are they think they are godas well as their support team is not very handy they just said they couldn't do anything about it
0;This game is a grind. If you like grinds more power to you. I have 700+ hours in this game 600 of which I regret so much. I'd avoid this game but I do hate to say that you missed out. There is really nothing left for this game progressing as a beginner is becoming more and more difficult by the day to the point where I'd say it's not worth it anymore.
0;It has potential. It's a good game graphics are great well optimized story is long and imersive. They just had to ruin it didnt they?The game is a massive grind. You have to play hours upon hours to get stuff and it wasnt a problem until recently. Shark cards are ridiculously expensive and the vehicles are getting more and more expensive.
0;Awfull developers. How can you ban someone innocent for 30 days after just playing the game for a few hours? The worst part is not admiting to your mistake Rockstar! Not going to play this game again unless they come forward with apologies and fix the situation.
0;At first it was a great game but the lack of mods and the frequent problems that I have performance wise in this game and connection wise had me reconsider my opinion on the game very heavily as of recent. The over reliance on microtransactions to advance in the online mode and the lack of updates in the singleplayer mode despite the length of time since it's initial release have heavily reduced my enjoyment of the game. I would have given this a positive review before but not so much anymore.
0;loading is very slow when connecting to internet even with 100mbs and good hardware. other then that it is very fun. but ive had problems connecting through out the couple years that i have owned it. the servers are complete s***. Rockstar doesnt care about fixing them. dont buy the game its not worth waiting for the servers to connect
0;Bought this game for the single player and thought it was okay I tried multiplayer once and it was an awful grind unless you submitted to the microtransaction Gods... But the modding ability and community made it a fantastic single player game until Take Two Interactive decided that actually they didn't like that so made OpenIV stop by sending a cease and desist effectively gutting a huge portion of the modding scene.I would no longer recommend this game to someone...
0;Played GTA since the late 90's. Bought every one. Have this for 360 XBone and PC. Its been sliding downhill for me with the ADHD level of DLCs but the final nail in the coffin is Take 2s recent attitude to mods. Remember when you bought something and it was yours? Remember when companies had to repsect their customers to maintain them?I wont buy another Take 2 game.
0;So first you make the multiplayer next to unplayable on public servers due to rampant hacking and then you take the fun out of singleplayer by essentially banning mods? off! The OpenIV devs did their best to prevent their tool from being abused you reward it by a freaking cease and desist!
0;the only problem in this game is too much modder and hacker legit i was playing the adversry mode occupy and a guy spawn a UFO as a shield. CAnt do anything about it. if this keeps up i might just be a hacker better than being a player plz get your act togahter and check the player action more frequently plz i love this game but this is not acceptable.
0;The F is wrong with this game? I can't host any Heist Lester didn't call me for the First Heist!I spend so much money just to buy the latest High End appartemen and this is what i got? can't host Heist at all?Great i'm just wasting my money and time just for this.
0;Best to just not even look at this game it takes to long to get cash 4 or 5 days stright of doing jobs you hardly get anything to show for it the online comunity for the game is cancer and rockstar dosent know how to do anything even set up a proper anticheat chances are within your first few days online youll be shot every 5 seconds run over blown up repeatedly by a hacker or something else the game is just all around bad at this point its a wast of 60+ gigs.
0;I never even modded the game but taking the fun away from people who mod who aren't ruining the fun of others simply to push them into multiplayer to shove microtransactions down their throat is super s h i t t y. That's about the quality of this game now. Don't buy it move on put your money towards something worth your time like the Witcher 3.
0;I''ve been playing for a few months and I've put up with ALOT of issues like the game timing out when transitioning from missions back to the main online game hackers running around with impunity and failed money transactions. It can be fun but ultimately this game is flawed and I would not recommend this game for purchase if you are interested in playing online.
0;Hackers have been ruining the multiplayer and just when I think Rockstar is going to come in and take care of it they do this. Rockstar Games and their publisher Take Two Interactive have sent out a cease and desist to the OpenIV team a group of independent developers who have kept the single player mode of GTA thriving years after the release fixing all the failings of Rockstar in the process. you Rockstar. you Take Two.
0;Although I don't mod personally I can see why people do. It creates a fun community of custom content. Because people are using these mods on single player and not buying godforsaken shark cards Take Jew interactive has decided that they can make more money by making modding illegal literally illegal.We have to stand up to this.
0;Changed price during summer sale to make 30% off equal 60 dollarsYea it includes some stupid in game money but the base product is still full price....................../ /) .................... / ../ .................../..../ ............./ /'...'/ ........../'/.../..../......./ ........('(... ... .... /'...') ......... .................'...../ ..........''... .......... _. ............ ..............( .............. ............. ...
0;Got a bunch of money by joining a modded lobby now every time I log on Rockstar 'adjusts' my cash. It's pretty frustrating knowing that I'm grinding out missions for money and may not even keep any of it. Rockstar doesn't seem to want to punish all of the players using god mode or other hacks that actually affect players negatively just people who received some cash because they're too cheap to implement any kind of anti hacking checks.
0;Open IV ruined the modding scene but Rockstar have been milking this game for years with shark cards been a dead game for ages now without money online is essentially pointless and you get banned over getting modded money due to them crying over you not spending 50 plus on shark cards.
0;Well I got banned cause one ing guy started dropping me money!! What should I do if that happened to me? Of course i instantly logged out but no I still got a ing ban for THREE MONTHS for nothing. I had level 145 some cool cars and a pretty house and now everything is gone. I dont see any point doing all these boring heists and working for 100k$/30min when these money are kinda worthless. I'm done with this game...
0;Great game...for the first few days then R* thought it would be a great idea to ban any cheat whether it is a graphical mod or not or if it is single player or online. IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET BANNED TORRENT THE GAME! I'm sorry but really i mean mods are half of the GTA experience.
0;I played this game for the first time on 4/13/15 at 9 36 PM and had the best time of my life. 5 days later I downloaded my first mod for it and it fixed some graphical issues. And recently I was banned for 15 days in a ban raid? R* the game needs mods to survive on PC. And I will not be recommending it to anyone until the mods are allowed. 10/10 &gt 0/10
0;After playing the solo game which was meh compared to earlier adaptions i tried the online play. THe community was so sad i literraly cried for 3 weeks straight and started going to church every sundaymorning which I still do. All in all the game sucks balls. After completing the ing game i finally got some millions (believe me its easier in real life... haha no its not) the only thing left to do was completely zero zilch. nada.
0;Too many HACKERS and nothing you can do about it.they can spam you with false transactions were you need the restart your game to fix it. teleport you anywhere at any time. kill you instantlly. remove your hard earnd cash (or paid with REAL money). remove your ammo. cause an errror where you will be kick to singleplayer.not a game worth playing
0;I would love to give this game a great review. Because come on its Grand Theft Auto 5 and it runs great on PC. But Rockstar is making it more and more difficult to mod. One of the main reasons I'm a PC gamer. I could do without multiplayer personally and the overpriced cash cards for the ability to mod.
0;Still a hacker infested game. Not that enjoyable anymore. items are overpriced and make the game too much a of a grind. Which is why people beg for money from modders. It shouldn't be that way All items should be obtainable by casual players with out grinding.
0;are they smoking crack? they are still trying to charge full price for this game? plus the freaking paywalls? and no dlc for the single player in like 4 years? bad form rockstar bad form i've always been a fan of your games because they are quality products but this is getting rediculous
0;Takes WAY to long to gind for money to buy anything cool. They also don't add everything multiplayer has into single player. I just wanna around with my friends with all options available Not grind over 100 hours with minimal enjoyment befor the game gets fun.
0;I was just ripped off by rock star today over 500.000 dollars on a car tha they said was free but then chargede me for thatamount. when trying to sell worthles car back they show no value. I have been a member since 2015 'Ripping off their customes seems to be their way of getting all of the money from us.They also will not let sell anything back after you spend millions in the game..l
0;DO NOT BUY THIS.Whilst playing online a hacker managed TO LOG INTO MY ACCOUNT FROM JUST BEING IN THE SAME SERVER. Also my friend was banned after a modder level him up a few hundred levels without his consent and rockstar still banned him. Rockstar is a piece of sh*t company that doesn't care about its game or its users anymore.
0;So playing through Heists to get money instead of modding it in being the good little person that I am just so that the heist finale that we were doing decides to not give anyone of us any sort of cash. Thanks Rockstar I totally am not going bankrupt because I spent my entire afternoon doing Heists and what do I get? Nothing! I can't even access that heist's finale again thanks to me having a new heist to setup. See this is what makes people mod the game to give themselves billions of dollars.
0;Great game good graphics and fun gameplay! BUT if you were holding off from getting the game and waiting to get the pc version because of mods DONT as rockstar has recently changed the EULA you can now get BANNED from modding the game. This is completely asinine Rockstar great job and go yourselves.
0;Loading Simulator 2013.I cannot belive that his game has not improved it's HORRIBLE loading screens The game is absolutly fantanstic BUT and there's a big BUT The insanly big loading is not worth a single dollar of this game by any means Thanks for upvote
0;So I was selling bunker stock alone and once I finished the sell an error message appeared saying that the game couldn't complete the transaction or something like that and I didn't get the money. This happened to me twice and I still didn't get the money for the sell back. Even though it wasn't a lot it's really annoying cuz I spent money and time to get that stock.It felt like rockstar stole from me directly
0;Game had a great single player game! The time it took to come to PC was long but the game is very well optomized and is awesome. I would recommend the game for single player only. Online which Rockstar has put all their time/money into after the release is a mess. It also caused Take Two/Rockstar to prevent any modding capabilities since they could make their way into their online mode.
0;"""I'm glad I have a second account to talk about this game. Screw Take Two for this nonsense they pulled with mods deeming them """"illegal"""" in a single player sense. I bought this game on PC *for* the mods. I own 4 copies of the game and for what? Typical cooperations blinded by the wall of money.Don't get this game or any Take Two game if you're looking to mod. Don't even give them a dime if you're *not* modding."""
0;1. rockstar focused on ing sharkcards too much2. WHERE IS THE MOTHER IN SINGLEPLAYER DLC THAT TELL THE STORY OF CJ3. to many unworthy dlc4. SHARKCARDS AGAIN ITS T MAN5. OpenIV got banned so no mod for you6. no more character transfer7. to many promises... just like my girl
0;"""This game is ridiculous the new plane """"The Bombushka"""" costs 70 ish great british pounds for a in game item thats why people go to modding and get there accounts banned and then they have to buy another account because GTA is a fun game so thats another 20 40 depending on where you buy from.Sooooo this game is trash and Rockstar is raking it in."""
0;Just want it to be known my first every GTA online experiance was with a hacker giving me cash. Only time I can say I was glad to see a hacker. But that was my initial reaction to GTA online and since then I've seen countless.Only got the PC version to get some of the awesome singleplayer mods. Shame. I'd refund this if I could. Don't buy this if you intend to mod it you'll become a criminal P
0;This game is great fun Until you start trying to enjoy yourself in freemode using the cars and planes you have bought which you earned through grinding heist after heist...... To be constantly killed by teleporting modders cheats that are immune to damage and kill you instantly... DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT THE MULTIPLAYER ASPECT! AVOID
0;After spending over 2 000 hours on this game and grinding millions of dollars for the next update Rockstar took away most of it and left me broke. I would be happy if they took away the unwanted $1 000 000 dollars that were modded but they took away an additional $11 000 000 that was legit and earned through playing the game. Don't get this game until they fix this issue with online that many people are having.
0;"""Hackers Rule the world. And not only that if you make too much money legit. Rockstar will take your cash with no explaination. Had a friend have his CRIMINAL MASTERMIND money taken from him.. over 14 million total... within minutes of finally completing the Mastermind finale. Essentially 200$ worth of Shark cards. *They have no idea how to solve the hacker problem so they delete """"suspiscious"""" money which jsut means.. if you're good at the game. you're going to be robbed by Rockstar*"""
0;This is the last GTA title I buy. I havent logged online in months on this title and Im normally on closed sessions when I play. My hard earned $ is apparently only there for later removal by an anti cheat program. Honestly Im willing to bet this was intentional those corporate hacks assume profits in the midst of this little mess like war lords gun running in 3rd world countries. Worse than EA.
0;Strange business practices and nonsensical choices have damaged this game.Targeting the Singleplayer mods as they can be ported to Multiplayer has really shown that all they really care about is the microtransactions as they don't want people hacking in money. Thier solution to ban the biggest Mod is a horrible idea.
0;simple story i play GTA online then after few min i see i kill all player in one time and all player call me hacker. do you think this funny rockstar? FUNNY? i never use any cheat or hack. we are customer. we buy your game. without customer you are nothing. yup this is awsome game but please fix your game!. i hope i never got banned.
0;i was banned once before because of a modder. a few months after i was unbanned i started playing again. in less than 1.8 hours i was permanantly banned. i didnt do anything nor will rockstar acknowledge me when i submit a ticket to be unbanned. they just give the same generic response each time all i ask when i post a ticket is why i was banned not if i can be unbanned.
0;Rockstar just commited corporate suicide let's put it this way games are the state mods the currency and rockstar the goverment well they went full communist on their policies and banned all mods so everyone has the same level of enjoyment. them commies. you take our liberty and resources away and we take your money.
0;"""If they maybe fixed the loading times or stopped people from """"Modding"""" in online multiplayer then maybe it would be worth playing. These """"modders"""" or hackers ruin the online experience but to me it seems like the amount of them have only slowly increased since the release of the game. Why is the modding community being targeted when their GTA Online environment is so flawed."""
0;If i could only play one game for the rest of my life this would be it! The best game I've ever played There is so much freedom in online mode You can do anything. One of the things I love the most is being able to customize almost every vehicle and get to become a billionaire. As well as roleplaying. With no doubt this is my favorite game )Edit I got banned for cheating in online this game
0;Online is still heavily populated with modders particularily the ones who enjoy making the entire lobbie's guns disappear. It's fun when no one has any idea who did it and the report function threatens disciplinary action against the reporter. Buy any other title and let this one die.
0;It's fun for a few hours but recent updates destroyed the online mode even more. Rockstar tries to make this game into everything that's popular but that backfired quite hard with the latest DLCs. Gunrunning was a cool idea but not well thought through.The Singleplayer on the other hand is pretty much perfect. If you don't care about the Online which I did though. Then this is an instant buy.
0;Banned for no reason.I don't understand. I didn't do anything. I just Task on normal. Was banned for no reason at all.I did not violate the ban. Also did not use or abuse the game mechanism or interfere with other player's gaming experience. I want to know what I've done.I was forbidden to log in.I have always followed the rules of the game.I want to know why.
0;Game crashes i cant get my shark card bundle i buy a shark care and it still doesnt work 3 days out. This game is great but the support sucks While writing this my game crashed again. Oh how fun it is spending 60 dollars and not being able to run your game on a bad computer.
0;Overrated game the thing is the singleplayers is fine but after the whole fiasco with take two wanting to ban mods I don't know..... ...also gta online is just a microtransaction money farm (and heck is it boring). Have not opened this game for half a year and finally completely uninstalled it.
0;one of the best things i loved about GTAV is the ability to mod offline. after hearing that Rockstar will be removing the ability to mod offline. in my opinion that was the best feature of this game. IDK why Rockstar decided to remove the ability to mod.
0;you Take Two ! They just banned moding for this game. That means single player is boring and pale. And Online mode is anyway becouse there is no DEDICATED servers only some stupid lobby system where you spent more time on loading screens than actually playing a game. Not worth buying. Lets hit them where it hurts..in a pocket.
0;After the news of Take Two Interactive issuing Open IV a cease and desist order I can no longer reccommend this game or its developers due to their despicable actions towards the single player and modding communitites. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Open IV just give it a google and it won't take you long to see just how essential it has been to the modding community for almost 10 years. Screw you Take Two. Screw you.
0;Bought the game for my alt because this account got perm banned for no reason 2 hours in my alt account gets perm banned! So far i have called rockstar support waited in a 30 min queue. Wanted to commit suicide when the representive told me the policy they have of no BAN APPEALS NO MATTER WHAT AT ALL! GG Wasted $60 dollars on another game to earn 200k and get banned GG ROCKSTAR GG. You Thieves
0;I'm not recomended this game because this what Rockstar doing with multiplayer is bad. I liked Single Player and I hate Multiplayer because multiplayer is going like Saints Row with steroids + have cheater who giving moneys and when give You moneys then You probably get baned /.I change my review when Rockstar give options to not install wasting space multiplayer crap!!
0;Rockstar support about randomly happening bans we don't care.This will happen to you.Anything will get considered as a side cheating program.Online real cheaters will eventually shower you with money and you will get banned for it.You will plea but they won't careTake your cheated money away (well i'm okay with this obviously)And when your ban is gone you will log in .. and get banned again because reasons.F* these people.
0;if you get banned on gta v rockstar are at answering questions about why like i got temp banned for greafing so a normal monday go on to gta v online load in go to garage and bang before i get to open the elevator doors i get temp banned for grefing when i call rockstar i get told they cant do anything for me so my advice dont talk or play with hackers as they will get you banned #PC MASTERACE PROBLEMS
0;I've always loved grand theft auto. I've had no problem with this game until I uninstalled it. It will not download again and I'm furious. Rockstars support sucks&gt so does steam. I wish I could talk to someone 1 on 1 but no...Do not get this game. If you want to go ahead. I do not recommend it.
0;Crap servers. I end up loading for a really long time which is really annoying. Apart from the server stuff the game's really good and fun to play with pals. Recommended for a fun time with friends but I've down voted this game due to the poor servers.
0;Just leave this game to wither and die. It's been impossible to play in Australia for so long and the developers don't give a . This game had a lot of potenial and is still fun to play but the chances of whether you'll be able to actually play a clean unbugged match is a coinflip (well more like a 20% chance). Don't buy this game. Let the devlopers get thier together or shutdown ( and I kinda hope they shutdown).
0;"""Now first off This game was great to play on the PC. It was well optimised had good graphics and was fun to play.But a game published by a company that tries to exploit their players by claiming it's """"on sale"""" by making it more expensive should not even be rated above 50%.*rage intensifies* you Rockstar I used to like this game.Please make this the worst rated game on Steam.**Yes even worse than Airport Simulator*rage ceases*"""

0;GTA V The biggest sh*t i have ever played on ps4 now i made a mistake and bought it for second time got banned for 100K modded money. Rockstar support full of bots no one can help you. Character transfers removed so i lost my 1000+ hours of playtime on my ps4 rank 296 and bought 2 shark cards. Guess what rockstar dont give a . I hope that was helpful review don't get this game if you mind to transfer from console.
0;Meh MP is boring you can't have fun without having millions of dollars which most people modded into the game anyways. The game favors high level rich modders because they have auto lock on vehicles and powerful guns yet you're stuck with a crappy sniper rifle that takes like 4 shots to kill (both cause it sucks and leveling gives you more health) meanwhile they shoot you once and you're down.If you've come for fun with friends play gamemodes and stick with em if you're playing solo. Don't.
0;Marketing juggernaut GTA V is too big to fail and has a horde of children online to squash any criticism too.Well optimized singleplayer looks great and no doubt the PC version is the best version (BEHOLD OBVIOUS TRUTH)Multiplayer is buggy as ridden with issues and absolutely dominated by hackers.3/10 major feature of the game does not perform even moderately well.
0;Single player is fun however you can't use mods unless you want to risk being banned. Multiplayer is a huge pain in the to play consistently with friends. Loading screens everywhere. This game is a really hot chick with a lot of mental issues hidden on the inside.
0;"""I wouldn't recommend investing a bunch of time in this game anymore.the Single player is fine but online play has a bunch of issues money being removed from your bank because you received money from a hacker is fine but when they remove legitimately earned money they're just saying """"don't play this game"""".So... don't play this game."""
0;3 ING HELMETS THAT DO NOTHING ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A ING SPORT CAR. HIGH END APARTMENT WITH 10 CARS GARAGE AND EVERYTHING COST 200K. A ING MOTORCYCLE WITH AVERAGE PERFORMANCE WITH BOOSTER COST 750K. VEHICLES THAT COME WITH DLCS COST AN ARM AND A LEG
0;The game is currently riddled with hackers. Every server you go on there's a 90% change there will be someone currently using mods in that server. The game has a lot of interesting aspects and eastereggs amoung other things. But the hackers ruin it for everyone. I encountered four hackers today alone most from China. I'm giving this game a 3/10 with hackers. If Rockstar would get off their asses I would give it a 9/10.
0;1) Bought game played with friends had fun and stopped for the day.2) Next day was in a 2 man heist mission with a friend riding in a car (im not driving the car) and poof banned for no reason.Note My friend isn't banned. Edit #1 Support ticket is useless. They copy and paste same sh'it.Edit #2 Banned again. Just by playing with friends for heist missions and such
0;It was a wrong move to take a step toward a modding tool that didn't actually touch multiplayer assets. Modding is the only thing keeping this game relevent. Without modding the game is incredibly lacking. Mods are the main reason this game is still relevent today. Especially in the RP communities. I can't recommend this game now due to the lack of respect Take 2 is showing.
0;The ONLY way this is fun is if you cheat in money and of course you will get banned. Basically Rockstar want to steal your money by either making you purchase thousands of real dollars in Shark Cards or by having to buy a new copy of the game whenever you get banned.They are absolutely the worst developers out there.
0;While it is one of the best pc ports out there and sets the standard for pc devs. The dispicable marketing and horrendous abuse of the steam sale system is completely uncalled for by a dev of this popularity and magnitude. Not even to mention the neglect of the game post hackers to solve it has undoubtably birthed my negativity for the game. Hence my lack of a recommendation and urge for new lookers at the game to try and buy it as cheap as possible leaving little money for Rockstar.
0;Forsure R* does not give a f**k about you after u bought the game even thoug the sharkcards . U will get banned for doing nothing ! U can try to appeal the ban but all you can get is a automatic copy respond from the system( that what happen to me) u bought all the thing but the power belong to them and they can take it from you every single ban wave ! u own nothing people . ! i repeat one more time do not buy this u will waste your freaken money so easily w
0;The game ceased to be fun especially since the price of new products is very high and make that kind of money is impossible.My opinion about this game a fully negative. I would like more opportunities to earn and only then can we play this game and get it at least some fun. 2/10 (the game disgusting)
0;Unless you've got deep pockets or just want to play the single player mode there's no reason to buy this game anymore. Rockstar is just pandering to their users who continue to purchase in game currency. Every new vehicle/item they add in the game continues to go up and up in price.
0;Used to be fun. Not much to do after you finish the story. Payouts online are ridiculously horrible. Even when doing a CEO mission your location is revealed to everyone. Even hunting a CEO doesn't get you much. This is a way for Rockstar to get you to buy expensive shark cards.
0;Used to love this game untill rockstar made it a pile of crap! Taking everything away from players that have done nothing wrong. Countless emails and phone calls to sort issues. But still no cooperation. Would not recommend this game to anyone now. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!
0;Take Two Interactive have decided that they wanted to go 1 up on Bethesda's paid modding up and completely disallow modding all together. Well that is just ing brilliant isn't it we only paid 40 pounds for your game that is years old and has not dropped in price at all since initial release. I am still at the start of the campaign on this game because I only brought it for mods you T2.
0;This game is absolute You can get banned just for some hacker gave you a money. If you try to play this game you will have to spent 5 hours trying to do a mision because matchmaking is absolute How can Rockstar expect people not to do money cheats if their missions are crap the game just doesnt work fine. This game is overall
0;Rockstar's logic 1) Single player modders are enjoying our game by making it their own with said mods? NOPE! CEASE AND DESIST !2) Online hackers roam free and steadily kill what's left of our online community? Lmao I don't really feel like dealing with that rn p
0;Let's put it simple. This is literally the worst online game ever made.The worst lobby system ever made.40% of the time in this game is waiting for it to join load or to restart because it once again broke.Cheaters everywhere.YOU get banned if the cheater is with you on the same server.It's an endless money grind to ensure rockstar sells their ing shark cards.The single player is quite fun if it the game starts at all because of their ed up DRM.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game.
0;Online is a huge grind and a money trap.There are only a handful of co op heist missions to make it worth playing.Singleplayer is meh. The technical quality is obviously there.But the content is generally uninteresting and uninspired.Also i hate waiting through countless loading and lobby screens. Just make a better UI.It is underwhelming for the game with the highest budget in the world.
0;multiplayer sucks big time I feel sorry for my kids who just spent their christmas money to get GTA 5 only to get smacked every time they play online and have modded players showering them with money trying to get them banned totally destroying the multiplayer experience
0;it is an amazing game and i have had it on the xbox360 as soon as it came out when there were funny glitches and not over priced stuff now it has got boring just constaintly grinding for money. i really dont like the game thatmuch any more rockstar stop over pricing stuff please
0;Modding is the best part of this game but what did you do for s sake!&gt Don't use mods even for single player&gt Also discord or curse when it hooks into a game via an overlay can get you banned.. (ridiculous) You know what? Go to hell Rockstar and Take Two
0;Worst. Balance. Ever. 35 special bullets for heavy sniper rifle? 11 mags 20 shots each for assault rifles? ARMORED Tampa's windows can dissapear by car crash? Screw this APB is better for now (and FREE). And with normal combination of clothes. And customisation. And woman clothes. And girls looks like girls actually. APB Reloaded remember this. Zero cost zero cheaters zero empty headed deaf developers.
0;game worked for about a week and it was awesome and then one day it just stopped getting past the rockstar social club loading screen. i cant even play the story mode.. this is why people pirate games.. maybe i should start doing that instead of giving my money to these companies. ive tried talking to their support team and theyre helpful but they dont know how to help me.. wow waste of my 50 dollars
0;GTA was a great game on Xbox and playstation but due to rock stars decisions to allow GTA to be modded on PC destroyed it. Online sessions are full of modders who are out to ruin your good time. Story mode is the only bit i still enjoy playing. Until Rockstar finds a way to implement anti hacking this game will slowly die off.
0;Dont buy this game you will get banned because there are tons of modders dropping money. And no the modders dont get banned only the victims the people who wanna play fair game but the game is ruined by the modders!!! i suggest not to buy this game because this is waste of money and time because at last your account will be banned and your profile will be wiped and even if its unfair ban the support team will just say there is nothing we can do and so go your self!
0;"""Bring back mods no one should support this awful move. It does nothing but screw over their customers in an act of greed. Their recent acts show that they care more for squeezing every last drop out of you in the form of shark cards rather than providing an open community. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone until they allow the free """"marketplace"""" for modding games that we own."""
0;What Blue Hole done is selling game then making Cheats and sell thoso cheats then baning idiot cheaters and selling game to them again and the circulation goes on.sometime like this time the game gona fill with cheaters in all servers and the game sucks.damn you Blue Hole and damn you idiot cheaters.
0;Now that Take Two has banned singleplayer modding which didnt have anything to do with online cheating (OpenIV even had preventative measures to make sure it couldn't be used online) I can with 100% certainty not recommend this game.The story was fun to play and all but...Online is a massive grind to buy literally anything (even clothes are inhumanly expensive)You could still have fun when playing with friends on a private session but thats about it.
0;Only play this game if you truly want to experience the single player or if you have a few friends to play in a private room. Every public room I've been in has been plagued with cheaters which'll prevent you from doing some fun open pvp. If you don't have 3 other friends to do heists it can be a pain to communicate to people since most of them don't speak english.
0;Its a moneygrab what can i say i bought the game at full retail price with a big shark card to start and catch up to my friends a few weeks later i get perma banned for hacking. Overall rockstar has $80 and i have nothing with them saying go f yourself. 2/10 it was fun before i got banned and its a company who has no regard for its community. I dont normaly give a bad review but this is well deserved...
0;jst buy this game heist to get some money finnaly can become ceo buy warehouse sell 3 crates for $90k now they update the game and i can only sell 4 crates for $40 k wtf bro you can no longer get money in game even if you can it takes you forever hahahahaha
0;you Take Two. you.Edit These negative reviews from the public seem to have beaten the whole issue. Rockstar issued the statement against Take Two and OpenIV is now back. Yet I still hate Take Two. And I stand by what I said.I'm not changing this review or editing it unless another development on the issue happens.
0;Good gameplay although the story characters and physics are a downgrade from the previous game. The modding is the main attraction of the game for me since I have no interest in Online so the recent attack on the modding community by Take Two has forced me to leave a negative review.
0;The most expensive shark card for $99 that gives you 8mill wont even cover the cost of a 10mill plane in game.If you don't want to spend real money for ingame money you could always grind missions that pay 10K for a week straight so you can maybe buy something nice.
0;my 3rd review.not a surprise that gta has gone down hill.singleplayer is absolutely fine and maybe the only part of gta actually worth playing because online is broken and full of cheaters. servers and players.good luck trying to find enjoyment without anyone else to play it with.
0;"""Rockstar support is aids. I was browsing the military vehicles to see which ones required a bunker to purchase when i accidentally miss clicked and bought a car cause for some awful reason there isnt a """"are you sure option"""" when i reached out to rockstar to request a refund on the car they gave me a generic response. So there goes my hard earned 2 mil and this game"""
0;GTS Online Capitalism in a nutshelll.... grind for HOURS AND HOURS to get the same things the rich kids can buy instantly with Daddy's credit card.Finance &amp Felony DLC $15 million ($200 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Inport &amp Export DLC $25 million ($300 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Gun Running DLC $23 million ($300 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Smugglers Run DLC $48 million ($600 REAL MONEY SHARK CARDS)Rich kids and greedy corporate bosses at Rockstar RUIN the potential this game has.....
0;Do not buy this game anymore unless you wish to start completely from scratch. Say goodbye to your other characters they no longer support character transfer which is a damn shame. Do not waste your money if you want to play online stay on your old console.
0;Seen this a lot lately a lot of people getting banned for no reason. Some for modding but a percentage not. As far as im concerned I'm being wiped for nothing i have friends that have modded in the past *wont release names* asked them nicely to not spawn money on me or mod my cars or anything Played legit finally got the 2M from heisting properly with friends. AAAND 3 month ban Welp atleast i have time to play rainbow six now.
0;WORKING HARD TO MAKE MONEY FOR NEW GUNRUNNING DLC SELLING STUFF FROM YOUR MC AND CEO EVERYDAY FARMING HEISTS WITH YOUR FRIENDS HARDLY GET 6000000 DLC RELEASE DATE GOING ONLINE TO PURCHASE SOME OF THAT NEW MILITARY STAFF CONGRATULATION U'VE GOT 7000 INSTEAD OF YOUR ACCUMULATED FUNDS AND A NEW MOTIVATION FOR PLAYING NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO DELIVER A CAR WITH YOUR CEO TO EARN MONEY TO PAY THE BILLS AND SALARY FOR YOUR MC STAFFThe best DLC 10 wasted gaming hours out of 10. Thank you rockstar.
0;I wont even play online because of the price of everything.. 100 real world dollers will get you 8 million in game but most of the good stuff cost about a couple million anyways. So your going to spend 100$ on 1 or 2 items which is crazy. I used to respect R* but now since they went online they are nothing but crooks trying to scam their players in to spending money on their stupid shark cards.
0;200+ Hours On File 4 Years Of Online This Game Has A Wide Variety From Either A Working Your a$$ off 24/7Or B Resorting To Hacking From How Utterly Hard It Is On A Low Rank And Just Trying To Get Some MoneyI Wish I Could This Game A Thumbs In The Middle Because Thats Really What It Deserves....Still $60
0;Take 2 the company that owns Rockstar the developers of the game shut down Open IV one of the best gta 5 modding tools. Not cool take two this is complete bull This has ruined the game do not buy if you want to buy the game for modding.Bethesda pointed a gun at modding and demanded it to hand over money.Take two Killed modding off thousands of people and dumped the body in a landfill.
0;dont get me rong its a good game and fun with friends but / gta 5 support is not somthing you wone talk about and modders. poeple who dont cheat get band and modders hmmm ???? wel buy the game and find out for your self telling you. you wone get your money back BDW dont try to submit a ticken when you get band voor no reason da wil only anser with a auto msg and wond replay on ban even if its a rockstar server error
0;The game is really pay to win. I got banned (permanently) for having my offline mods enabled while in a online session even though i was afk and didn't use them at all. GG there goes my gta online experience. Remember to not use modded clients in Online. game kinda sucks without mods tbh.
0;DLC after DLC..... So mostly you get a single player game and a pay to play multiplayer game. You have to buy Shark card after shark card to keep up with the newest content. after seeing how much the stuff would cost in the latest DLC I imediatly uninstalled the game. Bottom line I want a new GTA game or I'm not wasting my time and money anymore with rockstar games.....
0;Take2 microtransactions and there corporate greed. This is the worst they have taken a game that could be amazing and turned it into a giant pile of horse Half a billion dollars in microtransactions and not new game in sight what a ing joke. GTAV Take2 Rockstar.
0;R* you really need to do something with all the hackers!!! It seems every lobby I jump into anymore a hacker does some stupid stuff like spawn UFO's in the middle of town and then blown everybody in the lobby up. This is a issue as i am FORCED to play in a public lobby as you wont let me do my CEO stuff in a private lobby. Fix your game you lazy s and get rid of all the hackers 6 Dog Bones Out Of 10
0;"""Great game horrible servers. I wanted to support Rockstar for making a great single player game I bought the game.The multiplayer aspect (servers bugs in loading screens admin service) is horrible...I can't even play the game anymore because I simply get a """"cannot connect to Rockstar servers"""" error...I tried everything to make it work...Just go and buy PUBG forget this game...it was great but now its done...10/10 keyboard breaking simulator..."""
0;Normal people don't have time to grind out missions to make money to buy anything in the game anymore. Also I'm not wiilling to throw down $100 for 8 million just so i can buy one or two items from the new DLC (cash grab). Rock star and Take two NEED to grow up and stop this t. All you do is take the money and you don't care for the customers any more.
0;I redownloaded this game I was stupid enough to buy years ago just to mod it and try to make it a little bit more enjoyable and just the day I finish downloading it and decide to get to modding it Open IV disappears. Well I'll just have to disinstall it once more wasted my time
0;Playing mostly online mode. That being said every single time you play online there is a hacker. Bullet proof rocketproof making ur character fly across the sky to a point you have to restart your game. I don't know if they stopped cracking down on hacking but to experience it 5 times a day when playing is just annoying.
0;Ruined with tons of microtransactions and way too expensive vehicles and stuff and shark cards are ay too expensive too and the game is littered with cheaters and single player mods were ruined by take2 and they should rename the game to Grind Theft Auto V
0;Overrated game.I recommend it but only on sale.+Big map+Good shooting mechanics+Good optimization Story sucks Car physics arcade af Online Matchmaking sucks (long waiting times) Servers have way too few people for such a big map Customization is very limited Full price even though it's 3 years old
0;Singleplayer Yes.Multiplayer No.And multiplayer is the bigger more important aspect of this game according to Rockstar.Reason https //www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/5aqtql/falsely_banned_in_gta_online_my_experience_with/TL DR False bans and Rockstar.
0;This shameless Take2 moneygrabbing needs to end. I am now boycotting ALL GAMES Take2 is involved in untill they decide to reinstate mods for atleast single player modes.For me mods are about freedom and creativity. They took that so they could pile on the 3 billion dollars they already made off this game which is enough to run a small country. How much is enough?!
0;Too afraid to play because everyone is getting banned for using simple fix mods or for no reason. You really ed up now Rockstar you really ed up.**Update***How about instead of being greedy money grabbing bastards you fix the hackers running about and causing absolute havoc on the innocent players.
0;I absolutely do not recommend this piece of trash game The PC Version of GTA V lived from mods and now you take them away? Well done you just shot yourself in the head with that one RockStar. Have fun with all the negative reviews and bad press your gonna get ing idiots.
0;One of my favorite games ever created but until Rockstar starts giving a about it's players I can't reccomend it unless you want to play singleplayer which is great. Been playing since 2013 Xbox 360 got ed while taking a in a public lobby and I got a 30 day ban and my 4 year old online character reset. Rockstar.
0;Single Player is the best at least no rockstar junkies and noobs are at you i was currently enjoying multiplayer and buying money cash cards from the store and then all of a sudden they say you have been banned for exploiting money like wtf you cant do anything right so i think rockstar should sort there stuff out a bit overall the single player is the funnest
0;Take two I know! Lets remove OpenIV all our fans will love it!*Charges OpenIV Developers*OpenIV Developers Guys were sorry but we cant do the Mod anymore.Everyone TAKE TWOAnd i agree with everyone else.Game The game is amazing i really do love it.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;Stupid developers can't prevent the hackers from ruining the gaming experience for normal gamers . I love GTAO but this game is full of hackers I'd not recommend anyone to buy GTAO rather suggest the people who wishes to buy this game not to waste money for it.
0;"Bluehole? More like . this piece of game that the developers have neglected to the point of retardation. Get skins more maps throw goddamn tomatoes but heaven forbid we actually fix the rampant amount of cheating. you. In all seriousness. Dont bother buying this game if you already haven't. Wait for ""Isle of Nyne"" to come out and this game will disappear quicker than a hyped up Ubisoft game."
0;The Multi Player is basically the main game and is one big pay to win scene. That reason alone is enough reason for me to downvote the game. The Single Player (story mode) is however a nice play although it feels limited. Get the game on a discount if you can.
0;When you do the Fleeca Job in the final act the helicopter does not pick you up. We've tried like 6 times and nothing. We gave up and then rock star send me a message saying like 'leaving heist early will give you bad points' and i am like. 'hey leaving buggs will result in negative steam review points!'
0;ready for more is less GTA style? pay to win? AI NPC's popping in out of thin air when you are out of their aimbotting range? can't get basic features(?) of the game to work right but you can take a selfie with the in game phone camera? cool. cars stuck in 2nd or 3rd gear awesome. get ready to be disappointed like never before. its 2017 trump is the potus and gta v online is the best game out. get used to the future suckas. (
0;This is one of my favorite games and i can not stop playing it however. The amount of people getting banned for just playing the game and having fun is ing ridiculous. why they cant just let people play the game and if something actually seems wrong then ban them. An example of what is considered cheating is KILLING the same player over and over not just honking a horn. so get your together devs and ill change the vote.
0;This has the could have been a great game but the problem I have is Rockstar is a frankly terrible company that has no intrest in the quality of their products meaning that this game will have the worst community who will ever find that is full of modders with no greater goal than to make your life a living hell and Rockstar has thus far shown no intrest in addressing this problem nor any other they have come across after the game's initial release.
0;"""This review is for Online ModeGTA Online sessions has a lot of hackers constantly disconnects that set you instantly to singleplayer without ask for try reconnect again bugs long loading loading for everything more loading cars teleporting and laggy.i.e stupid thing Try join in a Heist lobby ok joined now try leave done without loading.Try join in a Heist lobby """"This lobby is full want join in queue?"""" no get a stupid loading for nothing."""
0;Only if you're willing to bear the terrible online missions and the cancerous community and rockstars slimy buisness greed it's immensly fun PvPing in freeroam and it's fun to play with friends but otherwise. A dissapointment for the 200m budget and the devs continuously working on online
0;The PC version just sucks. I will always hop in a lobby and theres a modder.The online mode just sucks and they do nothing to inprove it but just tell us if we wanna buy there shark cards. Rockstar why do you not use VAC you would have more cheaters banned.Story 10/10online 3/10Please rockstar improve you're game with VAC it would stop more cheaters and modders.EDIT I was banned for no reason please dont buy this
0;As is I can't recommend this for multiplayer. Cheating has run rampant and there are little to no lobbies without someone exploiting the game. Took all of the fun right out of multiplayer. Single player is still a lot of fun but it just isn't the same when only half of the game is usable without the MP content.
0;TakeTwo just sent a cease and desist to OpenIV.OpenIV is effectively the SKSE of GTA V (SKSE is needed for a lot of Skyrim mods).OpenIV isn't involved with GTA Online hacking or modding at all and only effects the singleplayer experience.This effectively shuts down GTA V modding.This is how you lose customers.EDIT No I don't care that TakeTwo's taken it back. I'm not taking this review down.
0;I never used to encounter a hacker in GTA Online until the last few months. Ever since the start of December I've been matched with hackers in every lobby. Now it's impossible to fly around peacefully without flying into stacked UFOs or even relax in my apartment without enemy tanks being spawned. Ban waves are given to the wrong people and hackers don't seem to be going anywhere. At this state I do not recommend GTA V for then Online Experience. Single player is ok however.
0;"""""""Hold on guys this'll be funny. Why don't we charge full retail price for a game but then make the online part of it near impossible to progress in without paying even more real life money?""""Can't wait for Red Dead 2 online to come out so I get to buy shark bonds"""
0;This game is like real life. Those who are trying to earn some money to buy themselves a decent apartment/car will be constantly killed camped and abused by those who swim in a pool full of money.Not to mention how horrible developers are by taking money from people that earned it legit because of modder issues.I wouldn't recommend You this game unless You have a crew to play with because it's impossible to play alone.
0;Suffering from High Inflation and low income u need to work for multi hours with ur company to just collect 1Million and u find you can t have any good stuff to buy !!!Also you just keep the game running for few minutes just to read a guide about the game you will find yourself kicked for being idle !!!
0;Take Two the company responsible for managing this game sued Open IV which is a small group that made software to allow you to customize your rides and a whole bunch of other stuff you couldn't do in game. Hence why I cannot recommend this game anymore...
0;I enjoyed the singleplayer to the max especially using HelixScripts and other hilarious mods. Multiplayer sucks your real life money up just so you can pay for their purposely overpriced items simply so you'll buy their cards instead of doing all the work. Why so many hours logged for myself? Because I do all the work instead.
0;Great single player game with a multiplayer aspect that is severely hampered by the ineptitude of the online team who would rather pump out lackluster events and shark cards rather than dealing with the toxic population of hackers. It seems every decently populated server has a hacker who would effectively sh*t on everyone else with their fun being at the expense of other players. Im fine with modding on an isolated server with your friends but how consistent this is pisses me off.
0;I really thought Rockstar would've come prepared for the PC community after their problems on release in 2013 for console. Online Servers are TERRIBLE. So many problems with framerate. It randomly goes down then up causing the game play to not be enjoyable.. I really hope they fix this. As of now I am deeply disappointed in this game!!
0;Banning people for no reason for using SINGLE PLAYER's mods... What is the point of playing it on a PC? Where is the freedom that sandbox games are supposed to give? Well... Mods are supposed to expand the life time of a game and also improve game's experience and that's just not possible on GTA V. I must say that I'm completely AGAINST ANY CHEATING/GLITCHING on ONLINE MODE since it is unfare with other players. Boo Rockstar!
0;PROS the story and overall gameplay ( in SP)CONS online is full of hackers that spawn you on hills or other things like that or give you lots of money presumably to get you or other players banned because they are bored or whatever. dont waste your time trying to report hackers because its not gonna work. You have to make like a 10 page spreadsheet of evidence for rockstar to even consider its worthy of a ban.
0;its a game for online play. You grind and grind and grind for nothing to show for it and they wonder why all these people mod the online infastructure. Because you do a 45 min job for 200k to help pay for 20k tshirt 35k pants and a 6m dollar car. don't waste your money.
0;"""Don't let the low hours fool you 300+ hrs on other portsGTA SingleplayerThe only reason I still play GTAGTA Online*Enters GTA Online gets a month ban next hour due to no reason* Laptop ver. """"good luck getting a launcher for the game ya fool"""" Rockstar PC PORT JUST PIRATE THE GAME FOR ITS SINGLEPLAYER"""
0;WARNING Do not buy if you are expecting to transfer your character from Xbox 360 PS3 Xbox One or PS4 because you can't! Rockstar stopped that feature and they also stopped the ability to use mods. Bring back the Character Transfer feature and bring back the ability to use mods.
0;"""DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP IF YOU LIKE ENJOYING GETTING BANNED FOR NOTHING! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY FROM THESE BLOOD THIRSTY COWRDS! THEY WILL BAN YOU AND CONTROL YOUR MONEY MAKING PROGRESS. JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED """"SHARK CRAP"""" AND IT COST YOUR SOUL! IF YOU DONT BUY THAT AND TRY TO MAKE MONEY ON YOUR OWN BY WASTING UR TIME AND ENERGY THEY WILL BAN YOU! FOR MONTHS AFTER MONTHS! MAY GOD TEACH THEM A LESSONS! LET THEM BURN IN HELL!"""
0;Do not buy from Rockstar anymore Besides the obvious lack in support the games they provide is filled with hackers which makes the games unplayable.1/10 The 1 I give because of the story mode GTA Online is a pure waste of time.I literally spend 60 to buy a story mode I could've downloaded from The trust in Rockstar is gone I will not make the same mistake twice.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!Say NO to Rockstar.
0;Well once again R* dishing out bans for no reason with a very vague generic email Further tickets get you the same email in the form of a support reply all calls get you the same generic response. This company is literally run by ing idiots. This game is the virtual form of Trumps America Do anything suspicious BANNED Do anything legitimate we don't like... BANNEDDo anything other than let modders kill you... BANNED
0;The game outsie of single player is unplayable. Pay to win is out of control. Griefers are everywhere hacking and ruining the gaming experience. The only ones that get banne are the players doing nothing wrong. I keep uninstalling and reinstalling wanting it to be different but it hasn't gotten any better.
0;The game at its roots had potential but then Rockstar and Take Two figured out that they could make more money by adding pretty skins and a hard grind to the game than giving the players a fair progression. Now the game has fallen into chaos with high levels with miniguns and armored vehicles killing people who only have m9s. Its a crying shame that the came had to come to this but thats what happens when a game becomes a cash grab.
0;The single player game is great but the online is absolutely awful. The game is so reliant on the microtransaction system that the grind to get the valuable items is ridiculous. As a single player game it is nowhere near worth the full $60 price tag that it has from launch. If it was on sale for $20 it might be worth it.
0;I got banned permanently instantly for no reason! I hadent played for a couple of mounths now when i return to play online? I have never cheated in a video game not even call of juty. I don't even know how to anyways to start with.I love this game to much to even want too. I guess I don't even need to worry because I will never be able to come back! Rockstar spend more time banning the worng people rather than the real cheaters out there.
0;I adore this game. I truly TRULY do. This game was almost made for me. Keyword ALMOST. As I would have LOVED to try out the Carmegeddon mod I cant do that anymore. Not with R* being unjust as with their almighty banhammer! Banning some people for hacking and ruining the Online experience? Fine I could see that! Banning people for using a simple FOV Community fix? What the actual . Quit acting like a bunch of children R* and get your together before you lose a LOT of people.
0;"""Take Two is hammering nails on modding's coffin. This cannot stand. When all the updates were adding content to ONLY multiplayer no one was complaining. Why? Because single player mods would be able to put those items in single player. I'm SOOOO sorry if it isn't everyone that wishes to grind 1 billion hours to afford a jet that used to be spawnable by simply typingg """"jumpjet"""" 12 years ago. Take Two if you want this game to survive do NOT kill off modding."""
0;It was fun while it lasted. Now you got motorcycles flying around shooting at you in the sky goinh mach 1 and everyone is just a giant bullet sponge. You still haven't implemented stock trading in multiplayer you idiots. See you in a couple years for GTA 6.
0;I gotta say this one thing that is rockstar put zero effort to control modders they just ban accounts but do nothing about the game bug itself online is completly trash just like the pubg now used to have a lot of fun but now i just want to refund this game.I will no longer play this game until rockstar do something about it.
0;online is boring from grinding to get stuff you want they needed to do is put level caps on items in game a level 1 shouldent have a lock on launcher and a level 2 who glitched for money or got a shark card shouldent owna ing hydra i hope red dead 2 online dose things differently and makes jobs that make you money are also fun dont buy for online they are about to abandon it soon once red dead 2 comes out with its online mode. and for the love of god dont buy shark cards
0;full of bugs hackers griefers kids and mostly annoying peopleexcrutiating loading times freezes and disconnectsgrindfest with no decent ways of earning moneyfreemium fook ya oversingleplayer breaking bugsmediocre FPS gameplay and controlsno joystick supportlots of disappointment and time and money wastedcan't believe this game got mostly positive reviewsthe setting is nice thought really a shame that most peopledon't get to enjoy it.
0;This game is overall fun ovce you spend over $1000 on shark cards just to get a couple vehicles other than that its just not fun to grind for hundreds of hours for and then they took away modding thats used mainly for singleplayer and managed to ruin their reputaion in less than a week. all im gona say even trump didnt fuvk up this bad. GG rockstar GG.
0;GTA Online is absolutely not recommended. Puplic mode is FULL of hackers and Rockstar do nothing again all these suckers. Sorry but not possible to play on puplic hence thumps up!!! However is GTA Online in Crew Mode very good! It makes fun and have few nice Coop missions well done. ) Singleplayer Story Mode is great. Typical GTA TOP!
0;Update the damn servers so i can spend more time playing and less time staring at an endless loop of loading screens its been how many years and i still get stuck in never ending loading screens between lobbies. seriously Rockstar!? Continually unimmpressed. maybe ill try again in another 3 months. still cant recomend this game
0;Rockstar does not care about its players. The online game is full of people cheating and modding forcing other people into cages and dumping money on them. Rockstar does nothing to prevent the real modders and cheaters they want you to buy shark cards and that is all. The anti cheat code they wrote is garbage banning normal every day users who spend money on their product. How could this be good for business? A real clusterfk you found yourself in Rockstar. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
0;Great single player but you expect that.Cess pit multiplayer. If you dont use private lobbies youre gonna have a bad time. Its a real shame the cheats/hacks/mods are so relentless online and interfere with EVERYONE in a session. Otherwise this game would be fantastic all over.Dont be a jerk. Use your mods in private with your own buddies.
0;You will find yourself disconnecting from every lobby you join and waste a whole lotta time trying to join back but the 5 minute long load screens make it a challenge to play this game where is has the same connection bugs it had since 2014. WP Rockstar instead of releasing your next content patch how about you fix your game
0;Heres how you fix gta onlinemake stuff way way way cheaper.sports cars 100k maxsuper cars 500k maxtransforming cars 800k maxfacilities and bases 1 mil maxThats half the problem of the game right there.Fix the servers and ban the modders than you have a great game here that will last a long time. But as it stands its the laziest cash cow i have ever seen in my life.
0;I loved it when it came out but the absence of ANY dlc for the SP and the overt focus on a MP has shown the greed of Take2. This has set the tone of how they wil treat FUTURE INSTALLMENTS. NOw this ban on OpenIV is jsut anti consumer. IF you cant give us story DLCs you got no job banning modder tools you greedy s.
0;Come on Take 2 do you really have to be greedy enough to milk a game that you've already made millions or even billions of dollars out of. All you are doing is get people to hate you and eventually stop playing the game cuz the only fun thing about singleplayer gta is mod now.
0;Sure the story is excellently done and the online aspect of the game can be fun even though it's extremely grindy if you don't have the disposable income to pay for shark cards. Rockstar may continue to add more vehicles to the online to keep the 10 year olds happy but they still need to acknowledge what the majority of players have been asking for. We want steam trading cards rockstar.
0;"""I ing hack rockstare are you afraid you kuks! a yuu rocker star no more candy for you! Al l my friend hate yu kuks no honor get A lyf ples! Rocker how can yu do tis no ok i vill never forgivem never forget today is sad day!"""" Rockerstar I am disapoint. I don like you anymore!"""
0;I loved Grand theft auto 5 until they turned around and killed the modding scene. I will lift this negative review when they come to their senses and revert this attack on their very own community.You've just cut holes in your pockets take two. I think i just heard a coin fall.
0;Rockstar is the stupidest game company dare I say even more stupid than EA for discontinuing OpenIV a modding platform. So sad the only reason I waited for GTA 5 on PC was to play it with mods now it's just plain old GTA 5 that we've all seen and played 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times. (
0;This series is importsnt to me. I've played it since 6 years old in 2002 starting with GTA III. I grew up on this game it it truely breaks my heart to give it a negative review.I can no longer in good conscience reccomend Grand Theft Auto V. Clyde Speed Tommy Vercetti Carl Johnson forgive me.Rockstar please lose these image ruiners Take Two Interactive. Because as long as they have ANYTHING to do with you I refuse to buy GTA VI.
0;you R* GTA modding is the only thing keeping your game alive and you royaly ed that up now. Lmao don't buy this trash if you're planning to mod the single player. Oh but god forbid all of the dll injector mods for online still work but you dont patch that. off!
0;"""Today I realised what """"Take Two"""" actually stands for. You get ed in the whilst a massive is shoved down your throat.Edit Rockstar and Take Two allowed mods again which is great but my review still stands. Online is filled to the brim with modders that make the game unplayable unless you get an empty session. Rockstar should have sorted this out by now. I guess they are just perfectly content with just releasing new content and selling more Shark Cards. I'm done playing this game."""
0;The only reason why I bought this game for the third time is for modding. GTA has a long running modding community with some great additions to the single player mode that has been abandoned by Rockstar and Take Two for ages. You won't be able to push us all to the online version filled with micro transactions.
0;No modding in singleplayer allowed while online nothing is done against the lobbys full of hackers. Play legit earn some money and get it taken away if youre unlucky to be with a hacker in the lobby. But hey you could always buy sharkcards to satisfy Take Twos hunger for more money. Bye felicia
0;All of my hours are online play. This game is 10/10 I love getting perm banned for no reason and then when you go to try and ask why you got banned they just tell you that there are many way that a person could be banned which I did none of them. The online support sucks if you can call them which may take a while they are pretty chill sometime and are helpful. But the Online support sucks.Thanks R*10/10 Uninstall Button works10/10 Support
0;Taking away the ability to mod this game makes it virtual sh!t its no longer fun or realistic and the developers and take2 need to fix themselves. Seriously the base game isnt fun after only a couple hours unless you mod some cool effects and weapons in.
0;I REALLY ING HATE THIS GAME. I just got banned for 30 days and I didnt even do I'm not a hacker trying to get sympathy I dont even know how to ing install mods. I logged in it said i was banned and that all my would be reset. GTA VI is not gonna be in my library at all nor will i ever spend money to buy fake money on this game
0;Don't buy this game unless you just want to play and mod on singleplayer only. Online theres to many modders that ruin the fun for others and i got permantly banned because of a random modder framed me by killing everyone under my name i reported it to rockstar to unbann me but they won't do anything.
0;i'm just going to drop some complaints here memory leak lack of single player DLC you can at least get some activities you can do and vehicles in online to SP speaking of Online online full of unbanned modders loading time combined with memory leak makes the time window you have to enjoy the time even narrower the shameless promotion of shark cardsif you want to get this game get it in a massive discount or a free event(if thats possible)
0;trying to make money on gta online is really hard. the jobs you do dont make you enough money. everything is pricey. you could be playing for 8 hours and make about $100.000. but you buy one thing and all of that money its gone. If you have lots of money. rockstar will think you modded and they will take all that money away and leave you with nothing. This game was good . but not anymore.
0;Very fresh and exciting!!! This will take some getting used to though!UPDATE Go die taketwo and rockstar I play singleplayer with mods and you take away my fun I had without that stpuid multiplayer drama. Forget you and the riches you made from your bland game that was only fun for a week without mods.
0;The singleplayer is excellent don't get me wrong but the multiplayer (while fun if you have a decent amount of in game money) is blatantly based off of a free 2 play business model. Seems like Take Two really loves their whales. Not only that but modders run rampant online and they have since the game first launched. Keep that in mind before you decide to purchase this game.
0;Why did so many people buy this game? To mod. What did Rockstar do? Remove the biggest modding program the game has trying to make people pay more for micro transactions after being the 4th best selling game of all time all they want is more money and removed the ONLY reason people bought GTA V multiple times. Nerd3 sent me here and I urge everyone else who has loved to mod to give this game a negitive review because thats the only way they'll listen.
0;"""Take two just essentially banned modding for this game because they said (Paraphrasing) """"They are under monetizing their users"""" Basically not using enough micro transaction to milk their player base. And the only way they can increase the monetization is by getting more players into the online segment where you can buy in game cash."""
0;With the modding scene shutting down because of the take down of open4 there is no reason to buy this game the online section is a micro transaction hellhole and the parent company taketwo are trying yo ruin the singleplayer so you have to pay for things in online due to this i am no longer planning to get borderlands presequel and squad when they go on sale because taketwo owns those games aswell. . Take. Two.
0;i bought this game to mod and because take two is too greedy to care about their players. ive wasted my money. Dont buy this game and boycott take two until they let open IV back. Also sign this petition https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv
0;I have only one thing to say pray the demons away from GTA V!!! Exorcizamus te omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica potestas omnis incursio infernalis adversarii omnis legio omnis congregatio et secta diabolica.Ergo draco maledicte ecclesiam tuam.Secura tibi facias libertate servire te rogamus audi nos.
0;the single player is cool but not updated. gta online is in a critical state right now OpenIV the actual ban wave of legit players the mechanic they added in car handling files recently... there are way too many reasons to not buy this game now extremly long loadings getting stuck in loadings lobby system P2P... a lot of wasted potential this is way too much now i can't recommend this game anymore.
0;The game was fun and ran fine until the newest patch 1.28 came out. Now it's hard to get even a stable 30 fps on the lowest settings possible. I have a gtx 960 from evga which runs most games beautifully. It runs the witcher 3 with ultra settings smoothly without any hitches. But in GTA V this latest patch completely destroyed performance with my fps dropping into the single digits so low that the game is unplayable. Until this is fixed I do not recommend buying this.
0;"""#RIPMODS UPDATE The issue is resolved as far as I know.""""Why's yer review still negative?""""Because why are we only slinging our because of THIS bad thing they've done? Why not throw for the greedy money grubbing used in Online play? Why did we draw the line at mods? How bout we get the mutiplayer we and the game deserve? micro transactions. the grind. Give us the best game get the best reviews."""
0;terrible not the game but i have a good computer that can run everything on high but this just happend online and story takes about 40 minutes to load and i have great wifi and when i get in the game crashes or lags really bad sometimes when i tab out it brings me to a black screen causing me to restart my pc wish game actually worked
0;"""Even though I spent quite some time playing this game and thought it was """"good"""" no I just think it is complete trash I mean making modding illegal? Are you ing serious? It was the main selling point of this game and you decide to remove it? Take two just can't admit that their game is trash without modsOpenIV will always have my support."""
0;The game is not even about skill or hours put into the game anymore. It's about who put most money into the game. You can do a heist prep only to get killed by somebody with an op armored vehicle that shoots rockets. When they're on foot you're most likely able to kill them as they got no skill but as soon as they enter their tank (which requires 10 rockets to be destroyed) you're ed.
0;2k games are trying to crush the singleplayer users by sending a cease and desist order to the mod OpenIV in order to force more people to use multiplayer for new content and therefore milk them for more Micro transactional income. Disgraceful tactics. Do not buy this if you intend to mod it.
0;"""Fun at first the single player is about what I expected from GTA. But after wrongly having most of my funds removed online for """"manipulating other player levels and money"""" and then being treated like a piece of meat from their support I cannot in good faith recommend this to anyone unless you get it for free."""
0;You need to have high amounts of money in online which has encouraged way too many hackers in public lobbys Online missions are forced to public lobbys only so that content is gone unless you're luck enough to not have a hacker in your server. unless you find getting blown up over and over again by a script kiddy don't bother with this game.
0;Since launch they have steadily gone in a single direction.And that direction is straight towards the bottom of a garbage bin called GTA 5.I can't think of a single good thing they have managed since I started playing that can even try to counteract the pathetic excuse of game management they have attempted at.
0;Take two is ing over the community by being greedy scum lords. They are biting the hand that has fed them. If you own a product you should be allowed to use in your own way as long as you arent hurting others. ie. hacking online. If you just want a ing grappling hook or to be able to play as jesus then why the shouldn't you be able to. take two. their greed. just for the love of god don't blame rockstar
0;As a person who does not and has not used OpenIV in the past even I can say what an absolutely horrific and abhorrent decision it was on Take Two/Rockstar/etc's part to target OpenIV. What a complete cop out and lazy action. If this is how they handle their user base then the message is loud and clear they do not want my business. I'll make sure I don't give them any business ever again.
0;Story Mode Boring No one plays itGTA Online People only play the game for Online So frightening that it has so much less than story mode You need money for absolutely everything Its impossible to get money Public servers are full of s Too many other flaws to point out
0;"""you take 2. we pay 80 dollars for the mods and you just ing shaft us by killing like 2 thirds of the modding communityso if you want to """"support the modding community"""" off with the cease and decists with open iv because they arent the ones using it for malicious reasons its the people that hack open iv to allow mods on multiplayer not open iv just make a pre game check to see if theres any mods and just disable online entirely for thoes people ez pz kill me pleasy"""
0;The open world nature of the game is great driving around shooting running people down all the stuff you would want in gta is fine for me though that's where the greatness stops. The failures to connect to the gta online servers through 2 seperate internet connections constant grinding for money with most items ingame overpriced and bugs ingame that still to this day have not been fixed have me seriously questioning my decision to purchase this game in the beginning.
0;Decent GTA overall but Online is a grindfest for the smallest items. R* wants you to buy some virtual cash. You don't. You mod instead because thug life. Then you get banned because thug life. Then you come back after your 2 week ban and enjoy the stuff you cheated to get because thug life. This isn't what I did I swear. Thug life.
0;I will never buy a rockstar game again. Moved my computer to the front room to play on my big screen and it won't let me play the game in offline mod. It said it has to have the Internet to authenticate. Wow I've already authenticae and played for a few week but soon as it don't have Internet it don't work. If it was a subscription service i would understand but when you buy something it should be your.
0;Never playing again and unistalled it to. Tried playing last night and the same person joing my lobby and keeps killing me i switch to a diffrent on and he follows and does the same crap he allways knows when i get on to never playnig this crap again. Thanks jessie go ing kill your self
0;Yesterday in GTA Online i felt hungry so i drove up to the burger shot take out to order two number 9's a number 9 large a number 6 with extra dip a number 7 two number 45's on with cheese and a large soda.Game decided that i was being a fatty and banned me for a month10/10 Would get banned again
0;Played around 1200+ hours of this game never modding or using exploits bar some of the clothing exploits. Just received a notification that I've been banned and had my account wiped for something I've never done. tar and their greedy parent company Take Two would do well to stop banning people for no reason and fix their tier customer support.
0;Gameplay aside... Optimization is terrible. Online services and reliability are terrible. The game can be fun when it works. I would recommend the single player for a run through but play the multiplayer at your own risk of ruining a halfway decent experience.
0;It would be nice to do CEO and Biker gang stuff in a private lobby with friends instead of being ed over by some flying around in a jet because he has nothing else to do. And yeah the hacking scene in this game is beyond ed every lobby I join there is some Russian or Mexican guy hacking
0;Product received for free. Why are lobbies always full of a million players making it IMPOSSIBLE to do ceo and bunker stuff along with lobbies with modders and hackers. Loading also takes A F*CKING WHILE.There should at least be a way to fix thisBut no its RockStar so they dont give any about us but our money.
0;This game is amazing and after 300 hours in this game I would usually recommend it. Although for some reason my entire account including my game somehow dissapeared and I do not event have a social club account anymore. Rockstar support was no help at all saying that I didnt have the game purchased. I am forced to create a new steam account and rebuy the game if I ever want to be able to play it again.
0;Guarenteed modders/script kiddies in every lobby.This was an amazing time a while ago but stay away from GTAO. While there are opportunioties to grind out all your cash that's all it is. GTAO is a mile wide and an inch deep. T2 doesn't care anymore and neither should you.
0;Use to be good but then they just gave up on the community to change the game into a money machine with no regard for the players.Not to mention the C&amp A order on OpenIV which basically stopped modding in the game (online or Solo)I understand the reason for not wanting modders in Online as they ruin the game but all that people who mod in single player are trying to do is to get some more gameplay out of this dry game.
0;There's very little that can be said. The hacking is so insanely rampant in this game that it is borderline unplayable. I have just switched sessions 4 times only to find hackers disrupting the gameplay in all of them. It is horrific. Absolutely do not buy if you are hoping to play online. Despite a pretty good platform there is no fun to be had.
0;Pros Great storyCons Online is just a money business. I really regret buying this game and spending time online..If you expect crazy stuff like the trailers...sry but it will not happen... however if you have a lot of money (real money) buy some shark cards and enjoy the out of it
