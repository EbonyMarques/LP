0;Had a ton of fun with this game for awhile until they released Freddy. Freddy isnt only game shatteringly broken he completely drains all the fun out of the game absolutely refuse to play any survivor until they actually do something about Freddy. Instead of pretending the slight tweaks they did as a 'nerf'. After weeks they still refuse to fix him. Would NOT recommend in it's current state.
0;At first i liked the game a lot but recent DLC's just take away the fun. Overpowered killers and a toxic community Bugs and Hosts with always 250+ Ping make the game 'exhausting'. 9 months ago i would've upvote it.. But the way it is right now rather not. Grab it if it's in sale because i think the standard pricing for the game itself &amp DLCs is way too high. GIve it a try and make yourself a picture of it.
0;Dead by Daylight aka Dead by T.w.a.t.s is a r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d game made by potato brains. It's full of kids and incompetent devs that instead of fixing their 'made by paint.exe' game bugs they ban you for them. There is an ocean of bugs like texture ones map bugs design bugs and a long etc.... but nah it's better to let the players 'swim' in those and instead of fixing them the devs penetrate their dirty d.i.c.k.s in your a.s.s.
0;GARBAGE. TRASH. POORLY CODED GAME. CRASHS AS MUCH AS IT RUNS. DEV'S PUSH OUT NEW DLC (PAY TO WIN) KILLERS BEFORE BALLANCE OLD ONES IN AN ATTEMPT TO MILK THE 'USEFUL IDIOTS' OF THER $$$. YOU ARE BETTER OFF HUFFING PAINT THAN PLAYING THIS PIECE OF TRASH. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A NICE IDEA BUT IT IS FAILED GARBAGE AND THE ONLY PEOPLE CALLING IT GOOD ARE JUST TRYING TO JUSTIFY THEIR TIME AND $$$ SPENT ON IT.
0;Great game HOWEVER do NOT spend money on killers. You will only be able to play about 2 games as a killer as you will constantly receive a 'No network connection' error every single time. If you want to play survivor it will work 100%. Playing as survivor every single time gets repetitive and draws me away from the game.
0;Its the worst thing you can imagine since its a 'fun' game to play with ur friends yet in a few hours in the game you can lose everything u grind for it . Not only talking from me but lots of persons lots their data because of the game it self so i don't recommend buying this game not only for the data but for the bugs the killers are the server etc etc . for a game that have more then 1 year its pretty bad
0;A lot of bugs i do not recommend buying it cause the developers make it worse and worse by every update. I tought to myself i will ignore the bugs and stuff but this game is WAYYYYY more terrible by every update comming . If you consider playing it with a mate be ready to wait for 3 years .
0;All the developers had to do before 1.0.4 is to fix remaining bugs. Not only some of them haven't been fixed yet but within the newest update the gameplay has been ruined and the only cool thing about the recent update is new outfit but that's it. Totally imbalanced and not worth playing anymore.In the current state I don't recommend this game to anyone. Uninstalling and rating negative.
0;Day 1 and a lot of server bugs. Give it time to see if they fix the lobbies and dropped connections (right now getting a game going is terrible) and add in some quality of life improvements like muting the lobby music and I might change my review. Until then meh.EDIT Almost a year later. Logged in to see what has changed. Lobbies still suck. Survivors still trolling killers until they DC. Lobby music still annoying AF. Uninstalled. Guess I'll give it another year.
0;Dodgey and crap security is terrible loads of campers i report but dont get banned. That includes swearing farming and other abuses load of those idiotic people do. My word to anyone who wants to buy this garbage it is a waste of money. The devs should lower the price and highten the security because i have loads of people abusing me so i report them but dont get banned. The flippin vids aren't even game footage.
0;Don't recomment to buy full prince. This game is buggy 30% of time when I join lobby I stuck on loading screen. Event Thingies become useless after event ends and wasted bloodpoints what you can't ignore or go way around them.Unbalanced matchmaking. Lazy devs are lazy.
0;Dont buy. Not even for little money. This game is the most toxic game every created and in addition got a highly toxic community. Avoid this game by all means !!! On top of this the devs are idiots and ruined a good game idea. The game is annoying and unsatisfying as the killer and as survivor
0;Dont waste your money on this trash game. The creaters are stupid because they removed infinites and nerfed survivors. But the funny part is they still have not removed iron grasp or nerfed it and they still have not nerfed the killer so this game should be better because the killer is to overpowered
0;All the bugs disconnections and frozen menu screens really take you out of the game. Not what I expect when I pay for a game... If it doesn't do what it's supposed to then it shouldn't be released. Please fix the broken game that we all payed for. Thanks! Update 1 year later... Can't even play the game... always crashes with no fixes available... thanks alot for the wasted money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
0;Game would be great if developers give right rules in game. Killers can use unsports behaviour to win which we survivors cannot counter. Campers and tunellers in game more than 70% of games were played with toxic killers. If developers still let killers play like this this game will be trash. For now i don't recommend this game to anyone.
0;Good game the developers are fucking stupid. They give us DLCS instead of fixing game breaking bugs that cost many players such as myself to get completely reset back to level 0... ON EVER FUCKING CHARACTER. People grind countless hours on this game and the fact that you can get reset at any moment is bullshit. Would not recommend buying until the devs fix their sh*tty game...
0;Except when you get in a game where its laggy as hell and u just jump around while running. You get stuck on walls when you tried to turn and end up dying..... fix that and there will be a better review have a way to vote out for the lag on the game... so stupid i lost ranks cus of that
0;I think the game loses much of its value when it stops being scary. At about 10 hrs of gameplay you can see the flaws come out. While there is nothing with this type of gameplay out there on the market I feel like the game is a long way from its potential. Bugs glitches salt toxic community if you like this game you're not looking at the comment section.
0;Above average design but persistent bugs and a sadistic toxic community have destroyed this game. As decent players have moved on to other games the community has only continued to get worse. This stays in my library in case friends want to play with me but I will never pay another dime for content.
0;Absolutely hate this game the game mechanics sucks the devs are stupid and WHY THE HELL IS CAMPING A TACTIC?! the killers are all to tryhards the teams are sometimes i would rather play Friday the 13th than playing this crap. If i would recommend this game atleast they can do is make the ga e FAIR enough. But sadly i'm going to give it a not recommended game. Don't waste your money on this game.
0;At this stage I cannot recommend this game.DEVs are moving extremely slow. Either they are one of the following incompetent lazy or just not caring. It's been a year now since the release and they did almost nothing except empty promises. So many bugs still not fixed...
0;Awful game still full of bugs... Got to the end of the round and i froze right infront of the open gate and my character froze. I couldnt move and as the moster put me on the hook and i died but it kept me in the game. I had to leave the match and got none of the points i got for turning on mnost of the generators and opening up a gate. These guys arent fixing these horrific bugs SO DONT BUY WASTE OF $20.
0;Creators of this game are stupid es. THEY CANT IN BAN PLAYERS WHO CAMPS. WORST COMMUNITY EVER. WORST BALLANCE EVER.WORST REALIZATION. BAGS. LAGS. STUPID CAMPING S. STUPID BAN SYSTEM IT NEVER WORKS. OK YOU SAAY THAT THESE PROBLEMS ONLY ON LOW RANKS? NO! ABSOLUTELY IN NO! THESE PROBLEMS ARE ON ALL RANKS!I HAD 8TH RANK AND I KNOW.SO I DONT WANNA BEAT AROUND TE BUSH THAT IS WHY I CAN SAY FINAL VERDICT THIS GAME IS T AND THIS GAME FOR STUPID USELESS CREATURES
0;Day 1 and a lot of server bugs. Give it time to see if they fix the lobbies and dropped connections (right now getting a game going is terrible) and add in some quality of life improvements like muting the lobby music and I might change my review. Until then meh.EDIT Almost a year later. Logged in to see what has changed. Lobbies still suck. Survivors still trolling killers until they DC. Lobby music still annoying AF. Uninstalled. Guess I'll give it another year.
0;Definition of pay to win. Multiple Killers that are locked behind DLC and multiple survivors locked behind DLC. Locking gameplay behind a pay wall is pay to win. Oh also the game is an unbalanced joke and has been since day 1 The idiots making this game don't deserve your money lol
0;Probably the worst game I have ever played. Its fun at first but once you get use to the controls you realize the game is jsut 110% luck that's all it is. Anyone who says different is delusional. Community is garbage like most it's full of obnoxious cretins who'll just spam the chat with insults.
0;Servers are laggy especially when in Competitive. Not to mention the fail competitive system. When someone leaves in the first 10 seconds (or even later) the game is not cancelled or you don't get a bot to help out. If you like frustration this is the game you want.
0;After so much time spent in this game i can say for sure.Don't play this gameYou can be the best player you can do everything right you can just follow the basics your team will crush your hopes and dreams when you try to achieve something cool.And they allow semi pros and lower ranks to join ranked games ing absurd
0;I dont understand this game. Everyone plays 10 placements and get down bottom to prospect 1. So why have placements when you start from bottom anyway?I just hate that i must now wait couple weeks to get nice balanced matches. Its not even funny to have newbies and legends in same match!Its in the sale you can buy it now but dont waste your time on now. Do something funnier for couple weeks...
0;There is absoluitely shocking amounts of server lag if you are thinking of buying this game do not... at least until they sort it out.My ping is 26 (easily low enough) and my car slides all over the place with the disconnect symbol appearing. TL DR DO NOT BUY until they sort the servers out.
0;This game is cancer. Servers are so poorly maintained it made my mother divorce my father and made my dad kill himself. The auto ban system made Donald Trump win the Presidency. This game gives loser bubbles to all the kids giving them Bull hits like Bernie Sanders giving away free I get no bubble and my car misses the ball and the boost by 1mm and i slit my wrists a little deeper. This game is why ISIS hates America. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. Me 0/10 
0;Matchmaking is terrible. You regularly get 20ms ping players paired with 200 800ms players while the game is unplayable above 100ms ping. This happens in competitive 1v1 as well.I don't recommend this game.Update since season 4 matchmaking is super slow. Expect 5 minutes between games instead of 30 seconds.Update ... and a rank reset again. Every season (say every 2 months) you have to earn your rank again and end up terribly matched for about 50 games.
0;This game is so bad i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself also un installed 44 ping but game keeps skipping not my graphics card or anything.
0;ing gambling worst game ever created it requieres so much precision that you will loose always at least 7 of your 10 games played a day or 3 of 5 games a day.the 1 vs 1 is even worse as the only factor that mades you win is Luck doesnt matter how good you are at this game.This game has very poor physics. Making you loose most of your games.
0;I played this game about 200h and i realised that my life is worst than it was. i should be rising star or higher but everywhere is a hacker in every in' game. just dont buy it. EVERYWHERE HACKERS AND IN' KIDS. Not recommended at all. 'Rage League' 19.99$
0;As a player from Western Australia the lag makes it really frustrating to play at higher levels. The slight lag is enough to make you miss an occasional shot and this is a pretty big f*king deal when you are playing with other really skilled players. NEED SERVERS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA!!
0;Fuck this Game. In 2 days playing i get like 1 time Wasteland Map and 2 times Tokio Map. So when they handle that like this my thumbs down will stay .Edit Thanks developer for ruin the game by listening to the kiddie community and thank your for the last update every second game laggs.
0;Please stop with all the DLC you are ruining the game. At least include the new stuff if you have to make new cars... its annoying to have to pay to have all types of paints and .. i mean come on i paid 20 ing dollars for this small car soccer game at least give me what i ing paid for... i hate dlc...
0;literally the worst game I've ever played. Let me edit this real quick. Literal ing garbage. No way to add friends no remediation for ranked game leaves quite possibly the worst ing match system available... it is punitive and broken. Unplayable mess of complete and utter t. Do not buy. DO NOT BUY
0;Game is the shitest pile of crap with full on V neck sweaty cucks who have dorito's sitting on their router and can't even bend over to reach their toes. People that sweat out and get pit stains in this game make me sick. The best bit is when you intentionally get blown up by the crappy s who would be better off ended KYS SMH.
0;I hate this game with a passion on the top ten things I have wasted money on in my life this is on that list right below a lottery ticket. Its not the graphics or anything about the game except the human element within this game sucks. If I could get a refund I would delete this hot mess out of my life.
0;This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Ever hit a ball so hard it moves backwards? Now you can. In this game the physics are fucked. The driving and car styles are absolutley horendous. There like some kind of Tonka toy a kid would play with. Save yourself $20 and go buy an 8th of weed and enjoy life without this so called 'game'.
0;this stupid ing game.. it was HARD ENOUGH TO RANK UP WHEN IT WAS BY POINTS BUT NOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO GOING UP IN A DIVISION AND EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN DIVISON ING FIVE YOU CAN WIN 6 GAMES AND NOT GO UP A DIVISION AND THEN LOSE ONE ING GAME AND GO BACK DOWN. 
0;Worst game I've ever played hands down. You looking for teamates? You've come to the right game. Because every game you play we promise to hook you up with Abdul from India who get 300+ ping and a kid name yourmom69 who is absolute dog at the game. I've been stuck in gold for about two months because my teamates game after game drag me down ranks. The only reasonable gamemode is 1v1 because you cant get teamates you get opponents. Fix the ranking system and fix the players.
0;crap game so fustrating nothing drops played 12 hours since update no crates wat a load of crap wen they do its players chioce great pay to get gud stuff like usual makes the game no fun well done. mate has played it for about 3 hours today an got 3 new crates yeah great system and matchmaking still crap cant play unranked as 75% of games get cancelled wasting your time pointless.
0;Most of my hours are idled I haven't ever really played this game. So I'm doing the tutorial today playing as killer on the third or fourth tutorial bug where I'm stuck in a tree and can't move. Can't restart keyboard working fine I have to exit the tutorial now I must start from the beginning yeah bye uninstalled.Also there are barely any graphical options and the stupid game is capped at 60fps? I have a 144hz screen that's useless to me. Why the hell is this stupid game so popular?
0;One step forward and two steps back. Game was working great for a while now it seems like I cannot join a game without one or two people disconnecting. I've been kicked from a few games myself before the match starts. Needs work on connection stability or at a minimum if someone gets kicked off the game should adjust the number of generators required to escape. Come on devs you're better than this.
0;Play this game with four friends if you want to play lobby simulator. We never find a game with for people. We either have to be in a twos or a threes. This is a great game and fantastic concept behind it. However when you can't play with three of your other friends it's irritating. I do not recommend this game to anyone.
0; This is the stupidest ing game I've ever played in my life. The matchmaking system is wack and the hitboxes on everything are broken. Good survivors against noob killers and good killers against noob survivors. How does that make ANY ing sense? Don't buy this game.
0;Ranked games are unplayable people keep ragequitting without being punished. MM is broken. Peer to peer connection so if the host is downloading porn you basically can't play. With all the money they got from selling this game they should do more then something about these problems i'm disappointed.You can have a lot of fun with friends that's the only way you can enjoy the game.Looks like this game is still in beta but the major problem is the community totally sucks.
0;THIS IS NOT A REAL RELEASE BUT MORE LIKE AN ALPHA VERSION! If you wanna buy some alpha and to become a beta tester you are welcome. Otherwise stay away from this game. It crashes lags throws you out of lobby out of game etc. You lose your inventory items your points. It's simply completely unplayable.I REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PIECE OF GAME!
0;Terrible game can't find lobbies more of a bug than a game no point in playing as a killer because survivors are overpowered and the servers are utter trash i usually have to play with around 200 ms which is not good compared to other games i get around 25ms in
0;Terrible game! When you exit the game there is a chance of simply just losing rank! Community games are a nightmare! Russian players as usual will start to insult you in the chat Russian words some players start to squat once dumped a pallet! Just a disgusting game... That why i hate this game
0;Terrilbe game. I played survivor got rank 10 play 5 games was back and fourth. then 5 games in a row got camped then after I started tilting i took a break I played another game and took 10 minutes to find a game that was 3v1 and got cammped the whole game again. I took another break and tried one more time and play a FREAKING 1v1 !!! THAT IS THE DUMMBEST EVER! you guys could fix this game so easily man ! but you guys are lazy and dont want to fix it! that
0;The Devs are completely out of touch with how to balance their game. Negative review based on what was said on the stream as well as based on the nerfs they keep throwing to killers while unnecessarily buffing survivors.The game should be hard for survivors. Not comfortable. Get your heads out of your asses.
0;This game is a piece of lagging and unbalanced game I don't recommend buying it because 90% lagging (to the point where it's literally unplayable because of the killer) matchmaking (rank 20's with rank 1's or matching you with someone from Korea when you live in Central Europe the classic ) )
0;This game is a steaming pile of should have done more research on it before spending the money for it. The devs are a ing joke the forum is run by ing idiots and the game is so toxic you get cancer and die the moment you double click it to start the mother er...Don't buy this piece of it will only bring you pain with devs that don't give a about you and forum mods that act like children... The game is craptastic
0;This game is full of funcking idiot camper killer and egoist survivors.But an easy way to win this sht game you need just to download as killer and the survivors get laags and leave easy win.If you find some people mid on day and not mid on night . shit game shit people with no skill and to much friends
0;When i play as a killer.it usually shows me that 5 survivors are in the game then my game crash. what the hell is this?I sent the report bug like 10 times and it still crash after many minor patch.When do you really gonna fix this? It really me off.I have lost many pips due to this kinda of crash.
0;YOUR GAME IS ING 1HRS I CAN PLAY JUST ING ONE GAME GO DOING WHY YOU DON'T ING FIX YOUR ING IDIOT SERVER ZONE WELL CAN YOU GET MY ING MONEY BACK ? YOUR GAME IS ING PIECE OF I'M SO DONE THIS ING GAME PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR? ING IDIOT ALOT OF WORDS GO FIX IT AND GIVE BACK MY ING 19.99$ ING DUMBASS
0;dear god.......the queues for this game are absolutely horendous....this is no exaggeration.....i'll try to play as a killer and sit waiting for a group for over 5 minutes........ if i want to play as a survivor though i get a group in 3......... the queue times really need worked on or the player base expanded right now because the queues are so long its not even worth playing.
0;listen this is a great game so fun i really well reccomed it but the only problem is it crashes all the time for me and its always mid game so i would definetily make sure ur computer is very well beacuse if not u can taek the risk i took and lag and crash
0;this is a so much cancer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and i have tumors that i can feel on my back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!they are not creators of good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i uninstall this because 1.the killer is ing invisibile 2.the event is bugged!!!!!!!!!this is not okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it doesn t deserve twenty euros!
0;Why are lobbies always full of a million players making it IMPOSSIBLE to do ceo and bunker stuff along with lobbies with modders and hackers. Loading also takes A FUCKING WHILE.There should at least be a way to fix thisBut no its RockStar so they dont give any about us but our money.
0;This game is terrible the community of players is pretty bad the hacks are WAY out of control. Even if it is in its pre alpha it appears the dev team has little idea of what they want it to be. This being said if they tune it up nicely and figure out where the game is supposed to be going its grafically acceptable while being a terrible FPS. save your money for now and possibly forever.
0;the anti cheat is so bad that almost all server got aim hack and wall hack (see through walls)i played recently on HONGKONG HAPIS 1 and there are no admins online all the rad town is secured by walls just yesterday got raided by hackers he shot me before i even peeked through the window so......pls improve the anti cheat. the current one sucks
0;This game need 100000 Ram ... and with my good pc i have fps drops ... lags and more ... +1 year in early acces ... not bad game but this lags and fps frops bugs douing this game sometime unplayable... wait on release now i dont recommand you this game (and i play 700+ hours)
0;Honestly this game got worse by the years. Have had it since the beginning of New Rust after legacy. But this game is wierd it's clunky and Facepunch keeps adding stuff we don't need in this kind of game. They added a node minigame that was not liked by the community and now they added Tree minigames it's getting worse and worse. BUT it's not a bad game it just could get better.
0;This is the worst game I have ever played! I would rather have my balls ripped out while getting my eyes gorged. It doesn't matter anyway because by the time you finish playing this game your balls will have exploded (if you are a girl you will grow balls... then they will explode) and your eyes will have melted out of your face. And don't worry it doesn't hurt this game is so bad that your body turns so numb you can't feel a thing. UNINSTALLING!
0;Addictive in a bad way and has a community comparibly as bad as counter strike.I get it's a survival game.I get it's supposed to be hard.But what I don't get is how you can expect someone to be in ANY way when there are no incentives to being an abolsute .
0;Just dont buy this game there is a million way to spend your money to have fun rust isnt one of them.I cant play with my friends the game is too badly optimized for them (with 770gtx 8gb i5 3+).The fact that the game is in alpha stage since 2 years should tell you to run away from this game listen to your instinct and do it.
0;I actually generally think this game is in my top 5 least likes games thats not threw anger or salt it just seems like the developers just dont know what there doing. I do NOT recommend this game but if your up for a horrilbe experince be my guest but over my 3 000 hours most of my memorys are bad one. I dont like saying it but it is best to speak the truth.
0;i miss legacy i bought it when shortly after it came out. dont get me wrong i kinda like the new rust and all it has become but i really loved the basic concept of legacy. legacy offered a less competitive aspect which made it alot more fun for me and my friend to find new people and make new friendships. sadly those days are gone and the creators destroyed the rust i loved so i must give this game a bad review. i am sorry for this but i simply cannot recomend this game that claims to be rust.
0;Do not buy. Very incompetent team. I found the game to be pretty much a scam as there isn't much to do. Raiding has become nearly impossible and you can make a full reinforced base fairly quickly. Yet it is impossible to raid. Team keeps releasing bad updates and game has been out for a while and isn't optimized. Updates that do come out are bad and ruin raiding. Pretty much a non optimized form of COD now that you can't raid with tons of lag. Game is a scam. Do not buy.
0;verall very bad PVP either does not exist or you just can survive more than 5 minWithout a squad it's just not worth itPVE almost not existingWeapon mechanics bad Building mechanics actually  imagination is the limitUpdate 1 12 2018Can't join any server.Devs have no solutions.Just deal with it.ATTENTION DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
0;Very bad game and very bad community. I'm going to unninstall this game after I write this review. Then I will kill myself and burn my computer and haunt the annoying people who keep r*ping me in this game. They don't have a life when they have 9198935902867496757q785q709278670297602786429687q908760q79867398678937967827896789768957680929562 hours on this game and they hack or are just fucking pro players and maybe they should think of getting a job or a life.
0;This game is literally becoming trash! Ive just played 6 games with hackers all in a row.... ive been on for about 35 minutes. How the hell do expect to play a game when youre getting shot through walls from a guy driving shot gun in a car across the map?
0;This game is actually a complete pile of garbage. Too many hackers and the game is so choppy and laggy that it becomes virtually unplayable for the first two three minutes because everyone is from everywhere in the world and there is a massive desync issue that is still somehow in effect. This game needs to be sold to a company that will actually better it and not one that is just going to rake in the money without making any actual improvements. Bluehole is a terrible terrible company.
0;The game is getting worse by the day.Rubberband lagsBullets not registering properly (e.g getting shot even though you're behind a wall)Poor match making system (queue for team/duo get yourself and no one else)Extremely poor chances to get any decent costumes
0;It feels that with every update they make for this game it gets worse and worse. It would be nice if the F*ckhead devs would do something to optimize this trash. It's a good game with good potential but it keeps getting ruined with every update that comes out.
0;The game is unoptimized but fun. The reason why I can't recommend this game is because 50 players in every game cant speak english (mainly bad for squads/duos) and have 1500 ping giving them an unfair advantage. It isn't racism it's practicality. MAKE BETTER CHINESE SERVERS and put them all there so we don't have to lose to people who are essentially cheating/exploiting.
0;Do you like garbage game servers? Do you like trash graphics with computer melting gpu and cpu usage? Do you like glitches random deaths by freaked out vehicles and bad physics? Well then this is a game for you. This game is 'esport ready' after all.
0;This game is extremely poorly optimized and server desync causes very strange problems. For instance while firing backwards on the back of a bike I somehow murdered my driver. Cool feature.This game will be fantastic once it is optimized further. The sheer amount of money that players have thrown at it vs the state of the game is ridiculous.
0;Battle Royale is a great genre but if you're considering this don't.This game is still broken. I don't get when people saying the game is dead when there's still more than a player playing the game. But still not defending this trash. From what I see this should be a free game so it can compete with fortnite.
0;after spending a bit of time attempting to play this game my conclusion is region locking is needed badly hacking is a every game occurance and server stability or lack of it needs addressing promply . i love the idea of this game but cannot stand its flaws esports ready as claimed it is not get to work blue hole . you have less time than you think .
0;this game is so ing trash. i paid ing 30 pounds for this ing stupid game. the hit mechanics are so wank. the gunplay is you die in t ways i just dont liek this game no more. blueballs made so much money yet cant even optimise the game. the game runs like trash. stupid bugs stupid glitches 2/10. FORTNITE IS BETTER SO THIS TRASH REALSITIC GAY ASSS GAME. I CANT W8 FOR THE SAVAAGE MAP
0;Played this game for a few hours now. The movement controls are absolute garbage. You have to play on poor control settings Everything is glitchy indicators and sound bugs make it impossible to know where you are getting shot at Asains are at the gameAlso early access they proably won't improve this game.This game will be forgotten like h1z1
0;Absolutely awful game. They haven't even attempted to fix the lag desync and cheaters. You'll get shot after you are 5 feet behind cover ran over by flying cars and get pulled back to the ground when you jump because of lag. DO NOT waste your money on this trash. Wait for something better!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;this game goin to be die soon. it's already a year and they receive so much income from this game. but they never fix this trash server trash optimization slow development now they being so greedy by disabling trading and make more paid loot boxesfor they who want to buy this game better stay away if you wont waste your money. they losing player day by day
0;Utter garbage and the owner CEO or whatever Brendan Greene is a terrible person who panders to the majority Chinese user base lag is terrbile even with a powerful computer and good ping also map design is UTTER TRASH.Would not recomend even if it became a cheap game. (would be a good f2p though)DONT BUY!
0;badly optimized laggy bad hitboxes bad terrain character posing (can't lay on the ground on some rocks)...bad coding. it takes more than 3 shots from assault rifle to down a person (didn't expect that kind of sheet from ArmA dev) BUT u can be killed with 1 shot jump punch in the head. + u can farm pointsUpdate 03.10.2018Omg this is still sooo laggy and unoptimized. No fun in getting freeze at the end of the game and crash...Why am I still playing this....yep boxes of course...
0;Becoming unplayable. Honestly the guns are trash and uncontrollable. all i can use are dmrs or snipers cause the guns are just terrible. this was the only game i used to play daily and it just got ruined. Honestly the game is basically dead to me. i would recommend anyone who wants to play a battle royale theres a few new ones that are gonna come out soon but this game is just ruined. between hackers and terrrible just terrible gun mechanics.
0;This game is so bad the character's does not even respond to the mechanical keyboard when you for example strafe left there is a slight delay before your character starts moving this does not happen in the battle royale Ring of Elysium.The delay ruins the game 100% you should fix the delay before you even release such a .
0;This game is a total non sense. Assaulted NA servers by Asian and Chinese players bad ping bad hit detection non registering shots and hackers who know's exactly where your at...don't waste your money on this. On 10 games in a row I coudnt find a speakin english partner...what a joke
0;still glitchy still desync (altho a bit better still very bad) there are alot more cheater now and when you play vs chinese players they teleport around..... i have high hopes low expectations would not buy again untill fixed also when you are sitting behind a hill or in tall grass if a player is more then a couple hundred meters away they can see you even if you cant see them because of the poor distance rendering.
0;the ing lag is so bad it takes 5 min befor you can take 1 step and there is no chanse to pick up a gun. ( and no its not my connection its the ing servers) and its not because of loading at the beginning eather sometimes im fine at first than the lag comes but sometimes its after iv ben it the game for 10 15 min. fix your servers plz
0;This game has very very bad latency issues. Behind wall no problem just shoot the wall. Houses don't spawn.... ok developers ban you for their own faults. Game is unplayable in any servers you will get 250 million chinese hackers that pubg doesn't do anything about.
0;I want so badly to play this game but between the server lag and MASSIVE amounts of cheaters it is nearly impossible. If you are reading this review I dont want you to think that there is a tollerable amount of cheaters because that is NOT the case. There is indeed AN UNORTHADOX AMOUNT OF CHEATERS!!!!!!!!!
0;I deleted this game ages ago from my library I saw updates and was thinking I would give it another shot. but WOW the game is even worse then before 0 improvement on the hit reg 0 effort from this trash developer team. Oh we need to focus on putting out new maps guns and dumb things like grips. It is just falling even further down the trash can.
0;Developers are completely incompetent.You make a couple of $100 million and you still can't do the basics of a video game. These devs do not give a sh!t. The list of unbelievable backward decisions and terrible broken updates is endless by this point.The game has not been improved it is just being haphazardly patched together with chewing gum.It has reached the point now where I would rather play Fortnite. I don't like Fortnite.
