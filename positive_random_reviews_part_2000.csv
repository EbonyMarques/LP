1;The game is addictive and fun to play. Licensed characters and constant updates make it even better.The biggest downside is that it has become toxic because of school kids who are bullied at school and who take out their frustrations in the game. There are teams who deliberately demote their ranks to troll low rank killers (2 out of 3 games).
1;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME CAUSE THERE ARE SOME KILLERS WILL FOLLOW YOU NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IN WHICH YOU'LL GO LOOPING EACH OTHER Who said this game is a horror game but MEHHHH Lieesssss ahhahahaha xDDDI never laugh so hard cause of this game I LOVE IT &lt 3333
1;Really like the game prob. one of my favorites. )But instead of working on making new killers and survivers the game developers should maybe consider balancing the difficulty between playing as a surviver/killer since it is really hard to survive where it is much easier just playing as a killer.
1;It's a fun game that I really enjoy. It is not perfect but what game that is still in developement is completely perfect? It just needs some time.But the real problem to me is the players (not everybody tho).They're so horrible they insult each other and I mean survivors AND killers.If you lose get over it it's just a game.
1;so after 700+ hrs of playing this game i still love playing this game. it does have its flaws but after 2 years since it came out the devs still come out with new content survivors/killer plus always a new map to play in so hope they keep coming out with new stuff and i do recomend this game to anyone specially playing with a group of friends
1;Its a pretty awesome game. Its almost like Evolve except the survivors are the ones worrying instead of the killer because they cant fight back. But the game is still a bit buggy like with survivors dying on the hook the entity cant grab their souls or downed survivors cant be picked up by the killer. Still overall its definitely a fun game
1;Ignore all these negative reviews complaining about matchmaking and not having a party system yet the game has not even been out that long. New features and balances will come you just have to be patient. The game is still amazing regardless. Once you get the hang of it you're hooked. )
1;Been sitting here for 30minutes pressing ing ready in this press ready simulator with my friends. they should add a queing system for lobbys but that would take away from the immersiveness of you having to press the ready button 100 times before you actually find a game. 10/10 would press ready again
1;"""Okay..I kinda have mixed feelings about this. And it's not about the gameplay. It's about duo queue. It is way to bugged right now. I hope they fix that. Everytime you don't find a match you have to press """"READY"""" again. And sometimes your party goes to a seperate lobby and you have to invite them again.Other then that I absolutly love this game. I mostly play as survivor since I think it's better played that way.Final Verdict 9/10"""
1;Dear BHVRs On behalf on players on DBD (killer and survivor) here's my thought about the game https //youtu.be/jHjaHygfWHABut despite of all the bugs and glitches that happens I still love this game very much and always be in my heart.GG and WP devs &lt 3
1;Good game better if you play with friends for communication. The only problem is that me and my friends sometimes search a lobby for a long time before we can start a game and then we have a camper killer... But overall it's fun enough to make me recommend it )
1;This is sort of a mixed review. I love this game a lot it's fun with friends and overall I enjoy it. However my internet cut out while I was loading into the game and it reset all of my progress. I tried emailing and tweeting them about the issue and I got no response back.
1;hey guys stonedgoat here faaaaagggsss whats up im here wich a leeegiiiit revieeeww lets get into itfirtsm off i just wanna say whats up?ltell me how ur summers been hopefully u ed allot of spicsss and nogghersok game is trash if no frend so dont buy if ur lonely sav like me
1;We need more server for other country every single game I join is laggy and delay. I cant play. I just keep teleporting or the animation just keep repeat in my screen.But this is a good game. Just need more server and UI friendly and some optimzation for this game
1;I love this game so much but the fact im rank 20 playing killer and i go against ranks 6's and 5's? the matchmatching is awful there are plenty of trolls afks campers toxicity. I love the game and I do reccomend it but the game does need some changes.
1;I am a player of this game since patch 1.0.1. I've been through the ups and downs the game has had. I hate to see this game go down because the devs are not patching some of the bugs that the community has noticed. I really REALLY enjoy this game. And i will hate to see it go down
1;Altough the community is very Toxic with facecamping killers to teabagging survivors I keep coming back to Dead by Daylight to spend my time. With each progress you feel some accomplishment and never feel like your time being wasted. There is a good balance between killers and survivors (sometimes they fk up the balance with a new killer) but that's solved with a quick update most of the time!
1;very fun game I dont know why people diss it soo much for my first couple of hours the game was hard and confusing but once you get the hang of it youre golden stealthing around the killer when they are just feet away from you or nearly missing a skill check that could give you away. This game is better played coop with friends I would'nt reccomend solo
1;this game is fun if ur with a good friends however it mostly dies out at around 50hours playtime. i know people who've been playing it religiously but personally i find the game to slowly get boring as u get used to the atmosphere and you arent as scared as before. also there are quite a few balance issues matchmaking issues boosters ruining fun for others.id recommend it for a few days weeks of fun but better not buy unless theres a sale too many issues to make it worth at full price.
1;This game is really fun but playing with friends is horrible you need to press ready for like a 1000 times before you join a lobby and half of the time the killer leaves and you need to find a new lobby. but overall I do recommend this game After about 4 5 months the crappy match making has been fixed. but there are still a few problems with the game but the devs say they are working on it.
1;The game is pretty wierd!My friends told me it was great when they played the first time.But after 3 hours they said this Game is Very Boring!!!!You just Fix Machines and GTFO.I Think The reason is The Suvivors Has Been Too Suck!Now You can not Make Fun to The killer and laugh at him.You just Hide!!!But I just Like It I still Hope the Suvivors Rising
1;Dead by Daylight has always been my favourite game to play there's always constant updates on the game to improve the game. For example the revamp of the blood web to have have lesser nodes and the choice within 2 perks instead of one. Really helpful update! The idea for survivors to have infinite health when being hooked the first time to encourage killer not to camp you is also a really good idea. I love Dead by Daylight hahaha
1;Really a nice game. Original dark atmosphere fear and tension.Killer and Survivor can increase his powers just some matcihng problems (playing against characters with level more higher than you... really it's not easy) but you can see the current level of players in the lobby and you can leave for change it.Be a Killer is funny like to be the Survivor.
1;I do recommend this game but a little heads up. Its a huge grind fest. You will get trolled by killers and survivors And if you think getting a better rank will stop you from being tunneled and facecamped your wrong. lvls 15 to 10 is the more trolly killers they are on that brink where they still think rank matters and are super try hard. But all in all there is just too much fun in this game
1;Join lobby.I'm level 1.A guy next to me is level 20.He asks me to leave.I ignore him.He says he does not want to play with noob.I ignore him.Another level 20 joins.The first one keeps asking me to leave.I ignore him.10 minutes into the game.5 engines repaired.Only me and the first guy alive.I open the exitHe gets caught.He cries.He struggles.He wants to live.He looks at me....I ignore him.I escape.10/10 would sacrifice again.
1;This game is a great hide and seek game but has a few problems with no friend queues and somtimes its hard to get into a lobby when the game cannot find a match but i hope a lot of the problems can be fixed and could make an immersive survival horror game.p.s windows in the ironworks of misery+survivor killer getting mugged off a lot
1;The game currently is unplayable due to people leaving or dcing out of a session thus ruining the game for the killer. Who is the host and the only player that matters for making it fun for others. Its a mess but extremely fun at the beginning of the game when you just start out.EDIT I changed my review since the update. Now killers and survivors are balanced and you are no longer punished if people leave the match.
1;Great game thrilling and you get to scare the crap out of survivors when you play as the killer. What's not to like? Oh right the rank obessed players who would disconnect the moment they get hanged so they could preserve their pips (or whatever). If some kind of penalty was implemented towards curbing such force disconnects that would be great. Pretty much the only gripe I have about this otherwise entertaining game with decent potential. 5/7
1;"""""""I hope you die ing """"""""I hope your familiy dies of cancer and aids"""""""" ing kill yourself""""Those are all the words of this game's nice players and also the only downside I can see to this game. If the community weren't as toxic as it is then this game would be so much better.Also not a single hacker I have reported so far has been banned yet wtf get your together."""
1;Titles DBD has claimed.Awarded number 1 game for reinacting lobby simulator 2017 18Awarded best game for balance 2016Awarded best dev interaction 2016Awarded Top 10 'Best ranking system' 2018Awarded cleverist bans given to playersOnly a fraction of awards that DBD has acheived. Here's hoping they obtain more!
1;I say we need a killer perk named 'Camper magnet' that can attract all survivors to the killer after one survivor has been hooked and the killer camps him. That way all killers can be finally happy and they can finally have 4+ kills per match. Then all the mean and petty survivors can suck it and learn to git gud nub.That being said the game is fun but some players are toxic as hell.
1;This game is a fun horror survival game. It is currently under a rough time with the glitches and bugs that it is experiencing. If you can look past that though it is a fun game and does have redeeming qualities enough so that I would recommend it to other people.
1;I'm a huge Horror movie fan and just recently bought the game. This game definitely gets your blood pumping and does not disappoint! You definitely need to get your reaction time down for the QTE's to help get the generators up and running. Did you have a hard day at work??? No worries! Just log in as a Killer and take it out on some survivors. Stress Therapy...Check! But seriously it is a very fun game!
1;This game is definetly a fun one to play with but could still use a bit of improvement. There is quite a bit of lag and the match ups can be really bad when new players get paired up against/with level 20+ players. If some of these things are fixed as well as a few other bugs this game has huge potential. Plus who doesn't like hunting and killing their friends?
1;I highly recommend playing this game to any sci fi thriller or horror game/movie addict. AFAIK it's the best Co Op horror game on Steam and it's worth every penny. It's still in it's early phases of development and considering that it's freakin' amazing. THUMBS UP!
1;So far the game itself has been good and the leveling system is pretty good. The only con I have is the lobby system as sometimes it can take 5 10minutes trying to start a game. This is due to Survivors trying to play with friends which is fair enough but it does need a decent lobby system. Overall still worth $20
1;Firstly This Game Should Be Called Dead By Loading! Because By The Time You Get A Game You Age 30 Years!Secondly They Should Have Dedicated Servers Would Get Rid Of Most The Problems!Also When You Are In A Friends Lobby You Keep Getting Cannot Start With 0 Killers Well Obviously Not As We Are A Lobby Of Surviviours!Apart From Them Few Teething Problems Its Really Is A Good Game When You Finally Get One That Is!Sort It Out Please!!!!
1;At first I found this game to be really repetitive and thought I was going to regret my purchase. After a while however I realized that this game kept getting me to come back to it as the matches are addicting. There are several different killers and maps making each scenario slightly different. Depending on the skill of the other players the game can be very challenging or easy. Anyways it s a lot of fun!
1;Dead by daylight is a 4v1 online game with competitive mode Ok guys this is probably my favorite game I ever played l came here because when l play outlast l was thinking how can be outlast online thats basically this game Very fun with friends and withouth A lot of killers and survivors... there is Bill from L4D29/10 bcause has a toxic community and a not a lot but there are bugs
1;Great game Really fun to play by yourself or with friends. There are some awesome moments when you sucsessfuly juke the killer or he walks right past you without seeing you as well as the satifing feeling as killing everyone or maybe I'm just a psycopath.
1;I have played this game for a long time and felt it was time a made a review. Acording to the fact I say i have played it for a long time that probably shows that I have a positive review this game is great. I love how they are always trying to even out the killer and the survivors ability. They are always making it better and better and adding new content.Great. Game.
1;The game is buggy and there are obvious problems however I can excuse that for now because it is fairly new. The devs seem to be interested in improving the game in a timely manner. The game it self is fun. Personally I find more enteretainment in being a killer and hunting down the survivors. However the flip side is also good times especially if you have a group of friends to play with. I give DbD a 7 out of 10.
1;1)Select play as a killer2)Wait 30 mins to find a match with 4 survivors full of legacy and flashlights3)Get 4/4 kills4)All the survivors start spamming your profile with rep camper noob tuneler don't respect 360's5)EnjoyEven if this game is actually trash i love it.Pretty good job so far.
1;"""Even after almost 200 hours of playing and getting """"good"""" at this game you'll still get mori'd three times in a row and depip because killers are s.If you're looking for a competetive game it's not this one. If you're looking for a fun experience with friends look no further.I rate this game a 3 my current record for being mori'd in a row."""
1;after 600 hours i have to say this is a pretty solid minecraft out of five nights at freddy'sits got its bugs but its still really fun. best played with friendspro super fun with friendsevery match is differentmany oc but also killers like michael myers or freddy kruegercon has some bugs
1;Dead by daylight is an interesting game with a unique playstyle. I have invested a couple of hours into this game so far and have enjoyed my experience both as a survivor and as a killer. However that said If you are looking to play this game with your friends then expect to be waiting awhile whilst the solo match making queue seems to work flawlessly queuing with friends does not and can really ruin the experience if you want to play with friends.
1;OK so I've had this game for awhile but was so obsessed with chasing down survivors I forgot to leave a review. Sorry guys. Well I love this game and feel the devs are insanely ontop of the patchs and do a damn good job of balancing and adding new content like the upcoming Halloween Chapter(Chapters new killer new survivor new map XD). Honestly the game is ridiculously cheap for how fun the game is.Hope to hang u around soon.
1;Recently got back into this game after hearing about the leveling system wich is great and that people just starts bombing this game with negative reviews is just showing people thinking about buying this game how toxic people can get when they're giving the right to free speech.i mean the game have had its up's and down's but is getting better gameplay wise but the community is just going to hell.
1;I highly recommend this game for those who want to play a third party game with friends and want to have fun by running from the killer and repairing generators.That tension when you're the last and you only have one door open and the killer is camping it it's amazing.It's worth the money only on sale though
1;I really enjoy this game. I do wish they would add different maps instead of adding different things in the map. I expected more maps for the game before beta but it was the same map just with some extra new features in it. The game is solid. It gets your blood pumping and you actually feel that rush while playing the game. If you're into horror games or movies this game is for you. But again MORE MAPS! D
1;I love this game theres just a couple problems that I would like for the devs to do.Main thing is Bugs. The Devs just keep making DLC and with the recent adition of Leatherface I was a bit cause there doing nothing about the bugs. The opitimazion in this game is horrendus and even with the best PC's they still cant run this game perfectly. If they fix these problems the game would be perfect.(Now I have had a lot more time with the game these reasons are still accurate.
1;If you look past the perks system giving long time players advantages when they're matched up against/with new players (which sadly happens a bit too frequently) and the fact that occasionally it takes quite a while to find a match Dead by Daylight is an amazing game. The gameplay (save aforementioned perks system) is very balanced all the killers are fun to play and there's definitely a lot of skill and teamwork required. Definitely a recommend.
1;It is a really fun game. I have accumualted alot of hours on this game. I have almost 1 character to lvl 50 now and almost none of my survivors are below lvl 10. So I can say that this game is really fun. Has alot of replay value. Just I hate campers and I wish there was something to prevent camping like that.
1;This game is fantastic and definately worth it's price. Espcially since it'll be on sale til July 4th. This being said the only complaint I have about this game is that if you bought the Deluxe Edition you don't get the sound track like it says you will. #Wraithisn'top
1;Satisfying to play killer if you are smart. I love to play killer (rank 1) by the way. I really like to smack those tains with my big sharp weapon who are touching my precious gennies. They will die slow as I hang them like dry jerky letting the blood drip while the Entity will slowly but surely swallow their souls and purge their bodies into the depths of hell. Overall I like smacking them. D
1;Hello there!I really like playing it! DBD is much fun and its best playing with friends. Im getting super annoyed by all the bugs and unbalanced Killer Survior Perks (My opinion). If u wanna have all DLC's it costs a lot of money but they aren necessary so thats fine with me.
1;Fun but the matchmaking is bad. prestiged players shouldnt be with noob killlers. Freddy and The Doctor are hard to play against at my level. Im great at skill checks and sneaking but juking and bullying not so muchThe huntress shoudnt have her movement speed slower thatn the base killer speed.I love the knowledge that somebody is gonna die next time their hooked.
1;I recommend it highly. The developers are working on this game all the time trying to make it fair for killers and survivors. It is really fun D Things change all the time to keep the game fresh. New characters often. Keep up the good work devs. The people that whine are just pansies to be honest.
1;you got them there killerwhatnots swinging their sharp doodads on the other hand you play as one of those survivin bois running around shoving your hand in moving parts that somehow makes a generator run. all in all i rate this game 3 spicy bacon cheese bois and one sharp man high five.
1;Dead By Daylight can be extremely fun and challenging. The idea of the game is a good idea and hopefully the devs can improve the game further.I recommend this game because it can at times become addicting to play. If you ignore the stupid glitches and bugs it is really enjoyable. However with friends it's a even more enjoyable. )
1;I've officially logged 100 hours into this game and I can't get enough of it. Usually I hate horror games but this one is so interesting and exciting that I'm always looking for new techniques to outsmart the other player(s). Would definitely recommend this game to all of my friends.
1;Played this game in beta which i feel was a great decision for the developers. Thought it was a terrific game the suspense is the best and the first time you hear that heartbeat getting closer is enough to drop you dead. Beta got me hooked and definately a highly reccomendable game.Edited for grammar still an awesome game.Edit again Thanksgiving 2018 Still a great game the updates i feel balanced the game a bit out but the community is filled with s so rip.
1;Had to brake the game...it's still fun if you start playing now and don't know abput the old versions (or as i call them the real Dead by daylight)new killer is a doctor and it's hard to win against himso you need to learn how to play on YT fixes happen i'm the best minor things bother but i'm sure other stuff will distract and be even worse in the next update
1;I like to play Wraith when I'm depressed. If I'm ringing my bell repeatedly and just hitting random objects feel free to farm boldness points off me or what not. I'm sure we can all use a breather and if virtual currency will make you happy that's good for me.Please practice teamwork survivors.Please avoid hook camping killers.Wraith and Claudette are my babies and I will cherish them forever.You have a wonderful day if you're reading this.
1;Product received for free. Well if you already know what this game is about and you are here to ask if it's worth it then YES it's 100% worth it if this is the type of game that you would like. It is quite populated it is great fun.If you don't know what kind of game is this imagine a monster game like a bloody version of Skooby Doo or a Redneck version of the Alien movie.For this price it is absolutely worth it and it has enough fun for hundreds of hours in here.
1;The game is super fun and I personally find it addicting. Some games you get chill killers that let you relax for a bit but some games the killer is right on you so there is a lot of change of pace between games. Just saying though the game is 20 times more fun with friends!
1;its fun when you know how to play and ur not facing a killer who is a and face camps or a killer who is an absolute god at killer.As survivor it takes time killer ez but suvivor is ok Killer ez put some time im not that good anymore but was rank 8 kiiller and higher but was fun as killer just need to find the right one.
1;one of the best game i have played everi laugh when i see negative review givebad comment but play dbd 20++ hours.well u know this game is just release so little bug it's not a problem.pros stress release. nice soundtrack sfx. unique gameplay. many map char. instant heart attack. good skill system. psychopath mickey mouse tutorial. sex dungeon.cons no party rankmatch(dev announce party rankmatch system will be implement soon n keybind). no hard pinalty. rare bug. f**king heart attack.
1;Not quite as terrifying as being subjected to russian experiments but is tons of fun to play with my friends Steve Natasha and Sam. Not the best in terms of balance but definitely a fun way to relax after a tough day at work. Frequent updates keep the game fun for a long time I would know about things that have been around forever. Can be frustrating at times and the other players can be hit or miss. Definitely worth picking up.
1;It's a fun game i play a ton of it but as a killer it sucks.I just started out trying to play killer and im a level 2 keep getting matched with level 50 rank 1 surviors .... this needs to be fixed its not fun when you vs high level players as a low level killer. It's impossible to win.
1;I absolutely love this game!!!! From dying on the hooks to hunting your prey down and hanging them up to dry Dead by Daylight has a great atmosphere thaat has intense moments that make your blood rush!!! Worth every penny I paid even the DLC's are nice even though you have to pay extra you do not need them to play and enjoy this wonderful experience.
1;Game Is Fun And Addicting But The Fact Of The Matter Is That Survival Is Op And Needs To Be Nerfed All You Have To Do Is Go Back And Forth Over A Cover And The Killer Cant Catch You And After Like 167 Times He Will Just Leave So Enjoy The Fact That This Games Needs Some Fixing For Sure Other Then That Great Game
1;"""This game is really fun though it's almost impossible to play a killer match without getting called a tunneler and getting comment's on your profile like """"such a tunneler kys"""" without u even tunneling anyone. I guess it is that way because loads of people in this community are pretty toxic from time to time. """"No sh*t FP"""" But really why do I care I'm a suvivor main )"""
1;This is a very fun game that offers two completely different dynamics to place with killer/survivor. It can be very fun to play with friends. There are some development issues just like any game. The community can be very cool and positive but there is a very toxic side to this community. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone especially if you appreciate horror type games.
1;A Fun game that can be played competitively or for $hits and giggles.Sometimes you are hyperactive dodging hits hitting your pallets and skillchecks and the next day when you run into the killer around the corner you might jump out of your seat.Can recommend especially if in sale for $10!
1;When I first started playing this game it was like most said...frustrating at most times. The changes that I've seen being made over the time I've played have been very good. The reponse from the devs and their streams every week show that they really care about the players. The player base however is full of salt. Both on Killer and Survival side. Only con I have is the DLC for the Clown is kinda meh I think they could have gone with better dynamics. The killer model is great looking though.
1;Great game has potential to become even bigger. The only things that should be fixed in future is the searchsystem for games with a friend clicking every 10 sec ready is really annoying I mean just let him search for a game until it finds one even if it takes several minutes. And of course own servers would be awesome lettig people host on the local maschine is not that good.All in all a really great game i deffinitly recommend it.
1;"""Very good game if you are interested in """"horror"""" survival games this is for you. Matchmaking sometimes sucks but it is pleasure to play some games and have fun. I am playing this game also on Xbox so I couldn t forget to buy it on PC )I recommend this game. BOi"""
1;This game is so fun I love it I definitely reccomened it if you like a challenge if you dont mind waiting a bit to get into a game of course that is my only problem is playing with friends because its so difficult to get in a game with them besides kill your friends. But overal I give it a 9.5 out of 10 because I just love this game to death.
1;most fun game i've played so far now that they have fixed survive with friends the game is one of the best games to play with friends and by yourself if your deciding to get this game or not i would highly recommend it only one thing the devs need to look at. the balance of perks on both killer and survivor some are a must have and some are a throw away other than that my favourite game
1;Product received for free. Searching for a match &gt No matches foundSearching for a match &gt No matches foundSearching for a match &gt No matches foundSearching for a match &gt Finds a lobbyIT WAS JUST A PRANK BRO! Back to seaching.its worth waiting tho ) Good game
1;"""As a killer you have so much fun. You get the chainsaw (wow!) and you also get a beautiful bell which I might add scares the crap out of my guy friends who are meant to be """"brave"""". As a survivor the game's atmosphere is absolutely fabulous! I haven't played such a thrill game in such a long time that actually gets my heart racing let alone actually making me jump. I would also recommend this game to everybody who loves a thriller and just wants to release some tention as a killer )"""
1;"""Dead by Daylight is probably the only horror game that works with coop. Although there has been games made previously that are similar to dead by daylight but lack the horror/action effect that dead by daylight has to offer. However the game is loaded with bugs and deteriorates the """"scary"""" effect but the experience still overwhelmingly worth to buy. Or maybe i'm only writing this review because i'm addicted. 6/10 Graphics9/10 Gameplay10/10 Bugs10/10 Glitches10/10 Exploits10/10 Infinites"""
1;One of my favorite games. I started out as a killer (because being a survivor was too scary) but now I've evolved into a survivor as well. Don't take the negative reviews too seriously most of them are from extremely competitive players who are constantly upset over minor rebalances in the recent patch.
1;"""This game is actually pretty good. I like it quite a lot (not including the games I get camped) 700+ hours and I can play and enjoy it like if I just bought it. 8/10. Would recommend.Below is my favorite quote from one of the devs.""""I think we've done a pretty good job so far"""" Mathieu Cote"""
1;This game is very fun. Had tonnes of fun during the Free Weekend so I decided to buy. However it comes with a few bugs and some uneven matchmaking which may dissuade new comers. But fret not as the developers are very active in pushing out updates and new content which is why it is definitely worth to buy )
1;Hag is broken. She sets traps at the base of hooks and because the clones have collision it's impossible to unhook. Same goes for trapdoor. Also she does not need that many traps. Please limit to 6 or put a 2 minute timer on the 10 traps she currently has and PLEASE get rid of the collision. (Also fix the stun for decisive/wiggling off. It's bull.) Thnx.
1;Two of us left I am injured Using the bond perk notice that the other teammate is hiding in a closet by the hatch Teammate is waiting for me to die so he can escape Spam the enter closet button hoping killer sees Killer knocks me out Killer opens closet and takes guy out Killer hangs guy on hook Guy dies I start spinning in circles on the floor Killer picks me up Killer carries me to hatch I escape10/10 would rat out campers again
1;Where to i being its a very fun game to be honest BUT SERIOUSLY WALL JUMPERS ARE MOSTLY LEVEL 15 AND BELOW I RECOMMED YOU if you playing as a monster just create another lobby dont waste your time on those guys i was playing a match this player he was lvl 9 and he was wall jumping bad and then when he was about to go down in the last hit HE FROZE MY GAME AND HE ESCAPED We need to stop this or the game will die very fast
1;10/10Got chased by a invisible dude who would ring a bell everytime he saw me... Then I steeped on a beartrap got rescued and healed myself by puting a bandage on my arm... After that a random guy chased me with a kitchen knife... And to finish it all i got hanged on a hook.Would play again
1;It's a really good game. Its annoying as you start off because it takes SOOO much practise to git gud at this but after that you cant stop playing. I loved the hide and seek part of the game and even the chases were so much fun. It did get annoying with face camping killers but as I said git gud and you wont have to deal with them (
1;This Game is amazing! The Graphics used in this game is amazing! The only down side of the game is that it is every buggy. The game lags with different servers when playing. But other than that Friends are enjoying it too when playing with them! I cant't wait to see what new updates bring to the game! Me personally only playing 15 hours. I have enjoyed every single minute of the game. I Hightly recommend to new players.
1;I've been playing this game sense it first came out (didnt get a chance to try the beta) and i have loved it. While i am not that good (lets just blame that on the lack of actual time to play) its still a very fun experience..... even when something happens that ticks me off to no end. but thats just how any multiplayer game can go right?
1;Good asymmetrical survival horror game that provides tensity while maintaining a sense of purpose for survivors. It suffers from a hefty dose of grind fatigue however as it takes hundreds of hours to create a good perk build for both survivors and killers.As a whole i would rate the game a 7/10 as of now.
1;I think this is a great game and in the future it can be even greater but a few things that need improvements are the killers not being able to watch the people hang there until they die mainly because its unmoral and just plain not fair secondly I feel as if the game needs more optimizations so the player can enjoy better gameplay. Overall I think this is a great game and I cant wait for it to unleash more killers and maybe even new surivors.
1;Love this game. It has some issues still such as matchmaking but it's getting worked on. Joined a game with a friend.We ran into Hillbilly he hit me with the chainsaw. Then he didnt move and did nothing.Friend Revived/healed me.Probably killer was AFK.Repaired every generator.Then we farmed points at the AFK killer.Suddenly he was alive hit me and my friend made me escape. And hanged my friend.30/20 would farm again P
1;I am fixing a generator while injured I see the wraith coming toward me I hide behind some trees The wraith goes invisible The wraith finds me I begin to run The wraith downs me while it is still invisible I get sacrificed I derank10/10 would get rekt by glitch again
1;Game keeps crashing when for example when i play the hillbilly as soon as i start running my chainsaw it crashes and as a survivor as soon as i try hitting a skill check it crashes. I really like the game but i really dont want to play when i cant even do anything.
1;I love this game and I enjoy so much playing it with my friends.However.Too many bugs crashes and bad players. Some game mechanics are destroyed by perks or offerings reducing fun factor.Matchmaking is another issue. First you will be matched with player of all kind strong e weak. Second many games will not start.
1;i have a lot of fun in this game. the only issue i have with this is the community. console players are toxic. There is not a proper tutorial for the game. in the beginning stages in order to rank up you have to survive for yourself and only yourself because rank 20 players either have the intelligence of a rock or they completely understand the game and will help you without alerting the killer.
1;Well this game is so popular most of you might be seeing this game on youtube and found it fun it is fun but you will find the game so hard at you first 10 20 hours but its just so fun when you get someone in a hook or escape the killer or survive at the end of the game you need a decent PC to run this game idk why but i have lag only when im playing killer.
1;Very good game with great mechanics. I only wish the devs made a bonus if the killer leaves because I hate when you open the exit gates but the killer leaves so you don't get rewarded for escaping. Other than that very balanced and a good 12 PM spook.
1;This game is absolutely amazing to play however it does have one incredibly big problem. If you play with one friend you will almost never get into a game. The que's are incredibly bad for playing with friends which is unfortunate because the game itself is great. When I play with a friend the average wait time finding a match is about 15 minutes which is absolutely rediculous. Please developers fix your que's so we can enjoy your game with our friends!!!!!!
1;Dead by Daylight is an honestly great idea and a game it emphaisizes teamwork and the thing about matchmaking is that the surivors are woefully overpowered in later levels hence why no one plays killer and usually camps as killer. But that's besides the point I personally love playing killer against randos it's quite fun being called a camper when all i do is rotate. 10/10 would hook again.
1;I love this game I have played it for almost 200 hours now and still get great fun out of each and every game. However if I were to change one thing about the game it would be to add more things to do in the game. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game
1;i really enjoy this game really i do. but i do not like how the trapper and the new alien type thing can place traps directly under the person they have on the hook i feel this makes the game extremely unfair there should be a distance requirement for the traps.
1;its good fun however to have the best chance of surviving you need the top tier perks which you need to gring for. you can get by without them on new killers but the odd god will make you play yourself. If you want to play a killer you can mostly wing it the perks aren't too inportant on that side but a decent runner might make you a bit salty.best with friends(but fun solo too)not too buggy( anymore could change)
1;Really fun with friends and solo as well.Bugs need fixes though8/10Give it a try if you like being chased and chasing people. Requires high level thinking end game and survivors are really tricky to catch when they juke really well. 288 hours is pretty good of a indication that it's really fun.
1;&gt Join a game&gt no Matches found&gt join a game&gt wait for 10 seconds on load screen&gt back onto main screen&gt Repeat.Now don't get me wrong I have a blast when I actually get into a game and I'd recommend it. But only as a game to play with mates alone. It's a fun ride a little roleplay adds to this tension in this game. Great scares and playing the killer is a joy!Fix dat matchmaking system though.
1;I love this game so much fauvorite game hands down. but every other week i come up against some sort of problem like daily i get the heartbeat problem. when i launch i also get 2 games and have to go to task manager and take off one of them. sometimes my anticheat is messed up. i feel they need to fix the problems but i really like the game
1;PROS High skill ceiling Intense Not repetitive Altruism and fair play are summonedCONS Matchmaking is currenty unstable. Ranking system is stupid. If the killer disconnects you lose points. 80% of the matches are laggy and you rubberband.I don't know why but i keep playing it.
1;This game is far by one of the most fun multiplayer horror that I have played. It's replay value is very high as well as the shear terror you get everytime the killer approaches you. It's replay value is very high and it's just all laughs while playing with friends. Defintely recommend this game.
1;What I hate about the game is that when we get in the game are prestige are on the line which if the kill leaves the game we lose a survivor ranking which makes me mad I hope you get this message and fix it and yes I recommend this game this game is amazing just has some bugs because it is not fully done yet
1;I really like this game but the way you have to wait for an eternity before you actually get into a game only to find that other players were disconnected (not voluntarily).... You guys really need to fix the matchmaking queue it just takes too much time man.
1;Surprisingly I'm still having fun with this game after 120 hours of playtime great to play with friends and both roles survivor and killer are quite enjoyable. Devs seem to be constantly seeking balance improvements to the game as well fixing killers and perks that seem overpowered or hard to play against.
1;"""What an awesome game!! I was lucky enough to try it for free. I was so impressed by the game that I bought it immediately afterwards! Being a fan of the horror genre I love being able to stalk and kill """"helpless"""" victims. Don't even get me started about hanging them up on hooks. It appears that there is no shortage of DLC content too so the game should stay fresh for a while!"""
1;Dead by daylight will make your heart beat and you will feel the tension when sneaking around or getting chased by a raving psycopath! A must have for everyone who like horror! Plus you can play it with your friends. You can get hooked together and get camped but that's just another story...
1;I've owned this game for some time now. It's a lot of fun. The devs have done a lot of work to try and balance the game between the killer and the survivors not making it too easy or too hard for either side. Sometimes they fall short but the community quickly lets them know when something needs to be changed and 9/10 times they listen. I can't say that this game gives me scares like it used to but almost every game is exhilerating and exciting. Rating 8.5/10
1;Can you imagine as awsome as it would be if we could see other player's expressions on the coner of the screen while playing as the killer!? The look one one's face as you chase down one player and the closer you get the more intense things get. Although it could probably serve as a distraction... I give this game a 9 out 10! Excellent game with big potential for more.
1;"""Great game for under $20.00 but there are still a few bugs.Main issue is that there is no option to play with mixed parties.Unless you have 5 people playing in a custom game there's no way to party up with just 1 or 2 friends and search for a game.Your only option is to do a """"Quick Play"""" at the same time as your friend and hope to get in the same game.Adding a game Lobby before searching for a game would easily fix this."""
1;An amazing game. Especially when everyone is all in. The best is when you're paired up with a truly terrifying killer. Most of the time there is little to no lag. But occasionally there are issues. It is also friendly to a wide range of computers. I can run it on a relatively slow computer and I have friends who can run it on even slower systems.
1;i do not see the big problem with this game seeing the negative reviews i exspected it to suck it did not. it was fun to play and not your usual game load times are an issue and it does glitch in loading sometimes other than that it requires a decent pc or low settings fun game hope the devs are working on it
1;This game is Soooooooo goooood. i played 11 hrs on this game already and not bored of it. Im so glad i got this game. The only thing i dont like is the fact that the killer usally camps people on hooks and waits and then we die. This game is perfect and needs to come out with more characters more customizables and MORE MAPSSSSSSSSSSS. Good job on the game
1;Great game especially now since you can Match up with friends. The game still has a few bugs to work out but the DEV are excellent at responding to the community. They listen to the users and continue to update the game to make it more polished. Highly recommend!
1;Its a really good game the only thing i can think of is a vs ai mode so people dont let their team down if they are new or so new killers can give the survivers a real challenge because if the survivor or killer dosen't know what they are doing you might not get enough points to keep your hard earned rank.
1;This game is just awesome very unique and thrilling. It is as good as you can imagine. Many people are toxic of course but people just tend to be toxic. If you look carefully at those negative reviews you will see they all spent 1000+ hours on this game. So before you start thinking that this game is bad you will have a thousand hours of happy gameplay D
1;Dead by Daylight is a game in which you escape a savage killer by repairing generators. Or you play as the killer yourself and capture people and put them on hooks. The game is pretty solid it just needs a little polishing. The play with friends is a little buggy but other than that this game is amazing
1;This game is for those who wants extra challenge. This is not a battle royale nor killing zombies. You will never understand this game until you learn how to accept every rules and controls. Some killers have no mercy but it depends on the four survivors on how they can survive until the end. Teamwork attentiveness and stealth mode are important here.
1;Product received for free. Amazing game that has been on my wishlist for a very long time. Now that I have it I have to say I love the game. I'm definitely gonna need to practice skill checks more to compensates for my frame rates when they appear. I reccomend this game to all my friends. Its great to play with and without friends with plenty of DLC to keep the game interesting.
1;"""What do you want to feel Adrenalin? Fustration? Happiness? Fear? Despair? Indifference?Play this game and you can feel sometimes a lot feels but if you are sensitive with/about """"bugs"""" don't play that. If you are sensitive with people you can go away from this game game got a active community but s are inside.I can give a 7/10 on my 500 hour of play."""
1;OMFG the killer is so OP. FML. No .. that's kinda the point.I guess but the game crashes all the frikin time! Not for me but I'm not running a potato.Well people just don't play fair. Welcome to life.I hate you. Just ready up and stop crying about a game no one is forcing you to play.
1;WHen i played this game i get many scare moment. For eggsample i walk to fix generalator and it go boom i go fix again and i hear fast heart turn around there a woman with knife try to kill me so I run fast I run everywhere but she alway find me like teleport scotty. So she finally get me and i on ground crawl to bushmans but she still see me. I didnt sleep in like almost entire night but ok. Anyway I like game and would recomend to everyone who brave !!
1;Don't just look at the box Open it look past the frustrations and allow yourself to meet some amazing people then you'll truely know the entertainment this game can bring to you. Chase or be chased.There are many levels to this game can you see them for what they are?
1;Very exciting game. I recommend playing with friends mostly. For the most part the community is very nice and helpful. As with most games like this there may be one or two bad eggs. PThe Developers did a good job with just about every aspect of this game. Going forward a few general fixes to servers are needed and a couple glitches need tending to. Getting into a game is difficult sometimes but with a little patience it is worth it.
1;Very fun game however the matches arent dedicated so you can end up in really laggy games because the killer is always host. Also matchmaking isn't always great because they prioritize filling games quickly ove matching skill level. The game is still a little buggy but I have seen consistent improvement in all of these areas as the game as been updated.
1;This game is one of the most intense game i played in a long time. Right now i have about 65 hour and i still play it. I prefer having some steam friends for this game because playing alone isnt that much fun. I prefer this game because of the intense moments by getting chashed and the scary killers. There are some stupis parts about this game like camping killers and killers who always chase the same guy. 8/10 (sorry for bad english ) )
1;I love Dead by Daylight.This game has its bugs here and there but the dev team I see a dedication close to that of Warframe's team. A group that love their game and are constantly working on it. They listen to their audience and use hard numbers to try and balance things just right.The power trip of beating people to death and the feeling of escaping unscathed on either side of the fence are just great experiences. For such a cheap price it provides a lot of fun.
1;Product received for free. I really enjoy this game really fun and good survivors/killersMaps 8/10Survivors 7/10Perks 9/10Killers 8/10Clothing 6/10For those people who like surviving games this is the game for you.Christmas Update Review New Christmas theme for main menu Wraiths bell has been Changed betterChristmas lights have been added on lockers hooks and barrels.And etcI think we did a pretty good job so far 9/10
1;"""Great Game Lobby with Friends. Play 'who can click ready first' Have great bants whilst it pretends to search for lobby Play 'first to say """"this isn't gonna work""""' Spend hours doing nothingUnfortunately sometimes it takes you into an actual game and you're forced to have fun in a really good and exciting game. Sometimes you may get lucky and the killer will quit just as you get in.10/10 Would ready up again."""
1;Im still a bit new but i have over 150 hours on this game now. I can officially say this is the most amount of t in a game that i have ever played but its very fun. Somehow a hatchet will hit you from across the map you rage quit and then the next you just come back and play again. This game is great but very very infuriating.
1;Is this game perfect? Of course not. Is this game a ton of fun? Absolutely. A large variety of killers survivors and perks to mix and match make this game replayable for hours and hours. After 6 hours it becomes less spooky and more about the mechanics. There are still moments that will scare the out of you but playing with friends and hearing them scream as Michael Myers rounds a corner is priceless.
1;Product received for free. This game has gotten a lot of flak because of its bugs questionable game design choices and generally toxic playerbase but if you're willing to look past some of these this game is really fun and is absolutely at least deserving of a try.
1;Not very deep small in scale and something's always breaking but DBD is a quick and fun horror themed I kinda want to say MOBA that gives two different experiences. Playing survivor is great for an adrenaline boost and grinding out points playing killer is great for ruining a survivor's day. 7.5/10
1;Most people who are crying over the recent killer buffs have only played the game in the last year or don't even play killer at all. These were all needed changes and the game is more accessible to new players and more fun for veteran players then ever before.
1;Fix the killers reach so t how he is far behind me and still can attack me and grab me when im jumping over obstacles or hit me when i turn on a tree and the skill check is not sync correctly. And please fix it so we can have reliable server cause im tired of dieing when the host have bad connection especially when i run into a rock. other wish its a good game. and when the killer camps it makes the game quite boring.
1;7.5/10Pros good fun with friends simpleCons heaps of bugs and issyes such as disconnects glitches getting frozen crashes heaps ranking system is forever worse than beta you need 5 people to start match making is awful repititive camper killers much much moreDespite all these many many issues its still a fun game. It does get a little annoying often though
1;This game is very good Mechanic Graphic overall is good. But one thing that i didn't like is the DLC killer is too OP. And killer have skill that make survivor hard to repair and it is toooo OP. i hope dev can nerf the DLC killer and add new map constantly. anyway this game is worth to buy if u have friend play this game too. i give 8.5/10
1;Just here to help against the review bombing games always have their downs and ups when it comes to balancing. This patch will bring in a new playstyle or will eventually be reverted if it really is that bad as some people think.The community is toxic btw so be careful with that but which online community isn't toxic at this point?
1;A good game that will definitely keep you entertained. If you don t mind waiting forever to get into a game getting dropped a few times in the process. Please don t get me wrong the game has a lot going for it but it has now been out for a while I would have hoped that long lobby waits glitchy gameplay and highly over powered killers would have been addressed and fixed by now
1;This Game is absolutely fantastic. It only has a couple mechanical bugs like when trying to get into or loading a game it wont load and you cant close the window. The game itself is great. It is thrilling and strategically challenging as a survivor and thrilling to hunt down survivors as the killer. The game has a big skill sealing so the game has long term playable value. Like I said the only BIG bugs were the loading which are frustrating at worst.
1;The game is only fun if you are playing with friends or you're the killer. Other than that it doesn't have much going for it. The Halloween update was a step in the right direction adding a classic killer. It is a good time waster till Fridat the 13th comes out.... Or so I thought. This game is the absolute baller when you are with a group of good friends. Must have for any horror and survival fans!
1;I got this game during Steam Summer sale and recently started playing as Fortnite is Doo Doo now. I can't believe I didn't try this game sooner I watched many friends on twitch play way back in October. Now I've been streaming it 8 hours a day grinding BP.I have close to 65 hours in 1.5 weeks I think that alone speaks for itself how good this game is! If you want to know more drop by my stream and I can show you how fun DBD can be!
1;Most of my friends have played around the 30 hours mark and they enjoyed themselves that was earlier days too when the bugs were a lot worse. I'd say this game is worth a try as it's a unique (or was until Friday the 13th) experience. Bugs aside. I'm going by what I've seen so far on my friends' broadcasts. It s genuinely a fun experience especially with your mates.
1;I highly recommend this game it is a fast paced horror game and is worth what you pay for it. The only problem is with the characters I feel it would be an extremely immersive experience if you could create your own character andunfortunately thatis not an option. Otherwise it is an extremely good game I hope this review was helpful.
1;Really good and fun game! only negative I have with it is that 70% of the time you can't connect to a game as a survivor and the game crashes I've spent 10mins opening and closing the game just trying to get connected. This needs to be fixed! I've never owned a game with such connection issues! But when it works its good.
1;Okay so obviously this game will have some problems like any other game this game is great it is a good concept they only issue I seem to have with the game is that the lobby isnt loading me into a game properly HOWEVER there is quiet a simple fix for that and it actually resolves the issue other than that I love this game and I recommend it.
1;"""This game is worth the buy. I do think they need to be careful because they're steadily walking into to """"pay to win"""" but so far they have done an excellent job at paying attention to what the players want and implementing it as well as implement additional content that improves the game. A lot of games charge for additional content before it's even finished but the devs for DBD haven't even come close to that."""
1;This game is a great game. As many online games there are toxic people and there are people who arent great at the game. Dont let the toxicity ruin the game. It is very fun. There are some bugs but they fix them fairly quick. The devs are doing their best and thats what matters.
1;Product received for free. That game makes alot of fun and i thing it should be added like an mechanic guy like an old dwight or jake that would be great with a perk which does like you can repair 1 gen instant per round/at the end and you can find more often in chests the box that would be so amazing i love this game
1;This game is an amazing experience and has amazing elements for example the level blood point system works in rewarding/supporting manner. The maps have high detail causing full on real feel environment leading to a thrilling bone chilling experience. The major issue I had is load times due lack of killer based population and user internet problems even if you have a great connection. Overall I give this game 8 out of 10 stars.Thank you for making this game happen
1;Ten outta ten for making one rage Ten outta ten for satisfaction when you kill that one annoying player or get away from a good killerTen outta ten would play againStill playing and havent been drawn away. Massively fun with friends and looking forward to the next dlc D
1;Absolutely amazing game. It still has its bugs and balance issues but that is to be expected from such a relatively new game. I can't wait to see the new features they plan on adding and watching this game take shape.Overall the feel of being in a horror film was perfectly captured! I would rate this game a solid 10/10 for its fun gameplay and great potential. It has worked its way into my favorites list.
1;The more DLC That is made the less thought through the characters become why is this? I Personally couldnt say but if you have to buy this game and then cant have fun because DLC users are overpowered because they BOUGHT the DLC I dont recommend this game. Btw if you are willing to buy the DLC and the game you may or may not lose interest in the either frustrating unfair ranked matches or the unfair overpower wins as the killer but thats up to you.
1;Dead by Daylight is so col game buy it to play togetherFIX your GAME i go to the EXIT i escape then the game bugg and CRASHSAY me The game is CRASHED i restard the GAME i am DEMOTED with 1 RANK ( full 3 pips)FIX YOUR GAME because the game is col and i want playTHIS is my favourite game i don't care it full of lags bugs and crashs and i am so good on it 1 RANk xD
1;The core concept of the game is amazing if you loved games such as L4D and Killing Floor you will no doubt enjoy this game as well.When this is said note that this game might be published as released though it has alot of problems with it's que and should propably be considdered Early Access it should here be said that the developers keep improving the game not only with new content but also with bugfixes and I am confident they will fix the queues eventually.
1;Really enjoying this game. The game was a little rough around the edges at first but the devs are doing a great job at supporting this game and listening to the community. The first DLC just dropped and on top of being fantastic it is also FREE...YES! Free DLC.....Great game a must buy for sure!!!After 40 hrs in I continue to love this game. Sure its not perfect and the graphics arent amazing by any means but amazing graphics arent always important...this game is just FUN!!!
1;"""Dead By Daylight can be summed up in one quote from Far Cry 3 """" Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same ing thing... over and over again expecting... to change... That. Is."""" Vaas 2012so if you like that line then buy this"""
1;Overall it's a good game and I would highly recommend this game regardless of the sale price. I've gotten hundreds of hours of entertainment already and it just keeps getting more content. The gameplay itself at times can be more addictive than anything else and it can also be extremely frustrating. But that's the nature of online competitive games right?Get in here and start hooking or start surviving.
1;Honestly I won't lie this game does have some problems that need to be worked on like matchmaking some bugs etc. But I def would recommend this game to anyone. If you play with friends it makes the game so much funner. I love the whole idea of the game and the concept.
1;"""So i started playing the Game and i was like """"hmm...looks interesting i guess?"""" But now after 600h Playtime ( I think that says everything.) i can gladly say that this game is nearly perfect...There are some balance changes or other decisions from the Devs side i don't agree with but they are doing a pretty good job so far. So if your looking for a cool game which you can play with your friends or alone ( try Dead by Daylight..."""
1;It takes a long while to get playing if I pair up with friends to survive not sure if it's a matchmaking management system thing or if they set it so that players that play alone end up with a higher priority to get into a killer's lobby. It's kind of annoying but the game itself is pretty dang fun. I'd say it's worth a purchase especially when it's on sale.Though I do wish I could get something out of killing my friends other than just practice.
1;Very glitch at this point to the point when I can't play the killer but I'm hoping the lobbies will get improved/fixed so that one day killer online will actually work for me ( Thryed everything to fix it as well as everything surggested to fix lobby bugs...
1;Dead By Daylight is a 1 vs 4 asymetrical hunt and survival game. One player is a killer who tries to hunt and kill 4 players who are survivers. The survivers must be stealthy and try to turn on generators which will then power on an exit for them to escape. The killer must find them and elimate them before this happens.If you ever played tag hide and seek or manhunt when you were a child this is that. Only more brutal. I highly reccomend it.
1;This game is heavily favored towards the killer no matter what ppl say bc i have played both survivor and killer and its a 50/50 with survivor but as killer u always kill at least 3 ppl bc every time i have played killer it was so easy and ppl said the nurse was hard to play and i played her for my first time and downed everybody within the first minute. The only reason killer mains get salty is bc they r so op they go in expecting to kill everybody and when they dont the get mad.
1;"""Beautiful game I've always wanted something like this and I have been waiting for Friday the 13th game but this will do for now I do wish it had a little more open world sometimes it does feel cramped and or a better way to communicate with your fellow survivors """"unless you have teamspeak"""" but overall I really enjoyed this game I played the crap out of it during the beta launch"""
1;Fun game in general not as buggy as it used to be and chasing around survivors is something I can easily do for hours. Game feels pretty complete with the dlc out have only encountered one major bug since the patch and that's in about 10 hours of play. A game well worth playing especially if you have 3 4 friends to survive with or hunt down.
1;This game is funny ! good game good idea but the ing invisible murderer is so hard to survivors. please fix it NERF INVISIBLE ASSASSIN. WHY THE ASSASSIN CAN SEE THE SURVIVOR TYPE LVL AND ITEMS BUT SURVIVOR CAN NOT SEE THE ASSASSIN ? THAT SUCK BRO ! ( INVISIBLE ASSASSIN SUCKS !!! ) PLEASE NEEEEERFFFF THAT TRASH BUSH ETC
1;I really enjoy this game yes it may have some glitches and bugs but the devs are quick to respond if you people report it to them and yes there is a lot of killers that like to camp and a lot of survivors that like to use jungle gyms but it's part of the game you just gotta learn how your opponent plays and learn to counter them just like any other game. This is a really fun game.
1;Very fun game however toxic SWFs are OP and will ruin your fun. If you win they cry and make 2747274897 excuses for why it's your fault and you played unfairly. You lose and they will call you a trash killer constantly. If salt doesn't offend you you will love this game.
1;Love the game only Juan complaint....Mah DweardI really need one and can't go to Pax like many so one way to get the Dweard for free is...Play DWIGHT!No one likes Dwight! You will be tunnel visioned the entire game and grow a Dweard!Your Welcome DBD Fans!
1;This game is awesome. Lobby errors plague the game and small things but they are getting less rare. If you are ok with ignoring the frustrations this game is ing fantastic. I think the devs have a lot of contact/interaction with the community which is also good. Hard to rate cause of the small issues but the actual game itself is A1. So awesome i decided to write my first review ever
1;me and 1 guy left hes waiting for me to die because he see hatch guy is level 10 and im level 20 sees guy getting in locker sees killer run to locker and spam crouch and run into it trying to tell them theres someone in there killer hits me i fall killer open locker catches and hooks guy guy dies im bleeding to death killer picks me up i dont struggle he brings me to hook he changes his mind and brings me to hatch lets me escape10/10
1;The game good graphics and its gameplay I loved it really the developers working on the game and trying to make it better but the balance they have is still there camping and tunnelling the game leaves much to be desired with such rules invented by the people themselves. While I give this game but who knows what will happen next.
1;Good game I usually play survivor but killers need a buff mainly hag and wraith. Good gameplay queueing with friends takes hours personally with the new update I never had the infinite loading screen but some of my friends say they have if you are wanting to be scared the only scary killer is Michael Myers Evil Within tier 1/2 OK game with lots of potential.
1;team destroyed all the hooks in a cornerfriend ran therecouldnt get hookedkept wiggleing off as we got all the genneratorswe all ran to the corner to save my friend and open the dooor theredoor openedwe all crawled to victory one at a time as he hooked us10/10 would get called a c**t in after game chat againalsodrink bleach if you abuse infinites
1;i have a good idea for dead by daylight what if in doing so it is muck strange to find clothes in boxes or when the game round ends you could get a drop that so you could put it on steam market or swap it with friends P.S I am Danish and I love the game
1;Killer disconnect from game all survivors' rank dropped??!! What sort of bug is this? Matchmaking can wait up to 10 15 mins and yet to get into any match?! The lag issues OMG Seriously trust me you won't even know where when how you dead BECAUSE OF LAG!!! Quite Exciting &amp Fun will recommend if BUGSssSSssss are fixed please
1;Alright I love this game and i wont lie... This is my favorite game on steam and it has ever sence i bought it. I say you should buy this. I mean i havnt got bored of it yet and ive been playing for about a year now. Like suriously I love this game so much I still dont know how this game doesnt have more players. It really should have more players also thank the people who made this really really fun game. I think they made a great job of this game.
1;Great game. It might be grindy but developers are working on that for the next patch to be a little less like that. Speacking about developers they are not very bright and often break things after a patch but they are very active and listen to their comunity
1;Probably one of my favorite games currently the changes made to leveling make this game a WHOLE lot easier for newer players. If this goes on sale I'd say it should be one of your priorities to buy although the developers seem to listen to killers more than they do to the survivors its still fun.
1;Do you like running around in infinite circles?Do like map development with no real thought put into it?WELCOME TO DEAD BY DAYLIGHT!If you like a community where people and moan this is the game for you!Even comes with free DLC!Edit They fixed infinite loops added some nice features. I'm sold on it again.
1;It feels like a bade console port despite being a PC exclusive game. The developers' grasp on competitive balance seems tenuous and the balance changes and updates show it. The community is toxic with both survivors and killers raging over any perceived slight no matter how minimal.That said game is just plain fun to play. It's a good game and if the problems get improved it could be a great game.
1;its a fun game when i do play it i have fun whether its running in fear from the killer or chasing the helpless survivors but this one problem keeps popping up sometimes when i choose join lobbey it will say failed to join and if i click join again the game stays in the searching for game mode i cant escape and have to restart my computer other then that good game just get on that problem asap
1;"""So I've played 20+ hours of this mostly as the Survivor and I love it! You'll see a few negative reviews because there's no """"Survive With Friends"""" feature yet but it is coming. As far as the gameplay it's very tense and unpredictable. Also there's no in game chat between survivors. You never know if the survivors you're paired with will help you or leave you to die. I'm having a blast with this. I highly recommend this game! It's amazing now and it will only get better!"""
1;Played 1 match in 20 minute. The match lasted 3 min before I got hooked. All of the rest of the time was spent waiting to join lobby. I can't wait for version 3.0.1 when hopefully the have all the bugs worked out and I can actually play the game instead of looking at the lobby.
1;I don t really know what to say about this game. Is it a piece of shi t? YES! But it s also good in some ways. When it s not lagging in lobby or in game or when I just launch it. I hope they are doing something about these bugs cause they ruining the whole game. Jeez
1;There is a bug that escapes the score link window after escaping the Devade game. However if you do a forced termination you lose both the Blood Web Points and the Ranking Points. I feel a very big anger about it. This bug occurs in several games not just one time. There is a bug that can not escape from loading the game room. This is a forced termination. However this does not eliminate the BloodWeb points and ranking scores. But it feels like anger. I hope to solve it.
1;Don't take the game too seriously. The matchmaking is horribly imbalanced and lag favors the killer beyond all reason. The community is toxic never read chat unless you wanna get called a or told to kill yourself for being rank 20.The game is fun though when you get a balanced match but there is only ranked mode. Prepare to get trolled by survivors you literally never see for 30 seconds with toolkits using brand new parts. 3 generators will be done by the time you hook the first thing you saw.
1;Product received for free. Great game though I wish there was some type of different gamemodes or something for more variety. Also matchmaking is kind of broken still have to constantly mash the ready up button when playing survive with friends. PLEASE MAKE AN AUTO READY UP SYSTEM.
1;Meanwhile at the office Cot� lets check youtube to see if anyone playing our game is doing it right so we can ban them10 Minutes later Cot� Ok I think banning all the youtubers who Tbag exploit in kyf was a good idea.Cot� Pretty good job so far.Meanwhile Wall hackers who record Cot� looks like they are using our secret easter egg perks O
1;"""decided to play killer. waiting in lobby for four people to join.""""hmm i guess ill use the restroom while i wait""""*a minute later*""""huh nobody joined yet. alright! i'll do things to occupy time!""""*a few trips to mexico russia becomes the first man on mars then returns*""""nobody still? it ill be a survivor for the 100th time""""Best game ever"""
1;Please please add group party up mode for friends who want to survive together. Until then players with friends spend literally half or more of their time contantly joining and leaving games looking for their friends.Game is great but a failure in that sense until they fix it.Still recommend they will most likely fix this
1;Well great game have one of the most toxic community never fix the old bugs or even new ones. I still enjoy the game until now but not for long i think. Devs should do something about facecamp cancer bugs blah blah blah if you want your game stop dying )
1;"""Good game to """"chill"""" when you dont have anything to do fear factor stealthy gameplay optimized to run on any potato interesting characters (movies/RL inspired)Some issues I feel they need to be adressed little choice of maps sloppy controls repetitive balance issues (among killers) waiting time in lobby no punishment for quitters"""
1;Fun game until you cant drop pallets bc of poor connection or you magically get downed without anything happening and the killer hooks you in a split second. Fun game idea stupid bugs and coding. Fix your in game instead of creating new killers that aren't neccessary until the game is decent.
1;I've been playing for two weeks now. The game is awesome really awesome but there is a toxic community. Many times you'll get to the point of smashing your keyboard because of the noobs that will dc at the start of the match or right after the killer gets them or because the killer will be a noob facecamper. Also the other time a survivor was trolling me after I healed him/her. He/she was clicking unclicking and teabagging. The killer got me and I lost my rank.
1;Ive been one of their pioneer players and it will always be my go to horror game or if I am looking for some nice co op plays with my friends. No regrets once you learn how to be a good survivor/killer you'll be immersed in the world of dead by daylight
1;The game is great and for the price tag I would definitely recommend getting it especially in a sale. Just be prepared that if you are a killer survivors often will blame you if they die and send you hate they forget it's a horror PvP it's not supposed to be fair.
1;DBD would be a great game but it's far from perfect. Full of bugs &amp glitches however it's still one of my favourite 'cause of community and for a lot of fun. Nowadays there are bunch of jerks and so it's most likely impossible to get a possitive feedback nor compliment. Sometimes just gg is enough ) I spent so many hours and probably will keep playing for a while because i play games for fun.
1;Overall fun game even with all the bugs. It feels like the game is more survivor sided with there being more and more perks and balances to make the game easier for them. Really wish the devs added more things to make it fun. Like custom KYF where you could change the amount of survivors gens killers and have some community made maps. However in its current stance the game is a bit unbalanced and there are things that game could change.
1;I love this game. A lot of people whine about changes and such (or lack of) but it's a small company and the game is $20 be realistic. This game has a lot of replay value but seems very simple at first which is good as that makes it easy to get into and leaves plenty of depth to learn about as you play more.
1;I got this game a little while ago and I have to say very good! I played a few games and though I found it rather challenging I quickly became quite a lover of the game and play it frequently. Great job to all of the people who developed and continue to develop on this magnificent game and I can't wait to see where they take it.
1;The game itself is very nice. Easy to learn hard to master. You gotta learn all the perks and stuff. But here comes the community of this game (It s a total cancer). If you want to play killer without Hex Ruin then nope. You re gonna kill 1 person at most. The rank reset is a t too how a new player can play against some 2k hours killer? It s pretty decent but still needs a lot of changes and fixes. But still I love it.
1;Fun to screw around on or to take seriously but high ranks definitely are full of messing around. With some nice headphones it is pretty easy to get immersed in the tension matchmaking is great as well generally. As someone who is terrified of horror I enjoy this game's edge. Grouping with friends is fun but it does suck as killer to be against 4 man parties all the time. Overall highly recommend for anybody.
1;This is a really fun game. the only problems it has is that there is really long queue time for killer ATM.one of the most annoying things is that if you play with your friends you have to reinvite them after each game and that really sucks. otherwise it's really really fun
1;Great Horror Game A+++++This Game Is So Good It Makes Me Feel Like Im In The Game itselfThe Survivors Have A Great BackStory And They're Abilitys Are Really Useful To SurviveThe KIllers Put A Challenge To The Survivors To Make Them Work Hard And Make Them Focus And Makes The Survivors Use TeamworkAnd This Is Why The Game Is Great
1;Dead by daylight is a fun and interacting game where 4 survivours have to do 5 generators in order to escape the trial. I enjoy this game because its a family friendly game except if you are playing against a nurse thats just straight up bullying. I enjoy 360ing the killer and pallet looping him. My favorite part is at the end where you get to chat with the killer it sometimes gets heated up. Its a great game.
1;"""A 1 vs 4 game an interesting concept as I thought when it came out.Game has lots of bugs updates which """"fix"""" them though kinda not.Reeeaaaaally hate campers but noone pays attention to them by them I mean game developers.If there are no campers it's a really fun game.And with friends it's really good.Though the game is rather pricey better buy it on sale"""
1;i like the game and with out a second thought i would say that i have suck up to this game BUT and that i big but i had enough of these review that are about the windows and wooden blocks it can be hard beening the killer and the survivor. with that said if someone leaves or DC they should be penalice for it. with that said this game just came out of baiter and they only had one map and one killer so there going to be things that need to be fixs
1;My cousin Reyaad Malaka got so scared of this game that he refunded it. If you enjoy horror games I suggest you try this one out. I have experienced no bugs long matchmaking times or any problems with the game. The only downside of the game would be that you need at least one or more friends to play with. Otherwise the gameplay feels fresh along with a variety of killers maps and strategies you can utilize. It actually makes you feel as if you were in a horror movie.
1;Dead by Daylight keeps disconnecting me and I don't know what to do please help because it happened after the new update came out. I start in a lobby and then couple minutes later 3 people disconnect leaving one person left and its so annoying. Please Help me fix this someone.
1;The game is very well build aside from all the crazy glitches in the game! i really enjoy it but to be honest the community on this game is just There's always so much hate going on in the game. Blaming other survivors or the killer for mistakes that you made But other than that this game is great.
1;in my view this game is great. its a new experience to the gaming world and i can see it develope more i play it. It has its sucky moments to like glitching through walls and map but you get use to it. Camping isn't wrong but it make everone mad but hopefully the Devs. fix that. As so i like this game and give it a try. see you in the fog.
1;I love this game. Its easily my favorite game. This game will keep you entertained for hours days months possibly even years. Each round is different and there's many killers and survivors to choose from. Each killer has different powers and perks and its really fun to go against these different killers. My only complaint about this game is that the community can be very toxic at times.
1;Awesome game! always get's intense when playing and gives you abit of a adrenalin rush haha. Only down side is sometimes you need to search for a game a couple of times due to matchaking problems. It's cool how you can play against mates or survive with them but half the time matchmaking with friends wont work.
1;The gameplay and game concept is amazing. There are a handful of bugs but I have been playing the game for about 2 years now I think and the developers are constantly fixing and improving the game. Most importantly it is one of those games that I find myself playing all throughout the year. Its replayability is great and the gamplay is constantly challenging and rewarding. GET IT NOW!
1;Play hide and seek when you was a kid? Imagine that but with death and creapy monster hunting you down!At first it is scary.. you get nervous when the killer gets close to you. But when you plya mroe and more you get use to it. One tip for new players (survivors). Play the game expecting to die if you escape etc its a bonus!
1;I personally love dead by daylight and support anyone who plays it. i've tried to get my friends to play but they won't. Ilike this game because you can tell there anways adding new killer and survivors and their not going to stop any time soon. I rate this game 10/10
1;Saw DLC is way overpowered for the Killer (where did the heartbeat go? i'm getting smashed without ANY warning all the time). Why bring BS without a well balanced and well overthought gameplay? Doesn't make any sense for me. I'm reaching the point of playing without ANY gear because i know im gonna lose it all. Unless i have a FREAKIN good survivor team. Exactly the same complaints since the game was launched. For now i'll quit any game with the saw DLC. Waste of time.
1;The game is great and lots of fun but honestly i would not recommend the game in its current state! The game always freezes on me when im trying to join a freaking match ! literally have to close the game and relaunch it and it's just a repetitve cycle. They NEED TO FIX THE BUGS WHEN FINDING MATCHES !!!! SOOOOO FRUSTRATINGEDIT The game is now fixed. it only freezes on me every like 10th game instead of 10 before 1 match the game is really fun and addicting
1;this game is so much fun but devs can be downy sometimes with updates especially since I IN HATE STANDOFFS THEYRE SO ANNOYING YOU CAN LITTERALLY STAY THERE FOR DAYS AND THE LOSER WILL JUST SIT ON THE HATCH LIKE THATS NOT FUN AT ALL DEVS CMON WTF. other than that pretty decent game.
1;great game overall however i would like dedicated servers rather than the killer hosting it it is so laggy if you get the wrong killer and it's not your fault! thankfully ping testing is a thing whitch works 90 percent of time but the rest of the game is great
1;Just got the game a few nights ago and played 5 hours with a few friends. It is fun...until you run into hackers. . . I get there are perks but I know there is not one that shows the killer right where other players are. Great expirience if you want to play only with your friends and no randoms. Wish it was different but I guess it is what it is. Still worth it! Just not worth the time in ranked matches.
1;The match making if awful rank 20 survivors against rank 1 assassin. I do think that s a big deal. Also it s hard to find a match when playing with friends. Not fair that if the assassin leaves the match you get only the points you ve done so far. People still get kicked out when the game is starting so you end up with 3 survivors and a good ranked assassin. The idea of the game if really good but fixing the match making would make it so much more enjoyable.
1;I like the game. I just recommend If you can nerf the time limit for Michael Myers I think its to long for the insta down. other than that its a fun game you get to play with your friends and try to survive till the end fix all generators and open the gate was a good idea. Also i would like if there was a perk for the killers that when the hatch opens it only last for a certant amount of time but you can only get it by the shards.
1;toxic player like me .Noobs.lot of bugs.don't buy this stupid game.i have 600h and this game is so stupid and cance. players are toxic and have a scramble brain.killers are not balaced are so f**king easy to kill a survivor and i se myers with chainsaw nurse with chansaw and the DLC are so ing broken like freddy like doctor myers leatherface and the survivors are so hard to play to survivor and killer are so op and easy.and you can get ban so easy.dont buy this game
1;11/10 very balanced game from the very first release until now the developers have been buffing the Killer and nerfing the Survivors.Probably this is the reason why the community has dropped so much and it takes about 5 minutes to make a bloody match.And if you accidentaly join a fricking match the killer disconnects..The game is one of my favourites but the waiting is really killing me.
1;Ever since the game's license was acquired by the developer the game has just been getting better and better! The devs have shown their commitment to improving the game a commitment driven by genuine passion and love of their product.However in it's current state it still has some of the issues that have plagued it from day one maybe wait for a sale unless you really love asymmetrical horror games because of the current offerings I'd say this one is the best.
1;Super fun. They're are some people on this game who exploit minor bugs and some who go out of their way to be unsportsmanlike by 'tunnelling the same person' (Following the same person all game to kill them specifically) and then others who use bugs to cheat and make the killer leave but if you get some great teammates then you can easily have fun
1;if you're looking for a game that basically simulates being in a movie then dead by daylight is the right game for you.Dead by Daylight is a game where you have to accomplish certain objectives to escape there's an indication when the killer is near which are heartbeats. there are tutorials when you first launch the game that'll teach you the basics of the game good luck campers (or killers)
1;Fun game when you can actually get into a game. Half the time you will spend is searching for a lobby. There should be an afk check before the game in lobby and while searching for a lobby this will reduce queue times and player in game afk/disconnects.
1;This game is freaking awesome getting to play a off serial killer that sacrifices you to dark gods or playing as 4 pissy little pubescent teens trying to hide from him pretty awesome if you ask me so overall this game is awesome just a little glitchy here and there fulfill your dream and murder people you don't or never liked!! xD
1;Dead by daylight is a fun co op horror game best played with friends.It is quite a grind to get good perks and items etc but there are addons which give you more bloodpoints(the currency)In conclusion it is a great game i reccommend this to horror fans
1;Love this game i think its an awesome concept and is being executed very well. however the queing system is absolute garbage if you have a survivour party the is more than just yourself. and anyone willing to pay 7 dollars for michael myers has essentially won every game they will ever play as killer.
1;I love it when I get face camped by the killer. Or tunneled by the killer. And I basically die instantlyBut then I remember there are more toxic things in this game like flashlighs or d strike or pallett loopingSo the killer dc's and I de rankRlly fun game11/10Would get face camped again
1;"""Improve report system of people who disrespect killers ) because right know i see zero respect from survivors after the trial ends ) F.E When survivor survive (Rank 19) he/she acts level head pretending that he/she is pro and then words """"n**b"""" * """"idiot"""" ect apears in the chatAnother notice Mostly i see russian people disprespect killer after the trial. I am more survivor player."""
1;"""This game is super addictive and awesome. However the matchmaking is terrible! It takes so long to find a game and there is only one way to join a lobby. Each time I click on """"join a lobby"""" it either says it failed to join or it'll seem like it finds a game but shortly takes me back to the same screen. I really wish there was a way to make this a more efficient matchmaking. I would rate this game 5 stars if it weren't for that issue. Please look into this!"""
1;2 generators left2 survivors left to killfound one survivor he is juking me but still manage to get a hitstill juking me around a house i finally about get the down hitslashes hammer Falls off the mapGG will fall off the map againEven tho there are bugs and dcs they just need to fix that and thats it
1;Been playing this game for two years absolutely in love with it and don't plan on quitting. Every match has it's own unique interactions and never ceases to amaze me. Only bad thing I'd have to point out in this game is Survivor Salt and Survivor entitlement. Stick through it soon to be Killer mains!
1;Besides how hard it is to get into a game (sometimes) this game is awesome. I was obsessed with it when I first got it and now I can never stop playing it. Whether the match goes in my favor or not it's just such a fun game in general and I love the challenges the game has. Good good game I HIGHLY reccommend it.
1;this is a pretty good loading screen simulator if I was working on a game I would definitely have the loading screen DOWN! Of the 220 hours I have probably under 1/3 was waiting in a queue. As for the gameplay when I'm not playing the nurse (lagging my off blinking around) it is actually pretty fun.10/10
1;It makes a lot of fun... when you are good and play the game since a long time (me 380h). But there are so many bugs and now while the summer bbq event you arent able to play the game it's just not letting you go in the main menu.Thanks a lot for the dumbest devs in the world.
1;"""Was rank 18 solo survivor against a rank 20 Pig.Escaped from the killer 2 times and ended the match by going in the hatch.Got called as a """"fxxking hacker"""" """"a hacking noob fa**ot"""" my families and ancesters cursed.999/10 would escape through hatch again"""
1;its a very fun game! the devs do weekly streams and will update the game fix it and try to put out new content and dlcs. every game will have toxicity in it but ive found some friends and players that are fun to play with. swf is really fun and so is killer please try out both and play both for a good 100 hours before you complain about the other side you can still be a killer or survivvor main but jjust try to understand the other side.
1;Very fun to play both sides but you will occasionally face bad killers that literally camp hooked players making it impossible to save the hooked player. Meanwhile the remaining players do the generators and still win the game. Still Very annoying for the surviving side. Also there are some very strong perks that can give you wallhack almost but these are very rare. Also fun to play with friends (so you can ensure that you have rather competent and fair players D )
1;It's good by the sound you will always get fear but this is not the game like you will spend 5hours straight its just like you can play it if your boring on other games and play it like 3hours8/10 or 9/10 but idk the game is goodSo i edit it i got addicted in to this game not what i like said on the first one if you get the right play you will be addicted as survivor and play it and play it again 10/10
1;Pretty damn good game after updates and changes to some perks there is still issues surrounding the game but I mean what game doesnt have its issues. Overall I have encountered no game breaking stuff or anything that has made the game less fun. Killer can be agrivating at first but you learn as you go and gain new perks and get better. Overall I give this a 8.5/10. Fun to hop on every now and then.
1;Product received for free. Dead by Daylight people must fix a bug that the killer gets stuck in the pale when it takes a survivor and the one that does not take the exit and you have to go through the trapdoor.See my profile to see what the killer will upload the photos now
1;BugSo I have played the killer and everything would be nice if I could hook the survivors somewhere else that the cellar.I don't know why but all hook ecept that in the cellar were invisibal and I couldn't hook anybody on it.The only thing I could see were the christmas lamps from the hook but the hook itself wasn't there.
1;"""I enjoy this game. Match making needs to be fixed and we doo need the option to have our own key bindings as well as join public games with our friends. But as its still pretty early I'm not going to knock the game for it. It can be very suspensful and theres plenty of """"Oh """" moments to be had. If you like spoopy games this one is worth a try."""
1;Ignore the haters no asymmetric game is perfectly balanced but this one is fun an interesting up unti lthe point of you being a borderline professional at which point you need to reevaluate some life choices. Getting spam bad reviews because of some balance changes that as per usual have rustled some jimmies.
1;Its a realy nice Game makes lots of fun ! Soundtrack + Gameplay as Survivor / Killer + Nice Levels + To add ons +Very nice game but at start for beginners a little hard cause the need first grind his Perks what can help tham to survive or increase his chance to survive.This Game will bring you lots of fun and maybe scare u try it out !!!
1;Dead by Daylight. An intense game of cat and mouse. Either an stressful attempt to keep you and your team alive or a brutal game of playing with your food and hunting your pray. dead by daylight is a fun game which ever way you play it as a survivor or a killer although at times can be a little glitchy.
1;"""The amount of fun I had on this game was insane yes there are a few people who ruin the experience in some matches by leaving early or just be a**holes but hey isn't that all online games?Pro tip nothing strikes fear into the heart of killers more than """"The Helicopter"""" (picture a downed survivor spinning on the spot like a rotor blade)."""
1;Great game that will keep u on the edge of your seat if you're a survivor that is. Only downside i can think of is the crashing every now and then when trying to play with friends it just takes you back to the main lobby and you have to invite/get invited again. Haven't experienced this with random players though.Still good game and great for cardiovascular exercise would develop spontaneous arrhythmia at the sight of Michael Myers again/10
1;Do you like playing games that make you salty? This is the game for you. Play killer? Going to be salty. Play survivor. Yup. No matter what side you play players in the community will always have something to complain about how you play. Fun game though.
1;If I could say one bad thing about this game it would only be that there are hackers in this game. Dead By Daylight is possibly one of the greatest survival horror games out there. Not only that The developers are such nice folks and kind hearted. If you're looking into buying Dead By Daylight do it.
1;I like this game but they should add more modes other than trying to start all the generators and escaping. A really easy example is one where you try to survive the killer for as long as possible they could even try something like a multi killer gamemode with more survivors aswell. Anyways it's a good game worth the money just a bit bland.
1;DBD is a 4 v 1 game with the killer against survivors but its duable for the survivors with the techniques of 360 180 flashlight saves and much more. Being good at this game will definetively get you juking a killer. Well in other wise if you're lucky go for attempting to escape the hook . (im not going to end this review because i don't have time)
1;This game is an addiction. You know its bad for you. It makes you question what you're doing with your life... and it enfuriates you... but you keep coming back for more like the masochist your psychologist told you you were. If you like a frequently bugged and broken game that you can't walk away from this is for you!!!!
1;After months of playing Dead by Daylight no doubt in my mind that I enjoyed it. Very fun concept of a game but can get repetitive for some. This game has many exploits and bugs but the devs constantly patch it in order to please the fans. With every patch comes a new bug or exploit. There isn't any dedicated servers the connection will be depended on the host which is the killer. Despite all of the exploits bugs and annoying fanbase this game is straight up fun to play.
1;Eclipsing over 400+ hours in this game I can honestly say it's been a overall positive ride. The only real complaint at this point is top tier killer balance. High level Nurse and HB play is broken.Otherwise would TB before jumping down the hatch again. 10/10.
1;Product received for free. I really like the risky ness of this game and the intensity. I also enjoy how each game has a new feel and its own flow. Dead by Daylight combines a scary game with some funny scenarios. I play Survivor more often than killer but I enjoy doing both so far. They continue to update and balance the game as well as they can and are leaning toward creating something great!.
1;I'm just gonna say OMG this game is so much fun and you get so pumped up! Love that they had it for free during this weekend and that my brothers told me about it. We had so much fun playing this game! BUTI lost my progress once and had to leavel up all my characters again. I did mail and did not get anything back a long while ago. Well well I do good without anything but its just sad to loose everything you worked hard for .
1;Its a nice game with many diffrent killers and survivors. Each Killer is diffrent and needs another style to play. But this game has some Bugs and the Devs try to fix them and make this game more than awsome. I love this game and can deffinitly say Best Game for me!
1;This game has come a long way since its release. Its had its ups and its definately had its downs. But somehow it still remains one of the best 4v1 games on not only Steam but also console. I adore this game and I give every one of you reading this the urge to play this game and enjoy it as much as I have.
1;Great game ! Pros Its very fun It is well optimized You can play with friends easy I love the graphicscons Bugs Campers.I really reccomend this game to all it is not too scary but its fun i dont like how there can be some .The game does have bugs but it is only a game that has been out for 7 months so give it a rest I recomend this game.
1;This game has come a long way since its release. They have really fixed a bunch of issues and bugs that made it nearly impossible to play. You can tell they have been listening to the fans of the game. The gameplay never gets old and the fact that they added Halloween and Michael Myers akes it that much more fun!
1;The only downfall to this game is how long matchmaking takes. If you solo queue in a quick play then it is alright but if you try to play with your friends it doesn't matter if you have a for party or not matchmaking just seems to take forever. The game mechanics are good. And is evenly matched when it comes to matchmaking. Please fix the matchmaking times because this game has been out for a yearor so and still having the same problem.
1;This game is awesome. Ignore the people complaining about individual mechanics and stuff like that. The devs are constantly updating the game with patches and gameplay tweaks alike and for as long as I've been playing the game (a long time) I have always been able to escape as a survivor or kill as a killer. If you're looking for a different kind of multiplayer experience then this is the game for you.
1;It is a pretty fun game a little scary at first but you get used to it. I recommend using headphones when playing because there a lot of audio cues that can be very helpful once you understand how they work. It can be a little laggy and sometimes has a long wait time to find a room. Overall its a pretty fun game that makes people play mind games on the killer or the other way around. I highly recommend this game.
1;I have had so much fun playing 400+ hours in this game and I am not even close to being tired of playing it yet and I'd say that's worth $20. The game does have bugs and its not entirly balanced but it's a lot of fun. It also may be hard for new players to get into it because the grind is steep but it's worth it.
1;A couple of glitches here and there and sometimes quite a bit of lag depending on the host. However it is one hella scary game with nice mechanics and characters. Good level system cool skins maps and one heck of an atmospheric vibe with the music and heartbeat combined and just the general sound.

1;I love this game! it's fun its spooky it's an adrenaline rush. most of the people complaining don't put the time into the game and give up after the smallest bug or probably a killer who can't counter a window/pallet hopper. i love this game so much i can't stop playing it!

1;Speaking from a Killer's perspective!This game has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay. Learning the basics and getting more and more refined in your gameplay and perks is alot of fun. Climbing up ranks is not too challenging even when you play versus lvl 1 (highest lvl) survivors its still manageable and a lot of fun. For 20 bucks totally worth a buy for me.
1;I bought this game like one month ago and I can say that this game is amazing. I have 145h in it and you never get bored because of the content.. There's always a new killer with some new tactics new teammates with other perks.. Now I am rank 1 survivor and rank 6 killer. 10/10 for this game! JUST BUY IT you won't regret your decision!
1;I hope to the hag's perks has more useful. it more depended on totem. (lighted candel totem) I recommend about it that detroy all totem not one lighted candel totem to dismagic the hag's perk or lighted candel totem can self recovery. I hope that be the hag is more playful killer.
1;Pretty fun game whether you're playing alone or with friends if you're into fast pase hide and seek type horror games this is the game for you. Admitably there are some bugs within the game but if the developers looked into them they should be an easy fix. One of them being that if you do play with a party of friends you have to re send an invite every game you play. But asides from that fun game!
1;This game is still in BETA despite being launched in my opinion. However if you like glitchy funny games that will be fixed in the future soon buy it. I told myself that this game would die quickly but I have fun playing with and without friends and I'm glad I gave it a chance.
1;When i bought this game i had already heard of alot of people playing it and some twitch streamers playing. This game is very easy to learn and fun to play. It is more of an arcade game but has decent amount of progression in skills and leveling up characters. It is still fairly new and has many bugs (not gamebreaking) but it seems they are being addressed one by one.
1;I love this game. I own all the DLC I bought it to support the devs and unlock the new killers. This game does have flaws. There are animated parodys all over youtube of all of the flaws this a game has. The devs really work hard at getting rid of these bugs most of them have been fixed (New ones show up now and then though). It's really alot of fun and if it's on sale you need to buy it.
1;I honestly didn't expect much from this game but I am having a blast! Being a survivor is geinuinely firghtening and very intense to try and not only survive but decide whether to help other survivors. Being the killer frantic and a ton of fun. When I played as a survivor I felt like I stuck out like a sore thumb everywhere I went but it is quite amazing how much you don't see as the killer.Overall great fun!
1;I love this game but still the devs need to balance the game. Some killers use god addons and win in the first 2 minutes of the game or all of the survivors carry around toolboxes and genrush the mach. However the game is pretty fun and i would recomend you too buy all the dlc ( when on sale ) apart from Freddy that killer is a piece of
1;Want horror? Yes then it's for you.Want a break from RTS or shooters? Then yes it is for you.Want puzzles and t to be a reality? Welcome to the world baby.Want to play as a cerial killer? Then you're dream is a reality.This game is extremely good for everyone. If you want a break from other games then get this game! Also as a tip get the Deluxe edition if you have Payday 2 to get some free stuff.
1;I have spent a lot time with this game and it really delivers the thrill of the hunt both as killer and as survivor. It has had some problems with balancing and ingame issues but the devs are fixing stuff in every patch. Some problems still stand like randomly crashing games on several systems or lobby issues but this game still is just too much fun to let me not love it.
1;I find this game incredibly fun even with it's random bugs. The only problem i have with this game is the campers ESPECIALLY the face campers but that issue is slowly getting better. The graphics are good If your moniter isnt the size of a medium sized tv and the gameplay is really fun in my opinion.I would definatly recommend this game and i have already to friends.EDIT Some of the bugs are hilarious i once went most of the game floating.
1;"""Since the latest Patch came out and the killers where able to place traps etc. faster This game became Killers got buffed and survivors got nerved by changing thier addons.. Its nearly impossible for bot """"Tryhards"""" to survive and play this game... It was so much fun to play this game but now i m just getting angry everytime I play this..."""
1;This game is one of my favorite games. I spent the most time on this game (xbox and pc about 1000 hours) and i still love it. It's unique it's fun alone and with friends and it feels different almost every game. It is frustrating as a noob but becomes more bareable with the more perks and skills you acquire. 10/10 from me
1;With New Upgraded System New Patches New Weapons New Vehicles and the Ongoing Improvement Process this is the BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED.IRL You can tell me go to mountain to exercise hunt a rabbit skin it cook it and eat it I'll tell u go F*ack yourselves In this game I do this every single day to keep surviving 10/10
1;I know the game is buggy ( for it being out for 2 years) but I still can't get enough of it. I love this game and even though I might get mad and angry when a Michael HAS INFINITE ING EVIL WITHIN 3 AND JUDITHS TOMBSTONE I know I will still come back to play it. So please BUY THE GAME AND PLAY WITH ME PLEASE I AM LONELY.
1;"""now you may be thinking to yourself 'a game where four people try and survive against a terrible murderer? sign me up!""""its a ing liethe killer is the victim surrounded by four empowered black women with flashlights.and as all four victims make their escape you have to watch in dread as they stop to teabag you pressing their feminine ballsacks into your face. it was at that point i had started crying"""
1;At the beginning the game was pretty unplayable and unfun. Campers cheaters etc. Now the developers are trying their best to make this game as much playable as possible and I finally found this game entertaining and fun. I recommend now much more than I would ever had before it's current state.
1;I really love this game it fun and gives a nice mix of thrill and excitement either you play as a killer or survivor. also to play as/from both perspectives gives it a good variation and different feeling depending on what side you choose to play. what more fun it that as you play with other ppl online you never now what to expect and some time some really interesting stuff can happen too.
1;"""Best """"hunting"""" game available right now that doubles up as a thrill survival game. Developers are very engaged and active about what's happening DLCs and payment system have been great. Highly recommended for people who like asymmetric PvP survival games!PS Just have a good mentality ready to consume salt from entitled players mostly survivors."""
1;I really like this game it stands out. I don't know much about graphics and such so i will avoid saying anything about that. Adding the option to play against bots could be a great update so that new players could get a hang of it before getting slaughtered online. I wish that they would make some kind of penalty to the killer when said killer is camping at hooked survivors
1;Very much enjoying the latest patch. Unloved killers given a major boost bad perks being significantly improved to make the perk meta more interesting and the balance between killers and survivors is probably as good as it's ever been. Game has improved significantly since BHVR took full control and am looking forward to what they have in store for the future.Highly recommended.
1;People always complain... yes there are some bugs. Which game doesn't have bugs? The concept behind this game is awesome. My heart races the music and sounds make me panic sometimes.. I haven't had a horror movie feeling in a long time and this game gives it to me. Over all this game is well worth the money. I haven't been this addicted to game in a long time.
1;Super addictive game. Play mainly as a survivor and it is wayyyyy too hard to put this game down. Matchmaking isn't perfect but at least it is quick ) Developers are super responsive and listen to the comunity's feedback! Couldn't recomend this game any more!
1;"""With nearing 400 hours at the time of the review I know what I'm talking about when I summarise the game with this """"Good Game. Not So Good Devs."""" They're active but they do muck up. Alot. Alot Alot. Like took them months to fix a bug where match making was broken."""
1;takes elements from childhood games e.g.hide and seek and chase and throws them into a foggy area of death.great game that has genuine moments of panic tension and sheer enjoyment.still has some bugs but the devs keep on top of problems and do their best to sort them out in a timely fashion.BUY THIS GAME!!!
1;What a game!I find it very addicting. Maybe too much? )I prefer this to Friday 13th. (as the two get compared a lot)Right now I'm actually refreshing the page every hour or so to check if the new killer (the one from Saw movies) is in. Any time now... ) But yeah if you're on the fence unsure whether to buy it... do it. Just do it! ) Feed your inner serial killer.
1;Very good game. Fantastic atmosphere everything is perfect !There is only one thing that should be changed You get a derank when you are a survivor and the killer leaves ingame that should not be !But it's a very good game and i hope that more stuff will be coming out.
1;"""People are complaining just because they made it so survivors actually have to have some sort of game sense to win don't be discouraged by them if you are interested in the game and feel its on for a good price grab it. It isnt pay to win It isnt grind to win The community isnt """"super toxic""""Its just a fun game and a good experience and I pray that behaviour does not revert the changes they made this patch it was a very needed patch"""
1;Stopping by to leave a review because Survivor mains are currently having a tantrum actively trying to ruin the games reputation as a result of the recent and much needed buff to two killers that were otherwise unviable to play in the higher ranks. The game is very fun and while balance is still an issue the Developers are heading in the right direction.
1;You need a lot of patience for this game. There is a bit of a learning curve and even when you've learnt all you can you'll have a lot of bad games as surv and killer.This is a strategy game more than it is a horror game.It's flawed its got bugs its survivor sided in balance but its charming. You get hooked to it.
1;Great game! Although the game has its problems (p2p balance issues exploits?) its sertainly worth the money Give it some time tho the first few hours can be hard for both killer and survivor. Devs are still bringing new killers and survivors to the game. But whatsup with that Survive with friends lobby.. after every game you have to join eachother again. kinda anoying.8/10
1;I love dead by daylight its a really good game and i really do recommend playing it. its heart racing and keeps you at the edge of your seat. however i'm absolutly off at how the creaters made michale myres soooooooo OP that it doesn't give anybody any chance in surviving which completely ruins the game. I get that michale was hella OP in the movies but a game like this needs to be fair on both the killers and the survivors sides not a pay to win.
1;very fun game great conceptbut god damn sometimes I'll be loading games and lobbies for 30 minutes just bugging in and out and having infinite loading times without ever playing gamePlease fix glitches before adding even more buyable stuff while the base game barely worksinvest in servers pl0x
1;Overall a good horror game but there are still issues and bugs with the game. The devs try to patch/ fix but it takes time. Once you get past the rank 20s teammates face camping killers and bots you'll realize it's an OK game. It's just a game try to enjoy it. I really enjoy playing 4 man SWF.
1;"""Great game but I feel the devs need to focus on fixing the bugs and server connectivity issues before releasing anymore useless DLC. Me and my buddy have more luck getting into a game together by random queue than actually playing """"survive with friends"""". Kind of ridiculous in my opinion. Overall I really enjoy the game though."""
1;Let's keep this short this game is for you if &gt you're an sadistic psychopath who likes to creep the out of other people &gt you're an sneaky stealth ninja with 1337 run&amp hide skillz &gt you're addicted to some serious bloodrush and adrenaline attacksand yes its totally worth it.
1;Great game overall but really buggy even this long after release. Devs should fix the bugs then deal with balancing issues afterward rather than just release new dlcs without fixing the core game issues. It's concerning how many people lose their data I personally deal more with infinite load times and always we lose 1 survivor at the start of a match so most my games 3 survivor vs killer which sucks.
1;I bought this game a few days ago and I'm hooked. I have played both roles as the killer and survivor and they are equally exciting. I love how challenging it can be in both roles to out smart the other and it really gets exciting when the chase is on! The only thing I wish they would fix is the the trappers had limitations to setting traps under the sacrifices and the lobby/joining game bugs and crashes. But other than that it balances out well for both sides. Amazing game worth the money!!!!
1;The game is alot of fun however as the game is undergoing active development still you need to understand that the game is in an evolving state and the content will be changing. be it minor or major change.But at this point this game is a riot for group play and still really fun solo.
1;It's hell good. I just have some problems about the promotion. It's so unfair that I lose promotion points because of a lot of people dont understand that helping each other is the core objective to escape.....matchmaking is so shuffled sometimes i get rookies sometimes i get pros...idk what depends on that. Anyway the game is perfect.
1;Outsmarting Simulator 201X ) it's a blast to play moderate learning curve (good thing! creates rewarding &amp enjoyable progression). High level play is all about mindgames the ability to preform split second deductions and subsequently adapt all with a timer ticking away in your head regarding a Trial's (match) various windows of opportunity.
1;They keep adding in new content which is great and they try to listen to the community which is also great. Only down side is the toxic community and slick learning curve thats abusive with toxic people.7/10 heckin spookyEdit Devs keep updating the game for the worst as of now. Lotta features broken and others diluted. 5/10 Heckin Spooky Patches
1;"""I do know that I don't have many ours on the game compared to everybody else but hear me out. It is a fun game however yes I know it has it's problems which can make the game less fun. But when it's fun it's really damn fun. You won't run into those """"perfect games"""" everytime but if you're skilled enough you should be able to win. It is fun."""
1;Game is fun alone but very fun with friends even though Friday 13 murdered this game like it was my lightwork for a little bit it is starting to come back the developers always update and the killers are nice except the PIG this killer is ridiculously sneaky even sneakier than the survivors please give the Pig a terror radius because the Pig has 3 abilities instead of 1 which includes Stealth Lunge Mask.
1;Pretty cool game especially after you invested some time in understanding everything in the game. Nice learning curve not to hard to start out with but becomes harder the more you play as for you get matched with people of your skill level. Besides that you get to either face your fears as a killer hunts you down or you get the pleasure of putting people on meathooks. Also praise the spidergod 10/10 would sacrifice againHail lord Dwight and sleep thight
1;How To off 99% of players as killer 1. Take first victim 2. Place victim on hook3. Directly just stare at victim while they stare back in rage4. Once victim dies repeat the same thing to the next victim and so on5.When taken to end lobby watch the puppets dance in the chat one by oneResult XD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;135h.4 survivors Hook one of them All 3 friends stay around hook You are not leaving Down another one 2 Friends running around hook You are not leaving Hooked one dies downed gets saved 2 escapes one hits you with an infinate juke spot.After 15 mins infinate bastard s up and you kill them.End of match.After the match you read 137 msg how bad you are becouse their friends died. becouse you didnt leave the hook when all 4 were in you sight.
1;Dead By Daylight is an amazing asykmetrical horrottlr experience although matchmaking can take a while and sometimes the rank ratios are unbalanced but the core gameplay is fun and worth it.To be honest if anyone tells you you are doing something wrong as killer most of the time keep doing it because if it pisses survivors off it is fine by me.Currently survivors on the whole are stronger than killer but hopefully the upcoming update will help a lot with how we play the game.
1;Ignore the salty survivor reviews cos they were and died this game is fun to play killer or survivor u can choose to be a and nt help people but that may make it worse for u when u try to survive work together unless ur killer then go ham on people and hook em like a butcher its great to play with friends and ull most likely survive more
1;spent 157 hours on this game stayed with it since the beta 10/10 would play again. In all seriousness I watched this game grow from being a new and glitchy prototype to a legit and FUN triple A level release. Best AND only horror game I play well worth the price.
1;First I would like to say I truly enjoy this game. Originally I am a console gamer but through out the years I have slowly shifted towards PC gaming. But today for the first time I (for some reason) am not able to play as a survivor or a killer. I know this is probably some bug but it needs to be fixed because I can only imagine what other gamers with this experience have to say about the matter. I will leave a thumbs up because I love this game but you NEED to fix this bug! Long live DBD...
1;While the gameplay is quite addicting the community is toxic. From egotistical killers to ignorant survivors this game has it all. I thoroughly enjoy the game when it isn't filled with campers and tunnelers I am a survivor main so that's what I see most of. But even though there is a pretty bad community the game is recommended in my book. There are glitches like anything and crashes but they're liveable. Definitely worth the $20.
1;Absolutly one of the most addictive games out there. Such a simple game yet so inutitive. However it could be considered a bit unbalanced at this point but devs are always working super hard to meet expectations and addresses issues quite rapidly. Even after a number of years it still feels like a fresh crsip game. I can only give this game my sincere recommendations!
1;Dead By Daylight have been updated too many times..This game was good but from some updates this game is getting badI love this concept of games but i think this game got destroyed with some updates..This game was fantastic but i prefer another games right now..I left dead by daylight community for 1 reason Getting ED UPI hope the old dbd is gonna come back &lt 3
1;Uhh all I have to say after playing this masterpiece.. is thank you developers for providing an experience like Dead by Daylight. Why hate on this game specifically I dunno I mean I know it has it's cons and a few hiccups but if you have the system to play it it's a really fun game.
1;This game is incredible. I have a computer that can play just about any game and I spend most of my gametime on this game. It's a very very very very addictive game once you get good at it... the updates are pretty constant and the developers seem to really care about the game and community. There are some toxic people but at the end of the day they're in every single game no matter what. This game is amazing and for only 20$ you'd be an idiot to not buy it. I promise you.
1;Product received for free. The game is very well made it has a unique concept that i really like. The best thing in this game is that you need to learn things and get used to them for being a good survivor. You need to learn jukes every update comes with new techniques every new perk every new killer that comes out changes the way to play and this makes it my favourite game.
1;Dear developers The game is awesome and based on a very creative and interesting concept and it was even better after you fixed the matchmaking. After the last patch or so I have to restart the game every time I want to play another match because I get stucked into an unlimited loading screen. Please fix this glitch it makes everyone willing to stop playing such a great game.
1;The Jason Game you've always wanted to play. fun as hell and makes you scream out like a 12 y old girl scout at a Justin Beiber concert. Survivor play through1. hide from killer2. start repairing generator.... 3. forgot to hit space bar... generator explodes Forced to hide.4. Oh god Oh god Oh god....... HE FOUND ME!!!!!!5. just when i think i get away he apears out of nowhere. 6. i get sacrificed to the spawn of the roaches....... 7. ready for next round
1;Great game i love it i'm so addicted to it tip for the people in survive with friends it happens very often that you wait hours its mostly cuz the region is unpopulated like The Netherlands try to change steam region to the USA or Russia in your steam settings and most of the time you're in very fast you don't have to restart steam even when it ask you to do it.
1;I'm in love with this game but it needs more bug fixing and other important things. After all it's a very good game and if you like this kind of games and you have a medium range pc i totally recommend you this game. ) Oh and I forgot to say what is killing this game...the fu***ng toxic community
1;Savage Jason inspired killer Competitive ranking system Selfish teammates Plenty of rage Join ranked games with friends Procedurally generated objective locations Teamwork Regular bugfixes/updates FeelsBadMan Savage meat hooks Bugs But hey it is good game buy it 9.5/10UPDATE 18/08/16Free DLC 10/10UPDATE 26/11/16Added less grindy leveling system
1;Absolutely bananas. What an amazing game. A little on the janky side but there are very few games that I can imagine that can halt my daily League of Legends addiction. I haven't played League in three weeks. So good. I look forward to them continuing to tweak and improve.
1;It has a really nice concept and the potential to be a really good game. At this time it's still buggy and has quite some issues but I still enjoy it nonethelessand I am expecting the developers to work out its shortcomings and technical issuesand deliver us a great game.I'd recommend it to fans of survival horror and especially to fans of slasher movies butnot to people who are expecting to play a finished and bug free game game at this time(Maybe after it comes out of Early Access).
1;Fun. Simple as that.HOWEVER. Survivors who make it their sole purpose to troll the killer kill this game. I've chased a single survivor who looped me over and over and over and spammed his little teabag crouch endlessly to tease me.KILLERS SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE THEY ARE A TOY. THATS HOW THIS GAME FEELS.If there was ever a mode that disable perks entirely that would be all I ever played. Perks ruin this game.
1;1000+ hours in and i still find the game enjoyable the community has its bad eggs but for the most part a lot of people are cool and not rude the games got a grind to it which is what makes it the most fun it keeps you coming back i would 100% recommend this to a friend and i have )
1;This update is suck.Is not the killer strong enough?You have traps you can blink you can be Invisible you can use a chainsaw.The humans can only run.Then what?Just run and die?Then was the fun part of be a survivor?Are you guys forcing everyone to be the killer?Buffer the killer over and over again.Are you afraid of the survivors will sacrifice the killer?
1;Been playing this game for 1k hours and still playing will get kinda bored once in a blur moon but the dev will suprise u with something new time over time.Just buy it and enjoy the game! Not a very nice community pretty toxic. But what do you expect from the internet world.Recommended!
1;This game has kept me coming back because of all the new and exciting content that is released on a somewhat regular basis. Sure it has it's flaws but that's what makes me love this game even more. If you're open minded to change and love survival horror/slasher style games this game is for you.
1;Be a Survivor and try to escape a player controlled enemy that is a KillerYou have a variety of skills and survivors available to choose from and its a pretty fun survival game.Playing the Killer you have to kill all the players trying to escape and you have a wide variety of different killers to choose from and they are all Unique with their own abilities.
1;Haven't played in a while but the DbD grind is the only game that i can say doesnt feel like a grind for me its very unique and the playstyle is PvP and very linear so if you like linear PvP this game is for you (like call of duty multiplayer). ONLY UPDATED THIS FOR THE NONIMATIONS
1;It look like as it is always the same but every time you play it it is different. Another killer makes all the differences in the words of the G Man.Also their politics is good in my opinion some DLC are free some you have to pay for but you do not need them to have fun. Every Thursday the developers give a one hour view behind the development of the game features that will come and more. Very good.
1;Most balanced the game has ever been. The pros of the game are that it's fun lobbies are usually pretty fast and it's pretty unique. The cons are that the community is pretty toxic there's a fair bit of grinding for the good perks (however only 2 or 3 of the meta perks are on dlcs that you HAVE to pay for and even then there's always the shrine) Overall I've put over 500 hours into the game and I still enjoy it so there's no way I could not recommend it.
1;Here's what you have to look forward to in Dead By Daylight Teams that have no idea what they're doingKillers that camp youSurvivors that farm youSurvivors that teabagSalt in the after game lobby almost no matter what.Salt in game causing survivors to rage quit. Bugs that have been around since launchExtreme lagOverall 12/10 would camp again.
1;Dead By Daylight is a fun and enjoyable game. Although the game has repetitive objectives actions/perks taken and used throughout the trial will make each match different in how everything plays out. My only complaint is the fact that the game's developers didn't do an 'acceptable' job of optimizing the game overall. This can create a noticeable amount of lag/drop on framerates at times (even with the best gaming equipment) which might hinder your progress during gameplay as killer or survivor.
1;Great game! I absolutely love it it is incredibly entertaining. However if you have major problems with lag be warned. It is nearly impossible to play with lag due to quick time events. I also wish they had been more upfront about the fact that you have to buy packs to gain certain content. If I had known I would have spent the money I had left on the Hag rather than another game.
1;this game is great fot people who like very tense horror games. your always wondering where the killer is and where you'r teamates are. and if your playing as the killer you have an overall feel of power over the victims. but since the killer has a 1st person view and the survivors have a 3rd person view the survivors can usualy see the killer before the killer sees them.I highly recomend this game.
1;Dead By Daylight Is one of my all time recommends! This game brings the fun multiplayer horror stratedy based games to a whole another level! I love playing this game with my friends and I think others do to. If you haven't tried this game out you should definitely do so!
1;i finally got to murder my friends so its good in my book. game got a lot of potential jokes aside tho. add an alien or something as a killer. put predator in and give him heat based/movement based vision or some put frank west in as a survivor and give him a perk that can let him like football tackle the killer to stun them or something man. this games a goldmine for ideas really
1;Amazing game with an amazing idea for this type of genre. 1 of the 3 killers is extremely overpowered and should be nerded but in the end its an amazing game except for the fact that some of the items/killers in the game are overpowered and should be nerfed.
1;well devs i think it is the time to stop campers PERMANENTLY!!!! I am thinkng of a circle around the survivor that is hooked and if the circle stays in that circle for more than 20 seconds he will be forced to leave the game the circle must be outside of his heartbeat range so please try and add this into the game to stop campers by a very harsh punishment
1;11/10 IGN I play all the time.Edit For real this game is great once you get into it. You may feel like the killers are over powered or suvivors are depending on who you play. But playing both side take knowlege of what you should be doing. If you do pick it up make sure keep at and don't go rage on the forums or reddit it just adds to toxicity in the comunity.
1;The best multiplayer game in the horror genre ....u can play alone and survive on ur own or just make friends and be a team player.the graphics are better now compared to the earlier version.The only flaw of this game is the bugs e.g. disconnection from lobby and game otherwise its 10/10 from me...i fully recommend this game to anyone nomatter which genre u love so buy it without giving a second's thought whether its on sale or not.
1;Good game dont let the bad reviews get to you. Sure the game has flaws but they do not out weigh the good this game has to offer. Most of the bad reviews are from players who just suck at the game and blame the game for their mistakes. This game is definitely worth the money.
1;If you dont want to get addicted to a game DO NOT buy this game.Everything about this game is 10/10 except for a bug the happens every 30 mins MAX. You go into an infinite loading screen try to join lobby or game can get frustrating... but who cares the game good enough to ignore the fact theres a bug.
1;This game is Early Access so it has its issue's but the devs are working on them.Despite the flaws in the game I personally (and everyone I know who owns the game) love it.The negative reviews are people who find the broken portions of the game too immense to overcome but trust me ... They just don't understand the meaning of early access.This game rocks. Buy it.
1;"""I have and will always love Dead by Daylight. It's a game with full potential!!However I do have one specific complaint. Campers. I understand that camping could be a """"technique"""" but FACEcamping? Really? Perks that combat facecamping/general camping are getting debuffs and it really feels like the game favors the killers more than making it equal... Making it not as fun to play survivor."""
1;Truly worth it price is nothing game has ton of content at least enough to spend hundreds of hours having fun gameplay is awesome and you should buy it ) I'd say It's not for everyone but watch some gameplay and if you like that kind of game just go for it )
1;The devs have finially stepped up and fixed all the bugs and issues I have had before. Its really nice to be finially able to play this game. Even though I do feel like generators get done super quickly sometimes as killer and super slowly as survivor. Who would of thought?It has issues but it is exstremly fun.
1;15 hours in and it's pretty fun. Aysymetrical gameplay where the killer is overpowered due to there being 4 survivors (hes not actually op in a meta sense). In its current form I would suggest only buying this if you have friends to play private games with.
1;AMazing game 9/10 definetlythere is some bugs but it is definetly worth it The fact that I cant lobby with friends does kinda me off since i bought 2 friends the game developers if u read this plz implement that u can 4 man lobby only as surviors just so u can play with friends it isnt game breaking for randoms if u are only 4 survivors and this would extend your game life a load
1;Great game balance is as good as can be expected in a game made to be unbalanced. Most of the people who cry about it need to get gud whether they play killer or survivor. There is really no limit to the cheeky things you can do to trick your opponents.
1;THIS GAME IS AWESOMEI know this game has a lot of matchmaking problemsI think the devs are trying to fix all of thatWhen its in gameplay it's good and needs to fix some things and placesaveragely this game v. goodI RATE it 9 or 8 1/2 out of 10Rate 9/10
1;Ooohhhh this game is good u should download it right away buy it the game is simple just play As a survivor or As an killer killer tries to kill survivors As the survivors Try to escape and survivors Need to power upp 5generators and the Can open the gates to escape or at 2 gend Done a hatch spawns in u Need a key but If u are the last One alive it opena automatically
1;FIX THE DAMN HIT BOXESThe only main thing that annoys me on this game besides from all the campers is the hit boxes on the characters. They can swing at you and it would look like they miss by a few feet but some how they damage you. This can also happen if the killer is facing away from you and if they're behind a tree.
1;One of the best games ive played in a while easily as a survivor your heart starts racing as soon as the killer starts chasing you until you get away then its the best feeling ever !As the killer you reign terror on the poor 4 sobs trying to escape simple but not so simple at the same time is to kill them any means necessary!! 10/10 for me
1;Ridiculously addicting. Love it and love to hate it.IMO Killers shouldn t be allowed to camp Dedicated servers would help with really dumb lag moments and ridiculously hard to judge hitboxes. Survivors shouldn t be able to be hurt while vaulting You shouldn t vault back over a pallet when facing away from it. You shouldn t pull down a pallet and be pulled to the killers side of the pallet.A lot of fun regardless of issues.
1;Really playable now the devs keep improving it.After roughly 100 hours I can say that the game is in a really playable state now. Expect a few rough edges along the way but if you can look over this the game is really intense.One small problem though there is no real tutorial only videos they cover only the basics.
1;This is the first horror expierence that is fun and makes you jump at the same time. Hearing that heartbeat increase and thud louder as the killer gets closer really puts you on edge. For best immersion... Turn off the lights Kappa. Only problem with the game so far is no party up system for online play with friends. Other than that this game is great and a recommened buy.
1;Thrilling and challenging. It's very easy to get yourself caught if you're trying to do things too quickly so take it easy folks. Wait for a moment that you know you are truly safe or truly screwed to break into a sprint. Very few bugs in this game as far as actual gameplay but the menu can get a bit freaky sometimes. You can play with friends now! So that's pretty awesomeAll around a good game to get your heart pumping with only light medium rage induced from gameplay.
1;"""Dank By Deadlight is a wonderful game. If you like seeing the back of your teammates' heads as they run through the exit gate leaving you on a hook or particularly enjoy the words """"failed to join a game """" this could be the game for you. On a more serious note this game is extremely enjoyable especially with friends and the devs do a great job fixing bugs. I highly recommend this game for $19.99 even in its current state."""
1;Despite mixed attention this is a geniunly great game. The only issue is the community can be a bit toxic at times. Otherwise it's a lot of fun. Devs do tend to focus more on killer adjust and buffs without a doubt but it's just the game getting harder for people that have been playing for a while. Face camping is my only gripe that needs some sort of solution.
1;I said I would change this review if they fixed this issue and they did so I have. I absolutely love this game now that they've really worked to iron out a lot of bugs. They've also done a lot of work on balancing and the new killers and maps they've released have been superb. The spirit that was just released in the latest DLC is phenomenal and one of the scariest killers in the game yet. I hope they continue and the game thrives for many years to come.
1;Got this game back in 2016 and played off and on until recently the game is in a good spot right now and is hopefully only going to get better I'd definitely a pick up if its on sale and if you have the money to spend then it might be worth it at regular price. It takes awhile to learn the community is pretty toxic though.
1;It's a very exciting game. I don't like online matches but this game makes me motivate.However this game still has many bugs and poor balance. Sound is very important in this game but recent sounds are not heard due to recent patches. I think that this is disadvantageous in killer play. Anyway I think this game is worth playing.
1;Bought Dead By Daylight on release.The game itself is fun and exciting but the queue times get very long if you queue up with more then 2 people.Also facecamp killers are very annoying to play against but most killers luckily don't do that anymore.Apart from that i definitely recommend this game.
1;(I would recommend to anyone.) I have put soo many hours into this game i enjoy this game way to much. I have all the dlc bought for this game and i will get more when the chance occurs. there are a few gliches but its nothing to bad to the point to where its not playable would recommend 10/10
1;"""Pros Little horror more in nervous good for timid player Good balance between surviver and killer RNG skill tree system(? (not sure abt the name but its kinda new to me) FunCons Ping issue people disconnect when losing (actually this is not good for both killer and surviver) Rank system make surviver """"chooses"""" good teamate (So newbies is hard to find a good partner to learn)8/10"""
1;Really fun game even though it has a lot of bugs and balancing issues currently you might notice a lot of negative reviews if you look you will see that most of the negative reviews have hundreds if not thousands of hours on the game yet they are not recommending it who would play a game they dislike for a thousand hours? The game is worth the money and all of the chapters are also worth the money the game has problems but they are worth dealing with because the game is addicting.
1;This is a really good game. I agree that it has lags but that's because it's still in development. This game is a diamond in the rough. I can never get bored of it. The devs are updating it with many new survivors modes killers. So this is something to look forward to. When this game is completely developed it will be even more awesome than it already is. So I recommend it.
1;Great game but the DLC adding Michael Myers made the game annoying since 90% of the games you will find he is the killer and he is a bit overpowered so the game starts to get frustrating. There should be an option where you get to choose at least one killer you don't want to play with.
1;More fun than Evolve ever could have been while still keeping the aspect of one vs many while giving him extraordinary powers. The atmosphere and feel to the game is very fitting just play in a dark room with headphones on and you'll be hooked into either the serial killer or survivor experience.
1;Product received for free. I don't fully reccomend this game for everyone. If you can deal with the frustration of being a new player and having no way of getting around killers because of the lack of perks and eventually getting the ones you need to do well in this game then it is worth the purchase. This game is fun but can be frustrating.
1;nice game there are some connections problem especially if you don't do a little spam test in the lobby's chat but everything stops here. Every survivor complaining about lag should've done the test in the lobby so it's not the killer's fault. The game has some bugs in the past there were some game breaking bugs which are now all been fixed and the end of the day i really like the game and have I have a lot of fun with it.
1;DBD is an awesome semi horror game that requires skills and and plan to escape alive. I've played this game for about 80+ hours and I love it. THe only thing I have to say bad about it is the fact that you can be a 20 survivoir rank and go up against killers that are a 1 rank.
1;I'm not going to give the game a negative review due to the community as you've probably already heard the community is extremely toxic (my steam profile comments can back this up) the game is pretty unbalanced and can become very frustrating after many hours of play. Still though the game is pretty popular has mostly positive reviews and I keep coming back to it why? Because it's fun and that is why i'm giving it a positive review.
1;I love this gameIt's not perfect and there are plenty of irritations but when it's good Oh my God what a rush your heart is pounding and it's truly scary.Worth dealing with all the BS toxic players and salty DCs just for those few fun filled games.Most players are friendly in chat and there's a great streaming community.Not sure why all the DLC is so expensive though.
1;If the two sides of this game stoped trying to call out the other side for inbalance maybe the developers would be able to actually focus on creating new and fresh ideas for the game.But your right why would i want a non toxic dbd when i can t bag and flashlight spam like the real pros
1;The game is very good with friends if you are looking for a game to grind out on this is it. Both modes (Killer and Survivor) are very fun and keep you playing the game. Certain perks can change how you can play this game. Overall one of my favorite games in a while definetly reccomend!
1;Game is amazing. Devs are constantly trying to make it fair new content about every 3 months. The game is fun when being played how it is supposed to be played. Survive With Friends groups that get on discord do tend to ruin the experience for the killer and salty killers ruin fun for survivors but most of the games you play won't be like that. If you don't dwell too hard on the bad games you'll have fun especially if you enjoy asymmetrical games.
1;A great party multiplayer game good gameplay mechanics. I like the idea it is something new and fresh. Really intense gameplay experience. The game is not polished like other aaa games but for the price under 20 euros it is a good choice to try this slasher movie'' game.
1;Product received for free. Orginally wrote a bad review of this game due to some horrible connection issues. However it has greatly improved since it's early days.No more connetion problems.This game is fun was strangers and fantastic with friends. With all the abilities and perks of this game it can be quite a fun challenge. Keep it up devs.
1;A game that provides a unique kind of thrill. Very fun with friends although SWF is broken and takes forever to play with friends. devs are very funny and friendly but dont do to fix the game. They act like they work hard to develop what we ask for as a community. They dont care about what we have to say and are ignoring bugs. Although it is very unclear how to win in this game at the start.
1;This game is tons of fun but it can take some time to get the hang of. Playing survivor is where it's at if you want the thrilling experience of being in a horror movie. However playing killer isn't quite as fun because of some cheap and annoying tactics taken by survivors. Hopefully the game will be balanced better in the future.
1;This game is still fun as it is being updated. The devs are completely revamping the pip system as well as balancing out the killer with the survivors with the new incoming patch. I went away from the game for a bit but came back because it still holds a small place in my heart. Many killers and many survivors with different gameplay and perks available.
1;If you like eating wood I mean pallets. This is definitely the game for you. Not only are you constantly eating wood it also never runs out! Every 5 ft in a chase you will have a giant wooden piece of s h i t called a pallet thrown right onto you! What's better than that? Oh! There is something better! The survivor can jab you in the a s s and force you to drop them! The good kind of cancer. &lt 3
1;I really enjoy this game a lot. It's one of my favorites and I would recommend it to anyone. The balancing between killers and survivors are a little biased with survivors having a tad too much power but it doesn't deter me from playing as both. Really fun but some survivors are very toxic so you have to be careful about that otherwise a really fun experience. I also own this on PS4 but the PC version hands down is the best.
1;this is a very good game would definetly recomend but if youhave a slower computer you can still play it. if you buy the game and have some lag you can go to the settings and change the quality or select the opitoin forit to run at what is best for your computer that helped me out a lot
1;Do you like being heart pounding terror? How about deadly hide and seek? What about chasing teenagers around with a machete and laughing as they slowly bleed to death on the meat hook you hung them on? If you said yes to any of these questions then this game is for you! At this stage of development the game is absolutely worth the asking price. When all of the new features and content that is on its way is implemented $20 will be an absolute steal for Dead by Daylight.
1;Product received for free. The game is very fun with friends and sometimes by yourself but it has some bad balancing issues with survivors being way to strong if their at least decent at the game but if you can overlook that its a great game definitely worth a try.
1;Welcome to matchmaking simulator! but seriously super fun game a riot to play with friends if only you could find a game! payed full price for this game and don't regret it But I do have more patience then some maybe take up knitting during those long lobby waits?
1;Hi! I really enjoy playing this game it is suuuper fun! But I don't think the traps under the hooks are that fair for survivors. Considering the new update that made it harder for survivors to survive. But otherwise the game is awesome. But why can't I get the new/old killers? Like michael myers and the hag. I would love to play them but I can't. Do you like have to play the game while you get the killers? Oh and the survivors.
1;Very fun game. New content often some paid but some free. However it can be buggy and I hear a lot of people say that the community is very toxic though I haven't run into much toxicity myself.Definitely a good game for you if you like interesting multiplayer experiences with or without friends.
1;Dead By Daylight is the abusive boyfriend who after abusing you tells you that it was just a one time thing and he didn't mean it. You being the naive child that you are believe him. Then a few weeks later Dead by Daylight abuses you again and tells you the same thing. You want the relationship to work so you continue even though he's abusive.Jokes aside I ing hate this game. But I love it so. 10/10 would recommend.
1;Been playing since October of 17' and I absolutely love this game! Sure there have been ups and downs with balancing but all in all a fun experience! This game will get my heart racing literally lol! ( I main survivor) The community can be toxic at times but not a deal breaker for me. Dont sweat it some people cant handle thier $h!t or get mad for losing. I also Love how the Devs are always updating and adding new content. Really enjoying the new open Beta now too! I highly reccomend!
1;"""Great game to play with friends. Always keeps you on your toes but there are times where the game can be so called """"toxic"""" when a killer is camping a hook and making it very difficult to play the game and have fun and I do know that is a strategy to play the game. I rate the game a 10/10"""
1;One of my best games to play. At anytime there is something to do i find. Either playing killer when you really need to take out some steam or just be pychopathic. Or playing Survivor with your friends and have fun looping the killer around a palet. They have been fixed now ( . And the other game mode is when you have friends and you want to just kill them like you most likely do normaly. Trust me Get the game its worth it.
1;great game not at all what i expected it to be but i'm still very very pleaased with what i got. Would recommend to anyone for ong nights of getting on by a killer that will relentlessly hunt you down while you cower in a corner or fix generators to attemp to escape either way you'll have a ton of fun in the process.
1;This game is amazing in my opinion with the addition of Survive With Friends I can play and have fun with my friends (even though it took a while) it has made me want to play the game and have more fun while doing so. I do have to say my favourite part of the game is playing survivor even though i do love killer. I completely reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good spook once in a while.
1;having this game since day one to now really shows the progress the devs have made with this game. I for one enjoy the game but at times it can be dull do to how others play not fitting your style or just not wanting to play the game at the moment that doesnt mean however that its not a good game I think if you play the game for a bit you can really enjoy it but not all the time because then it feels repetitve
1;Progression bugged by a blackhole in the bloodweb on my trapper.... blocking me from taking an important perk... And at level 14 so i can't get 2 perks on. (not the entity eating the bloodweb)Couldnt find any fix on the forumsBut the game is amazing. PLS message me if you know a fix ty
1;It IS A GREAT GAME. My only problem is that you can either play with only friends or no friends at all. Also as of June 20 2016 the game still has some bugs. Obviously you have to let them slide because the game is so knew.Some of the bugs i get are All the bugs i wrote down are now fixed. im editing this two weeks later
1;This game is a good game. The only thing thats get on my nerve is when you help somebody and then you get caught and they just run and don't help you like WTF and It takes a long time getting to a game so if you want to find a game make sure you have something to do waiting for it. But overall its good.
1;Would be more fun if people didnt DC and screw you out of your bloodpoints and your level ups. Thats my only main issue it. Even when they DC they dont lose anything i know i DC'd once out of rage but now knowing it messes up people who want to level up. Thats the only thing that needs to be fixed other than that its awesome
1;Dead by Daylight is a very fun game based around either playing as a Killer to chase down Survivors or the Survivors running away from the Killer and attempting to activate generator to escape and keep whatever items they find. The gameplay can sometimes be annoying but I always find myself coming back to the game even after it has frustrated me. It's a very fun and very new experience for some people. It's an amazing title and I recommend you give it a try.
1;Completely Stupid Game The Killers That Were Added Are Too OP you guys really dont know how to make a killer where players could actually enjoy their selves with the constant BS of how these OP killers you tend to create make these tricks to make a game seem almost impossible The Hillbilly The Trapper The Raith The Lullaby Leatherface should have stayed as the only killers in the game this game to me is by many parts dead.
1;Ok so my opinion is that the idea of this game is briliant but still there are a lot of problems that break the joy of the game there comes the facecamping killer latency camping. I know the devs are saying this is one of the ways to play this game but still this is the lamest way to play this game as a killer. As I said this game could be so good with a bit more dedication .
1;Before i had a negative experience with this game (mostly because of bugs) and stopped playing it for like 6 months or more.But then after that i wanted to give it another try just to see if the game has improved. And on my first game already i could tell that a lot of things have changed (for the better obviously). That's why i changed my mind and instead of keeping my negative review i made a new positive one.PS There are still somethings to fix but i'm sure that they will be.
1;Well This Is Also A Bug You Could Fix Too But This Game Is Highly Recommended For People With Good Manner and Capability Of Not Getting Irritated.Bug With the menu I go to my bloodweb (With My Mouse) only to figure everytime I go to click it the whole screen jolts When I use controller to move in the menu it doesn't. So for now I decide to call it Controller Compatible For Menu's.Other Than That Good Game.
1;"""Great game. Love the concept. Hours of fun. Only downside for me is the connection bugs that probably shoulda been knocked out in Beta. (for example trying to join a game as a survivor and getting """"failed to join game"""" again and again and again and again. Also the random disconnects where the game says """"connection to steam lost"""" and closes the game on you in the middle of a match.)"""
1;"""I love this game! Currently you can't queue up with your friends in the ranked mode alongside randoms but there's recently been an announcement of a """"survive with friends"""" mode. In the same announcement weekly patches were mentioned so other cons such as bugs will probably be fixed."""
1;http //www.youtube.com/watch?v auEnZDKV0jkAs of right now I've put about 20+ hours into the game. The issues I currently have with the game are being addressed by the Dev's. Overall I think the game is really good and hopefully will have a bright future amidst the darkness.
1;"""I love Dead by Daylight and especially playing with friends. It is a great game you really get into the game. It feels great when youre intensly in the game and are getting loser and closer to escape to only be thrown under the bus by youre """"teamates"""". Quite a few ways to play the game fun and intense gameplay nothing too broken compared to other games"""
1;I only bought it 2 days ago and I'm already addicted. Although playing as the killer against 4 coordinated teammates (premades who talk on discord) is a terrible experience the game feels perfect in every other aspect to me so far. The bloodweb's design is unique and interesting there is a wide variety of characters so you can never get bored and so on.. Great game really
1;it's a very fun game with interesting and original concepts and mechanics. The only downside to the game is the matchmaking process which can sometimes seem like they only have 1 server running in the middle of nowhere. Overall very fun game and for 20 dollars it's very worth it
1;Dead by Daylight is a great game! Great gameplay can be really stressful sometimes. Lot of different maps different killers and surivors. The leveling system is really great it makes you want to play again just to get those bloodpoints lol.Some killers should be nerfed in my opinion but if you have good teamates and yet still manage to lose against those killers (hello Freddy) then it just means that you are bad.
1;Seeming as the devs are intent on actually fixing the issues this game has namely high rank d/cers and window cheesing I would totally reccomend this game. Them adding party queueing and other quality of life improvements are just icing on the really spooky and brutal cake. The candles are hooks.10/10 would take people to the dungeon again
1;For the price point this game is incredible. Geniunely interesting and fun gameplay in a asymmetrical way. The Killer player feels powerful when you play as him. The survivors do feel helpless and there's that aspect of teamwork vs. selfishness do you want to survive or risk death saving a team mate for a few more points. It works on many levels which Evolve simply didn't.If even a little bit curious pick this up it'll surprise you just how great it is. At this price point its a steal.
1;good game but finding a match in survive with friends is really annoying cuz whenever no matches is found u have to all ready up again instead of having the search keep working. sometimes ur lucky and find a game quickly but most of the time u have to wait like 5 10 mins and ready up a ton of times before u find a match. i would be willing to wait if i could just tab out and do something else instead of having to stay in the game to ready up again.
1;By far one of the best games I've played and it's so new! The best thing about it is I have constantly been looking for a slight horror game that is also multiplayer so that I can play it with friends and this has given more than any other game I could find. Looks great plays great other than occassional lag which I think is because of the host of each lobby and I find fun on playing both survivor and killer (except when killers just stand there and stare at you as you die). Overall 10/10
1;This game has both good and bad elements. I find Dead by daylight is boring to play by yourself but extremely fun to play with friends. My friend and I played together for 5 hours straight before he had to go. I tried to play by myself themnext day and couldn't even finish a game.
1;Although this game has it's bugs and a few connection issues. This game is great. I have had a great time playing with friends. I play killer when I play by myself and it is loads of fun. If you are on the brink of deciding whether or not to get it just get the game. It is lots of fun.
1;a cancerous toxic warzone of pleasure x3 its an amazing game and i literally want stop playing it i would 10/10 recommend( for starters i know it might be difficult to understand some stuff but trust me the more u play and learn the more it gets intresting and fun ) &lt 3)
1;I made a review about this in 2016 back in the early days of the game and it has come a long way from what it used to be. The matchmaking no longer takes ages to find players. A lot of bugs have been fixed. Overall the experience is a hell of a lot smoother than in 2016.
1;Hey guys. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game.I played nearly 200 hours since it was released. My friend introduced me this game and I introduced to other friends and we're all having fun. i understand there are issues however the devs are listening to players and they're fixing bugs and im happy about that.this game has potential and i cant wait for more maps and new characters.
1;This game is awesome. Being able to survive with friends or kill your friends the game has an addictive leveling and ranking system with a mix of horror that makes it a game you can play for hours on end. I would reccomend that you buy it with friends however unless you are just looking to be a killer because surviving without friends can be boring but its a good way to get online friends.
1;I like and dislike this game its so much fun with friends and when you have a good team but when you have lag (game works on P2P killer is host) and play with new players who don't know what they are doing you just want to quit but I just love playing so yeah its a good game
1;I totally recommend this game started with a few bugs but nearly all were fixed last patch. A great survival game. This game is hugely growing up on players. So as i expected. 100% Should be bought. If you don't like survival type of games give this game a try and your idea will change instantly. Its just amazing. Have fun on the game if you don't like it give the game another chance and play it again. You will like it for sure.
1;The game is starting to be really pay 2 win... first Mike that oneshots almost everyone and now some swampy thingy... i know that devs got to make money on that but it could be less op... thats what im thinking now..When i dont look at that fact i wrote up and on some ingame bugs... its really cool game but as i said be4 its so much pay 2 win... even to me (Im Hearthstone player)..
1;Overall this game is one of the best deals going on steam. It is addictive entertaining and efficient. There have been some issues since the release however devs continue to improve and make it an improving experience.My only real complaint is the grinding required to get the good perks. Once you have them it is enjoyable every game against skill of the same level. If you like multiplayer horror experiences then I don't think there is anything better.
1;really fun game however when the hosts is always the killer there serious problems with this. Have a connection so that way at least 1 2 people disconnect(surviors). free win for killer. and no partying up with friends becasue there is no option. 2 big things that need fixing.
1;Pretty good game.Balancing is all over the place and tons of glitches the devs could fix if they weren't on vacation all the time.Full of adrenaline rushing parts when the killer is after you or if the survivors are on the verge of escape.Lots of diversity in the loadouts and many different killers to play as to mix it up.7.5/10 good game but needs some fixes
1;This game is so fun! I've never played anything even close to it before and for the money it's incredible. If you're between this and Friday the 13th you cn't really go wrong but this game offers a little more to work for. Plus as someone who prefers to play as the killer I appreciate the ability to solely play that way if I want. I recommend watching some streamers play it before you start grinding it'll help a ton. 10/10.
1;Come onnnnn you know this is a good game right? You as the developers know that this is great so please fix the servers and help me get INTO a game with a full 4 team...why can we get a game faster with 2 people then with 4...just get me a killer to kill me and my friends. please.
1;Absoloutley fantastic game the devs truly care about players input and try their very best to put out relevant and wanted updates/content.Any bugs are fixed quickly ) I've played this game more than any other game I've owned in 20 years.Which..says a lot.
1;Its a very good game but they really like to add op killers lately #NerfKrueger (they nerfed him already but he s still op) but game is a lot strategic and you really need to know some good tactics for both killer and survivor. Very good game overall. 8/10
1;More of a PSA then a review. It's just not fun for newbies unless you play with friends I think. There's not a fair matchmaking system in place currently. I'd have 5 15 hours on this game and I'd get matched up with survivors who had hundreds of hours on the game. Most games are like this. I couldn't take it anymore and I uninstalled. I definitely regret the purchase. P.S. the community is very toxic. It's nothing like what you see on streams.
1;I highly recommend this game including if you have friends to play with. It really makes you choose decisions. For example i was hiding in bushes from the killer but he got one of my friends who was on a hook. The exit opened and i was next to it so i had the choice to leave and win or to leave my friend for death. Its a really fun game and is well worth the money get it asap!
1;I like this game but it is buggy. It is fun to play as survivor but there is to many camping or killers and killers are boring after a while but you get the most points if you dont camp.Servers are hit or miss if your trying to play with friends you can forget about it.So i recommend this game but wait till all the bugs are fixed.
1;Dead By Daylight has it's ups and downs like any other game.The ups The game is fun you make a lot of new friends playing there's interesting contentThe downs A few glitches camping killers jerk killers tooMostly the ups out weigh the downs for me and I would reccoment this game.
1;Survivor its a wonderful time of the year everyone has lots of funKiller you mean they kill each otherSurvivor no no they are funKiller Killing people are fun I like killing peopleSurvivor and you give each other a presentKiller and when you opened them they explode Survivor no! they are nice giftsKiller nice doesn't like much fun to me
1;Awesome game but recently its been very hard to get into games. wether its taking 5 minutes or its saying i have no network connection. Killers face camp to much and playing killer is almost impossible without camping which is annoying for both parties.
1;Product received for free. This game is very good. for now is my fevorite game. .is fun but not so much scary like i was thinking. in the game most pepole help other pepole( .but there is only one problome. to much time to find a server... i was give the game 9/10 tanks for keep fix problom for as D &lt 3
1;"""Had me """"hooked"""" from day 1. I have been on the search for a survival game that grabs my interest and I think this one is lovely. Love all the characters and players. You run into a couple toxic people like any game but the good ones are still there and make it worth it after a game goes your way or not. Can't wait to see what come with this new build as the PTB was great."""
1;Great game I recommend playing the game with friends not alone. One bad thing about this game is its locked at 60FPS. I have a GPU Asus 970 Intel Core i7 7700k 4.2ghz and 16gb of ram and i have to play on low settings. If anyone can give me idea's on how to fix this. Pls lmk
1;Great game every game is different. You can to play as a team on survivor side or lose alone if you worked alone on the survivor side. Killer is fun for early game farming. Cons Takes almost forever to match make as survivor where playing as the killer takes like 20 seconds.Dev needs to look into enticing more rewards for the killers
1;The game is really fun I just started playing it.But the thing is waiting for a game takes way longer than actually playing a game.And I think every patch the game breaks even more.There would be infinite loading screens disconnections and constant crashes.It literally depends on luck whether you get into a game or not.Without these issues the game would have been my favourite game I ever played.But I think the idea of the game is very recommended if you like horror games
1;This game is awesome and can be very hard sometimes. The player base is very salty sometimes but.... it's ok sometimes when the killer bashes your head in the first minute in the match it's understandable ))It has some bugs here and there but the very annoying ones are gone now (at least this is how I see it).
1;Product received for free. Wont' t play it anymore until the loopholes of 'getting disconnected deliberately' is solved. These few days I couldn't find a match without deliberate disconnection just for not being downgrading ones level. The problem has to be fixed
1;i love this game but it crashes every day many times out of all my games this is the only one that crashes.i have a 4770 i7 cpu and a gtx 970 gpu and 8 gb of mem.its not a beast of a pc but its not garbage either.so please fix what evewr is wrong with the game
1;Two of us are left the trapper has hooked the other survivor and I know where the trap door is. Guilt overwhelms me and I go to save poor Dwight. Get him off the hook get hit teammate abandons me I get hooked and he camps the trap door.10/10 would be a martyr again.
1;If your thinking about buying this game... DO IT!!! Even thought there are things that need to be improved &amp fixed the devs are working hard &amp listening to the community to improve the game. I normally never review games because it's not worth repping them but this game is a ing blast! I Strongly recommend this game! You'll get great moments filled with action adrenaline and laughter!
1;Despite its faults it is still a fun game. Played as killer main when all your hooks would get sabo'd and infinites were a thing still managed to hold rank 1. Quit for quite a while because of the toxicity and the bugs. Came back and had way more fun when I stopped caring about ranks and being super competetive.
1;i ask myself why i keep coming back to this gamei ask myself why its fun to hold M1 for half a gamei ask myself why i play a game and complain about it a loti ask myself if nurse is truly broken and should be deletedi ask myself why i hate camping killers but proceed to loopthese will never be answeredbut the game is fun i guess
1;"""Worth a buy no doubt. Amazing balanced competetiv game with great community and devs doing there best to keep the game going. Sure there are bugs and unfriendly players but which comp game doesn't have them?! Devs doing there best to get rid of the bugs and the rewarding parts for those players.Game is getting better and better.""""Pretty good job so far"""""""
1;Product received for free. soooo good i just love killing my friends lolbut for real....i love this game it is so fun with 1or 4 frends and being the killer is fun as well. The only thing that is cheep thing in the game is when the killer is mike miers. You need spine chill tear 2 to stay alive when he is being use but i would give this game a 10/10 even if im playing with mike miers becouse it could be a good challangeover all the game should be a 11/10
1;Sorry guys ...... I am not playing this game again untill the Campers are gone !!! This is so anoying you got no chance too survive anymore becaus there are only freacking Campers and tunnlers !!! PLEASE END THIS DEV S PLEASE END ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS !!! 12.06.2018The Game survived the new patch is out evrything is good again finally !
1;Pros The idea of the game is good.Cons Many many bugs.EDIT 20 January 2017 you can't even join a lobby.EDIT2 28 January 2017 now you can join lobbies but every killer facecamps you.EDIT3 13 February 2017 best update ever game runs very smooth now good job devs.
1;This game made me poop myself the first time i played it... after that i just realized i wasnt actually playing the game but i looked at my mom. The game itself is a cat and mouse game which can be fun in the right company but it mostly sucks wanger tangs.
1;Aboslutely love Dead by Daylight! It's super easy to get addicted to this game and no matter how many times I play I still feel the tension and thrill that comes with it being a horror game. There's a lot of people playing this game and it's community is great for the most part and it just keeps growing. Nothing about this game isn't fun. Highly recommend.
1;Rewrote my old negative review considering the work the devs have started putting into fixing the games issues.The new player experience and balance in some areas is still pretty bad but overall the game is worth it now. You can get quite bit of game time out of it.
1;Is the game fun solo? Certainly.Is the game 2spooky4me? Probably not it loses its 'horror' after about 20 hours.Playing with friends? Hilarious fun and shenanigans.Is it worth $20? Without a doubt.Should I avoid the forums? If you value your sanity.Quite a steal at $20 and if you can get a friend to play it with you...you're in for a good ride with its ups and down. If you can get four others to play it with you then you're in for a crazy time.
1;I very much enjoy this game personally I would say this is the best game i've evr played I really love the artwork and the perspective these characters have it runs verry smooshly for me Yes i would recommend this game for any and all gemers and even the horror fans out there Good job to everyone taking a part in creating Dead By Daylight props to you guys )
1;One of my most favourite games i have on steam i love making the killer annoyed if i am survivor but the better feeling is making survivors angry because they all seem to think theyre above everyone for some reason they are easier to play and you are probably gunna have a lot more fun at first playing as survivor. put the time and effort into being a good killer though and it gives you 10x the joy. oh and welcome to one of the most toxic communities in steam ) have fun in the fog &lt 3
1;promotes graverobbingOkay but seriously This is one hellova game and you should buy it. Sure there are some bugs that need fixing and toxic players that either A have no respect or B Will bully you 'till you break. No seriously you really need to avoid some parts of this game's community. Those people involve s...LOTS OF THEM...
1;To be honest this game will make your life depressed if you decide to play killer you will want to suicide you would go to a shop and buy a rope then try to hang your self becuase of this game it's so balanced pallet loops infinite loops t baggers flashlights bugs gen rushing. As a surivvor i would recommend it to you if you are ing toxic that wants to make people suicide and annoy them. Killer 0/10Survivor 11/10btw devs FIX UR ING GAME.
1;Wonderful game beautiful concept. Like all types of games it could use some improvements. Personally I will get a few hundred hours in perhaps more. You never really know what you'll get from your team and/or killer allowing it create a great variety of possibilities.
1;Product received for free. It was pretty fun. I think it is more fun with friends that have your back though. The only problem I have is that sometimes when I try to exit the game it doesn't let me. Also the loading screen can last for 30 minutes without picking up a game but other than that the game is super fun!
1;With BHVR purchasing the rights to the game and the most recent iniative to balance the game I do have to say that they've done a very good job at fixing many of the issues for both sides. There is still a long way to go but right now the future is looking far brighter. For that I have to change my score.
1;Beware. It is dangerously addictive. I have uninstalled this game three times but I always come back. Expect constant balanced unbalance and toxicitiy among the higher ranks. There's plenty of low skill people in the high ranks because they camp and tunnel. Can be rewarding if you get good.
1;The game is kind of frustrating in its current state. But im still giving it a good review. Because all the recent negatives you will see are from peopel who are angry because the game is actually becoming balanced for once. The game is very fun and the devs are making steps in the right direction to a better game. Despite all the negative reviews you see just ignore them. They actuall ymean nothing. half of them have like only 100 hours or so. Give the game a try its very fun
1;I love this game its a great idea and most of the time is fun to play. But there is SO many laggy games which is almost impossible to survive on and i just get really mad when i loot a chest and its a toolbox but it ALSO happens to be on the most laggy server on earth and there is no chance of surviveing..... if the Dev's buys servers it will fix A LOT of people's problems with this game but other then that it is a really good game.
1;After a lot of bugfixing over the course of the last two years which was absolutely necessary it became a pretty fine game.With all the new features that got added (not only through DLCs) it also stayed interesting the whole time.Its a great game to play together with friends and its not too hardware hungry eighter.
1;A lot of simulators built into one game Waking Up Your Entire Neighborhood Simulator Screaming Simulator Sweat Simulator Game Bugs Simulator Toxic Simulator Disconnecting Simulator Lag/Lag Switch Simulator Leaving Your Teammates for Dead Simulator Ragequit Simulator Pallet Looping Simulator Flashlight Simulator Salt Simulator Focus/Tunneling Simulator Camping Simulator Body Block Simulator Reporting Simulator BM Simulator Crying Simulator Rage Simulator Skill Check Simulator
1;"""It's crazy fun but plagued by the people who play the game in a really """"unfun"""" way. There's campers """"infinite"""" abusers and others with just bad manners but the pure adrenaline that I get from this game outweighs the frustration with the other parts. You will run into the some crazy glitches every now and again but I would still recommend getting this game.The developers are very receptive to the community on reddit and the steam forums here which may be both a blessing and a curse."""
1;A very fun game pretty straight forward killers kill and survivors survive.There are a few players using cheap tactics like camping on hanging survivors but you can find fun games most times.There isn't a great deal of content to justify a 15 price tag but it is still an enjoyable game.
1;The game now is so worth buying as it is now so fun. The wait time is very short and i dont need to mock my location just to find a match anymore. Which makes it great as now its better than friday the 13th. I would suggest this to anyone who wants to play a game for a long time and enjoys horror.
1;This game is simple and easy to learn but offers great replayability. This is the 4v1 game done right. It has great atmosphere and will cause nightmares when played after dark. It still has a bunch of bugs but most of them seem to be due to connectivity issues. The Devs are very active and listen to the players. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
1;very fun i enjoy playing this alot can't wait till the fix killer dodgers and the que botton for survive with friends so i can acually play with my friends without haveing to spend 20 30 mins looking for a game has a few bugs but is really worth the money would recomend this game to people
1;"""Honestly the only hiccup in this game for me is not matchmaking with THE BEST teammates. Playing as survivor or killer I have to say this is an awesome experience. I didn't get the chance to play until the free weekend and let me say """"Instant Buy"""" After about an hour of gamaplay I knew I'd found something great. I don't have a solid friend's list and so matchmaking wasn't exactly to my liing but even so I have loced every second of gameplay."""
1;Love the game. Well developed much more balanced than others I have tried playing. You can have a game with all survivors losing or one where the survivors make a fool of the killer with sometimes an even game of one or two gone. The dlc that s been released has all been good. The team has done well to fix errors and continue trying to make a good game.
1;"""Great game. r8 8/8 m8Pre edit """"Doesn't support """"Co op Multiplayer""""/a lobby system for multiplayer / Otherwise Great game 20 hours of gametime laterI've spend just over 60% of my game time on this game trying to find my friend in online lobbies.. I would rate this game VERY highly because of it's great mechanics and awesome gameplay. But this lobby system is absolutely terrible(and that's without me even mentioning the """"Failed to join a game"""" crap that occurs every friken time..)."""""""
1;This game is really good sure it has some bugs in it but what games dosen't there are two types of people in the Dead By Daylight community there are the chill/cool ones and there are the ones with a high level of sodium chloride and feel like they should win every time if you ever meet these type of ppl and you will ignore them
1;EDIT Since patch 1.4.0 the lobby issues seem to be resolved so I can now recommend this game.This is a great game! One of the most addictive and enjoyable multiplayer games I've played in years. The music / audio is outstanding and the game still gives me chills at certain moments even after 150+ hours of gameplay.
1;This game has helped me put my life back on track.In the time spent waiting for my last game I Cleaned the house Got in touch with family Went to college Got a decent job Found a wife Had 2 kids Retired in Florida DiedOnly to have the guy I'm finally matched with Queue dodgeGreat game for procrastinators 11/10
1;Good game like very good but it need some fix at bugs and with the players that camp.But sometimes you will get angry and rage quit bcs tunnel and camp bcs i found a player that camped me with 2000 hrs but what i can you you decide how to play but please dev team fix the bugs the toxic players and stop adding dlc for nothing and ban good players
1;I love this game. It's great for streaming and great to play either with friends or solo. The only thing I would change would be to be able to deny someone from taking you down off the hook. Most randoms will take you down in front of the killer for points and it makes me livid. QUIT IT. Otherwise never had any issues with the game. Oh except when the game doesn't load and returns you to the main screen and it takes your offering anyway. Rude.
1;real good game. got to make it out alive or be the killer it's fun both ways but be careful some times when you go to save pepole you get put on the hook and the guy you save will not come for you. challenging both ways. starting the genorators is challenging i love the game hope you do to
1;I LOVE this game sure the devs have stuff to fix but doesnt EVERY dev team have stuff to fix? This game at it's base it incredibly challenging both as the killer and survivor and it's incredibly rewarding to win AND lose (barring the occasional facecamping killer or infinite abusing survivor both of which are being work on by the devs).This is one game that I can play a mtch over and over and over and still have fun for hours and days.
1;UPDATE 10/16/17Game is a lot smoother now and a lot of fun.______________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW Good and fun game but it's glitchy as F**K. Constantly disconnects me and my group of friends. Half of the time we give up because we can't get a game started.
1;Game is epic Every match is fun and interesting to play Early on u have to endure salty survivors and their jukes but u get used to it laterThe game would have been much better if they add features like viewing ur recent matches like replays hence 9/10
1;The game is a lot of fun. The devs are pretty cool too and are definitely committed to fixing issues as they come up. Admittedly it's feeling a bit grindy now after all the time I've put into it but you can't say I didn't get value for money! And with how addictive it is I'll be back in a few weeks for another hundred odd hours.
1;Yes it is a fun game BUT SINCE THE GAME RELEASED FINDING A LOBBY WITH 2 OR MORE PEOPLE TAKES 40 ABOVE TRIES TO FINALLY JOIN THE GAME??? YEH I DONT THINK I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS GAME WITH THE UP COMING DLCS IF THIS ISSUE DOESNT GET FIXED. ALSO SO MANY BUGS!
1;I've really enjoyed playing Dead By Daylight. Its really fun. There are problems with balance and the Meta perks are ridiculous for both survivor and killer. But every game feels different and plays different. I just choose not to use Meta perks and use just random perks to see what I can come up with. Its a really fun game. Give it a try when its on sale for sure.
1;Even if the last patch right before the free week end was a bad idea and added some annoying bugs they released 4 hotfix within the 48 hours of the patch to fix it.To talk about the game it's really funny especially with friends for a spooky night )Totally recommend it! (and the price is pretty correct for the amount of content and replayability)
1;Even with the bugs that come with the game and some (by personal opinion) current progession system tatics that need to be changed the game itself is fun very arcade like and should give you mutiple hours of enjoyment with or without the DLC purchaces.
1;"""Dead by Bugs is pretty fun ig. not a horror game like at all. its more funny than anything. definetly worth the $20 though being that you can play it for hours and not get tired of it. if you hack dont expect to ever get your account back since the devs are anal about that stuff. overall a fun game. the devs """"did a pretty good job"""" )"""
1;I definetly reccomend this game it's alot of fun to play eventhough there are also some toxic people in it but that's always in every game so you can't really avoid toxic people. Like i said though the game is very fun to play especially with friends.
1;I really love this game ! It has a great concept and it's very easy to get addicted too. If you can by pass small glitches then you should get this game. The only problem I have is some players are very toxic I often play with friends to avoid the toxicity. Other then those minor things it's a very fun and addicting game !
1;This has always been one of my favorites. I had it on the Xbox before I made the switch to PC. Got this game because a bunch of friends play it. I can legit sit here and play for hours on end. I highly recommend this game. Its fun engaging and always has me on my seat because its a little spooky. Especially when I go against The Hag.
1;This is a game that is continually supported by the developers. They truly listen to player feedback and attempt to constantly improve the overall experience. Is every change spot on every time? No. However not every player will be satisfied with every single addition or tweak to the game. New characters and content are always being added and it is the one game that I have kept coming back to after so long.
1;Decent game. Long grind. They are finally balancing out the game and everyone is throwing a fit. I might start playing a game if they do a full balance (including DS and Selfcare). Let's just hope the devs keep going in this direction and don't pull another Freddy.
1;I personally really like the game. Many bugs fixed since I have started playing in December. Need to fix the survive with friend s lobby. Concept is incredible and they keep balancing killers/survivors. Some salty game play but good players figure out how to counter. I bought this game for 4 other ppl and we all enjoy it.
1;This is a great and fun game and my favorite thing is being the survivor with the intense music going on while running for your life!!! If you want even more fun buy the DLC's you get new killers and survivors but overall this is a really amazing game
1;Pros It's a really fun game. It allows you to search games with your friends now (Thank god) They certainly do not matchmake you with a rank 1 when all of you are rank 20 (I suppose?) Cons The matchmaking still takes quite long especially when you're a full party of 4 people searching the game (I hope the devs fix this issue soon!) The server is really laggy sometimes (So until then I suppose it's a Natural for me /
1;Product received for free. This game is being plagued by campers. 9 times outta 10 when you get hooked the killer just stands there or runs around the hook taking the fun out of it by not giving the players a chance to really do anything. something needs to be done about it cause its a great game that shouldnt be ruined by unfair players.
1;I played this game in early release for around 80 hours but got too frustrated with the bugs. I picked it up again about two weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised to find queueing for survive with friends and in game bugs had been mostly fixed (at least the really glaring ones). I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes horror/survival games and doing it with friends.
1;Not a perfect game by any means. But it is one that has routinely gotten better as time has gone on and one that I always come back to.The developers have made some notable errors *cough* Freddy nerf *cough* but do seem to eventually figure out what to do if this most recent patch is any proof.Great game to play with friends great game for sacrificing Dwights to the entity.8/10
1;Currently the best Asymmetric Horror game. It still has issues relating to balance but the good news is that the devs are listening and are finally starting to right the ship The community is very divided. A lot of toxicity mostly from Survivor mains. But if you can get past rage messages in post game chat rage invites and in game tea bagging then it can be a very fun game.
1;DbD is my fovorite game on steam. that is that. I have 135 hrs on the game and i love it! the game does have things that r always ed about like jungle gyms camping and infinates but will the community really fully love any game? Dbd is amazing and the fact that the devs r working on the game to make it even better is awesome! keep doing what u do and make the game as balanced as possible! #MAKEWRAITHGREATAGAIN!
1;"""You don t like people? You wanna chase em down in Hill s have eyes Chainsaw massacre Resident Evil style? Or maybe you want to show your surviving skills?Then this game is right up your way!Flawed? Yes maybe a little with lobby waiting and no """"proper"""" matchmaking but still the gameplay makes up for it more then well if you like feeling your blood and heart throb through your chest and veins...Unless your getting hooked then it s pouring down your body..."""
1;Very fun game and a high skill ceiling. Even better with friends and just a great game all around. Do some research before you play and find a killer you would love to play or a survivor with the best starting perks you like. That's when you realize how fun this game is and learn all the charcters by the end. Fantastic game.
1;becouse its a good game and so many panic and thats so funny when you play with friends not just when you play with friends all time as a survivor as a killer is nice when you play with friends and you see your friend and hit him se says like AAAAAAA!!! and its funny but its not funny the campers
1;This game is great very fun to play. The sad thing is that there are tons of bug and for some reason the devs don't focus on the important stuff like the networking. It's very disturbing that they added a DLC character which I will not buy untill they fix the game.
1;I originally gave this game a bad review but after a few patches i realized the amount of work that the devs put in to satisfy the community and i'm happy to say i'll by playing and supporting the game thanks to the devs great work of course there are still things in the game that i wish were in the game and other things that i wish were not but the devs are definitely dedicated to well being of the game and i can respect that.
1;Excellent game very intense and the procedural generation makes the game feel new enough and different that it doesn't get stale fast. As the devs add more maps killers and survivors the game will only get better.Of course at the moment there are some bugs but in my opinion the good far outweighs the bad here. Game well worth the full price of $20.
1;i don't really have a recomadation for this game because it has broken mechanics and just buggy bad community which is also ruining the game and etc but it is super fun and very orignal have about 300+hours and sometimes it is funny i recomand it but if you can't deal with salt and stuff bugs and mechanics i wouldn't get it
1;Product received for free. So im still kinda new 20hrs or so but its a very fun game much more than I originally thought it would be. Suvivor aspect is by far my favorite but the killer side gives a neat switch up of the game I'd definately recommend to anyone who like campy horror movies or thriller survival games
1;Firstly I want to say that this is an amazing game. I have over 600 hours and It's something that I come back to day after day. I can't seem to get enough of it lmao. The game has it's obvious flaws with bugs hackers lobby issues but the gameplay is there. If you can over come those flaws then you'll love the game. I whole hearted believe this game has amazing potential with all its new content and community. Keep up the amazing game DBD! 10/10
1;As survivor Run for your life simulatorAs killer rage at survivors in end game chat Pros Kill your friendsCons really ing frustratingOverall actually a really fun game. Can be annoying as hell some of the time but generally a lot of fun. Takes time to learn how to track survivors around the map and to hide from the killer. Not an easy game to pick up right away.
1;"""Product received for free. Dead by Daylight is a very tactical game that great to play with friends or solo. It makes you take decision that would make for a wining end or a horrible dead. The question you should ask your self ones you start is """" Are you willing to risk your self for the sake of another surviver?"""" You will feel the pain of every decision you make..."""
1;"""Survivor is overpowered and they have become cocky arrogant and entitled because of it. If you go into this and do well as a killer or do 1 underhanded tactice while they do several you WILL get comments and you WILL be """"called out"""" on it. Its really funny watching survivors cry about you being better than them though. Fun game to get salty comments from survivors but really frustrating when they are obnoxious."""
1;Great game IDEA and POTENTIAL.I really think the dev's should have kept it under lock and key for at least another month (kept it in EA) before releasing it due to the unfinished feel of the game.However in saying this if you enter a game where you have 4 competent survivors and a very competent killer the game can be very entertaining and really makes your heart race.
1;the games amazing it runs great. it looks great and what ever i play as i have fun but its unfair when you use an offering and the killer disconnects so i lose it right at the start of the game. and theres also no were to report if you suspect someone of cheating other then that the games amazing.
1;I would recommend this game. Its fun playing alone or with friends. What I dislike about is the queue system and the killer being as a host. The killer gives so much lag to the survivors and its very annoying and makes you want to quit. Theres also lot of bugs needs to be fixed but still its worth buying it.
1;This is my favorite game at the moment. This game is just one of the best multiplayer horror games out there. The fanbase is a bit split on this opinion but i have to say its better than friday the 13th. Sure there are lots of bugs but those just make them better (at certain times). And there are licensed killers so if youre a fan of horror movies then this is a game for you.
1;So Dead By Daylight. Is fun really like the concept but has a lot of issues. New players really don't notice it just happy to play the game. Put a good amount of hours into it and one starts to see that killers are kinda underpowered. Still a lot of fun.
1;This game gives me arthritis when i have to spam click so i dont die when i am hooked. This game also has scum killers that hunt you down when you are hit once like i have there mothers nudes on my phone and about to post it. This game also has kids that have nothing better to do so they play killer and then leave the game instantly making me derank
1;i mean its ok its fun at some games but it gets unfair and salty and just just no.but i mean play it with friends and its pretty fun and SOME online games are also fun but one side (killer or survivors) will be unfair unless its one of THOSE games which i mean idk.
1;Pros +Many waifus (Fen Ming Nea the Huntress.... the Nurse...)+Really fun game+You feel the adrenaline when the hook is near you and there's a Myers in Evil Within 1 in the match+Nice gameplayCons +Pay to win (as killer)+Lots of campers+Myers is op (same as first point)Extra notes +Fen Ming is asian+Claudette is invisible+Dwight is always in the locker+Myers Freddy Bubba The Doctor and the Wraith are OP+Laurie es T H I C C+Ranks are reseted every 13thRecommended? yes... oh yeah
1;I had a problem with losing lots of game progress and it took awhile to get it fixed but the moderators did reconcile the problem after a few months. I still feel it is a little long for a fix but this is a great game and one of my favorite games in recent times.
1;It is very good game but it needs a chat to communicate with the survivors for example to tell them to go to repair the generators that I am in charge of saving survivors. Or something like that.I think that is the only thing that the game needs as it receives updates survivors and new murderers etc
1;All of my games have seemed fair in this generator simulator 3.0. When playing with my friends this game is especially fun but could end up monotonous with long runs of playing. However the killers usually make such a difference in a lot of games that it makes it different and enjoyable to play.
1;Ok I think its high time I gave this a thumbs up. The dev team has really stayed on top of updates and major bug fixes. the game play is fun the concept is cool. some of the major bugs were killing me but I have had a long period of just fun play. I recommend this game
1;Please do not read any reviews after 7/14/18. These reviews tend to be from salty baby survivors who doesn't know what asymetrical balance means. Dead By Daylight is an awesome game that can be tremendously fun but sometimes stressful. However DBD has been getting better with each update since 2018. The game will be played the way it should be played.
1;Sometimes it will make you sad sometimes it will make you mad. But sometimes you will flashlight save and tea bag the killer at the exit gates and everything is amazing and you thank all the gods you were born. Killers who respect the kobe or give you the hatch i will always love you!! I will never get tired of this game even with all it's t and wannabe Toxic children.
1;A great and fun game but PLEASE do not call every Killer a Camper if you don't know what you are talking about. If he is a Camper it will be the easiest round you have ever played. If you have lost then he eather is not a camper or you are really bad. The only way to lose against a camper is going afk because you could escape before the first guy is dead.
1;Game is great just needs some things fixed. Devs are working to make updates that help the game grow but they tend to ignore some of it's bigger flaws such as infinite abuse DDOS attempts and bugs that have been around since day 1. Overall a fun game.
1;If you like to have your heart race every time you play this is the game for you.Very intense gameplay innovative leveling up system amazing lore. The survivors are charming and the killers captivating. Great atmosphere and music.I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS GAME! Definitely worth your money.
1;Product received for free. This game is really nice to play with friends but randoms still are good. This game pretended to be one of the best horror multiplayer games on steam. Community is good but you can find there campers and tunnelers ( Trying to kill one survivor and don't let him survive).
1;One of the most horrifying and extreme games I've ever played. All of the maps has their own difficulties and different game style and the graphic quality is amazing. I must admit that the game is hard to play but maybe the secret formula that made this game amazing was that. I highly reccomend playing online with your friends.
1;I love this game because I can kill people without regret. &gt ) JK dont call the copsBut its great fun playing as survivour too. Though if theres a camping killer just be super nice to fellow survivors try and save them as a group though you might lose its much more fun to try than to leave your team for dead.Overall I reccomend this fabulous game. And Happy Killing(Or surviving) I suppose )
1;Within the genre there is not many other games at the level of this one. Has already some time and with that some bugs are fixed and a lot of content is available (free DLCs or paid DLCs). As the price goes I think it is an okay purchase for a good time before it gets repetitive.
1;"""Enjoyable game with suspense and some skill in a tidy mix.First time playing got me real jumpy and some adrenaline.The down side is that after """"x"""" amount of hours you will not have the same jumpy and scared sensation if you do they will be rare.A really good game for anyone who likes to grind it out.The serious upside is that the games are never the same and can always suprise and test your skills."""
1;IS A REALLY GOOD GAME TO PLAY ONLINE SOLO OR WITH FRIENDS AND HEAR THEM SCREAM LIKE LITTLE GIRLS O A MUST OWN EVEN AT FULL PRICE. UPDATE 10/25/16 GAME IS OFFICIALLY BAD AZZ I KNOW THAT HALLOWEEN DLC YOU HAVE TO PAY BUT IS WORTH IT AND LOOK AT IT THIS WAY YOUR SUPPORTING A GOOD GAME FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. THANKS FOR ALL THE HARD WORK DEVELOPERS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. Amazing )
1;honestly i love this game. i have about 100 hours on ps4 as well and i still come back to this game when im ready to chill out or grind a game for a night. its alot of fun with friends but you can still have fun if you are a solo as well. 10/10 would be a toxic meg again &lt 3
1;The game makes so much fun but is still buggy. The developers are working and communicating very much which is so good about the game. They listen and consider the opinions of the community. In the beginning you will have a easier time as killer than survivor. You can even play with your friends which is great. Superb game making so much fun. Try it out!
1;One of the best game i ve been playing.It is a great game where you choose to play as a survivor or a killer. As a survivor you need to team up with the other three survivors and fix five generators and then escape and even be careful so the killer doesn t attack you and hang you on the hook.As a killer you basically just obstruct the survivors from fixing the generators and escape.The graphics is good and even well optimized.
1;It is an awesome game. I am very enthusiastic to see the new content that is upcoming. I have seen a few bugs form time to time some of them good for me others bad for me and others that were just hilarious. The game is still fresh so the are quite some errors here and there but the developers are doing their best to patch them (at least I think so). And over all is really funny to play it with friends especially when you are the killer and they are your prey.
1;I find this game can be really fun depending on if you have friends to join you. Steam sould make a deal where you can buy multiple copies for cheaer and then gift them to friends so it makes you wanna buy the game. Also killers that camp can ruin the fun for this game.
1;Product received for free. I've decided after a couple of years to give more credit to this game.Community still sucks bugs are still plenty and balancing issues still exist...I don't think that will ever change however it is improving.I still play it so have to recommend.
1;Great game although many bugs. It's currently almost unplayable. It will run smooth for an hour then constant disconnects. I'll wipe a team and then disconnections lose points and can't even finish a round. It's not worth playing. Hopefully they fix the several bug issues in the future.
1;"""Do you like salt? Do you like it when a dev says they have """"done a pretty good job so far"""" while they clearly have not?Do you like asymetrical PVP where both sides can only truly win through scummy tactics at high ranks?Welcome to DbD do not enjoy your stay."""
1;Very good spook3 game and it is very fun to play with friends. I thouroghly enjoy the perk system as well as the leveling. Fun to play as killer or survivor both are incredibly interesting and have aspects that make them both worth the while. All in all gud gaem.
1;Really fun game because it requires teamwork to escape. Killer on the other hand feels almost left out when it comes to hooking the survivors. Even with the addition of Myers it makes you look around more instead of just listening for the heartbeat. Either way i would say 4 out of 5 stars.
1;Product received for free. Optimisation score 7/10.My specs Amd Ryzen 1600x 3.6ghz 16gb ram GTX 1050ti 3gb vram.Running on Ultra 100% resolution scale at 45 60fps (depends on map).I think developers made pretty good job so far.On my other computer(Amd A4 5300 8GB ram R7 360 2gb vram) on low textures 100% i get 20 35.Big thanks to devs for makeing this game!!!+ I cant complain i got game on giveaway PP
1;If you want a lobby simulator buy this game! It comes with the best lobby features! like spooky music that doesnt change! Or maybe the barely changing idle animation of your survivor! Or maybe just maybe you could get the loading game screen then you get sent to the title screen! Wow! Quality gameplay!
1;I love this game but by banning people out I think that a no only the hacker one should be ban!still see a lots of hacker around but hell yeah.. Play it ... THIS GAME IS FUN! camping is fine but it's not funif you are the killer that never find the sur you know it FUN if you doesn't get mad by hooking dying or couldn't find a sur
1;Soooo it's late at night and you know you have stuff to do tomorrow and you are on this game. You won't want to stop it's just too good. You'll always tell yourself one more game. It's only 5 minutes one more game. Time will slip away when you play this game but at least you'll enjoy every minute of it!
1;Very fun game when you first get it the fear and adrenaline was and still is one of my favorite parts of the game. I've had Dead by Daylight for a while now and though those factors have worn off over time and i play it as a competitive game now there are still be some killers that terrify me more than ever. But other than that get ready for a nice heaping spoon of salt as you progress up into the higher ranks.
1;I used to hate this game but after several months the devs managed to fix a lot of bugs and they made the interface quite well the only problem is the stupid behaviour of camping killers wich is the most annoying problem in the game since the release but hey that problem should be fixed by the ones who play themConclusion Good game but could be very frustrating some times
1;A game where you can have toxic kids and toxic adults come together into a community. Ranging from getting camped insta flashlighted moried and roasted in the endgame chat. Great to play with friends yet ironically hard to play killer against a group of friends. I love the game I may have periods of time where it makes me wanna kms but its a great game. 10/10 would play Toxic by Daylight again.Ps Nea is the true monster in the game. (I mean look at her abnormal face and hip size) monkaS monkaS
1;I like this game because of its thrilling experience as a survivor who is trying to escape a killer and playing as the crazed murderer yourself. There are a few bugs here and there but are pretty common from what I can see. Great game to play with friends or by yourself.
1;The learning curve is high. The grind for usable perks just to be competative sucks but the game is fun at its core. The game does suffer from peoples play style and how trolly they can be. You'll start to enjoy it more once you forget about rank and winning every match.
1;In its current state probably a 3 1/2 out of 5. The game itself is very enjoyable the problem is with the servers and menus. finding a game takes forever and then if anyone drops out while the match is loading you may as well call it a night 'cause its going to take all day to load. The menus are a bit glitchy and will ocationally freeze requiring a full PC restart to fix.
1;This game is pretty fun and has a really cool premise. However there are multiple things that make it unoptimized. For starters if you're brand new you may still go up against either a Killer or Survivors that should be &lt 10 in level. The 'season refreshes' make this even worse a lot of the times. Once things are done to make sense like changing unhook/disarm from the same button this game could be great. Until then it's fun to play in a group so you can all be frustrated together.
1;Let us see what's happening in this game. At the start it was great fun to play especially with friends. Enthusiasm has died out a little bit...or a lot. If I give just my personal uneducated opinion it'd be something like it's a nice game with some annoying bugs and lags but still worth the purchase if you have a couple of buds or nubs to play with.Killers are OP! Survivors are OP! The hatch is OP! Buy the game I guess.
1;I highly recommend this game since it's multiplayer it has infinite replayability. However they devs do need to recognise that their game is slightly buggy in the case that you can get hit through a pallet. Otherwise you should go pick this game up ).
1;Honstley i really enjoy this game its quite fun. I like it cause its diffrent and really no other game like this out there... It would be cool if they would add more modes such as maybe 2 killers vs 8 survivors and the survivors have to get gas to drive out of dawn to escape! Great idea i love it so far!
1;Aside the bugs/Glitches that occur this game is really fun if you have some friends Although it is annoying when the killer camps you when youre hooked. I reccomend buying this game on sale probably. But if youre sceptical and really HATE bugs then just dont bother with this.
1;Ok First things first First Game my heart has POUNDING Last one alive Got all Generators getting chased got down wiggled out (My heart was pounding even more) Got away and found a trap door in the distance Ran to it and escapedI WAS SO HAPPYFor the little time I played it was fun as hell I recommend it with people with a horror feel.
1;The game is mostly awesome but it has some major flaws. The worst flaw would be the matchmakeing. I played 2 hours already and more than 30 min I spent searching for a lobby. Another flaw would be the fact that you have no option for disableing VSync. The game runs well on my crap pc around 30 40 fps with some exceptions.Tho when you finally get into a game it is very fun. Also the price is good. I got what I payed for. (not like no man's sky)
1;Back to a thumbs up. Game entry much improved.This game is broken. Can't get into a multiplayer games but for rare instances. Sick of the bugs. I really want it to work well because it's fun to survive with friends...and murder them. Get it together guys.
1;I was a year since I played last the game was unbalanced and buggy however after going back there are very few exploits compared to before and balancing is not an issue for the most part they have added many things and fixed many things since then so this is very much a game worth getting.
1;I changed my review. I originally gave a negative review when Freddie was released. Now that he has been out awhile less people are playing him. I still believe he is overpowered but with less people playing him the game is much better. I have bought more than one friend a copy of this game. I play it all the time and have a crap load of fun.
1;This game is good fun when you play with your friends! Buy it and experience it for yourself. It's only 20 for loads of fun. Pro's Game support &gt Developer is community invested Playing with friends &gt Loads of fun! Graphics &gt Running very well on mid range GPU's Low price for what you getCon's Killers that don't know how to play can ruin a game Peer to peer
1;This game is very very amazing well made. And for the peoples that got lag or say that its not optimised go on your task manager and the search for the game in it right click on the process and the change priority and choose high priority i gain 50 fps by doing that well i went to 25 30 fps to constant 59 61!!
1;Good game but they should do more not just turn on generaters than escape they should add more costumes maps and most importantly more modes if you like a game that a killer is hunting you down while you and your friends have to turn on generaters then escape than this is a game for you i'll give it a 6/10 it's very fun but they need to add more
1;Incredibly fun game.Like seriously this game is a very good alternative to the exhausting FPS/MOBA/MMORPG masses that dominate the gaming industry.You can either tryhard as Killer or SWF to chill out a little bit without having to worry about match history hardcore ranked system and all that stuff I REALLY recommend this to anyone willing to try out new things.
1;A really good game sometimes it is very hard but I enjoy the game overall. An average games will take you 15 20 minutes. Fast leveling with the bloodweb system and daily rituals to receive extra points makes the game enjoyable for me. It is fun to play solo and with friends. 10/10
1;PIPU TU BUNDA.Dwight/10 The dev's try to balance the game but with all the bots lack of dedicated servers with no possibility to check your ping DC's constant by killers and survivors because matches are hosted by the killer himself the lack of a sense to have rank in the game (this is the only game that rank it's worth nothing) and the constant nerfs of the survivors you can only have fun with friends and laugh with them of the great variety of bugs.Sorry for my bad english I'm BR.
1;It is a fun game that I think people has split opinions on. I think the game is fun and even better with friends. This game puts you in a rush situation that gives you the sense of urgency to leave as quick as possible. Combining that with 3 other people is what makes a large amount of the game teamwork. I think it is good and fun to play especially if you like killer type games.
1;This is a fantastic game!... when it works!... March 2017 I have hardly been able to play this game with my friend (survive with friends mode) as we can NEVER find a game..... just a constant que! however when i que on my own I get a game... please fix this! otherwise you will loose a lot of players
1;"""TEN BUCKS OMG grab this game! You can play forever and not even have played a killer or even the other way around. Dont get involved with the salty 9 year olds you win some you loose some and both killers and survivors are OP. At first I hated this game cause it was challenging. After a month I loved to see how far I got """"oh $hit now I can do generators.."""" For a casual time killer piece that you can jump into on your PUBG breaks or Fortnite breaks. This is my solitare for my PC"""
1;I like this game a lot I just wish their was game chat in DBD. It would be pretty easy to do. Just do it like PUBG where depending on where your character is the mic can be heard from. And also the killer could hear what we are saying just like Friday the 13th.
1;"""I enjoyed this game. It's procedurally generated levels keeps it from becoming a """"Memorize the map"""" situation. Although there are more than a few players who care more about rank and don't make things fun the number of casual players just having a good time seems larger. Many of the bugs that plagued it's earlier releases seem to be under control. I would recommend this game."""
1;It's the asymmetric multiplayer experience of the got dang century. It's a game where it's fun to play as both the killer and the survivors the advancement/tech tree is unique and engaging and the meta is rich and ever changing. And it's actually scary! Crouching behind a box as the killer walks RIGHT PAST YOU is legitimately frightening and pulse pounding. I can't believe what they've done with this game it just keeps improving.
1;Product received for free. I like this game. Scary atmosphere exciting music when chased and cooperative style. But as a survivor I want the killer to run slower. It's like when the killer sees you the killer has about 70% to chase you down. Try to make a control that can dodge several killer attacks.
1;"""An extremely fun game if you happen to have 5 people around for a private match. Especially if everyone is on the same voice comms.Try to play single or """"Survive with friends"""" online and you get a long long line of...'NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND''NO MATCHES FOUND'"""
1;This game has so much potential. It is a great game that with a few outstanding issues that the developers have been working to address since the release of the title. The real selling point for me is that the developers are present and seem to care about improving this title.
1;Dead by Daylight may not be the most balanced game and sometimes the fun ends really early in the match but surely it has some intense moments for both killers and survivors. For me those moments make this game worth everything.It gets even better playing it with friends so much fun.9.1/11
1;Dead by Daylight is a super fun game where you can team with others (or friends) to survive. Or if your more of the bloddthirsty type you can kill all other survivors in the hopes they don't power the generators and escape. I hope the team will keep making this game as awsome as it can be!
1;It's challenging and really fun at the same time. This is the best game out of all the other games. There are perks and add ones for free so that's basically all you have to pay for is the game. If you are An F2P then you better start saving right now. When you get it have fun.
1;The game is still afflicted by inconsistent matchmaking with friends it takes way too long to connect to a killer to play but the game is an undeniably interesting asymmetric multiplayer experience. There's been a consistent stream of updates with more survivors and killers every few months. I only wish the game had a bit more polish to it. Facial animations look stiff and the hook always connects badly with the hook but it's a fun experience made even better with friends.
1;The game is exactly what I'd hoped it would be and more. Exhilirating fun as the killer and (sometimes) terrifying survival goodness from the survivors. That alone has me pleased but the customization of characters/the leveling system is fun and adds some depth and longevity to the game. It's been a bit sinc ei last played but as of then my biggest critiques would be the bugs that occur and the crazy amounts of animosity between killers and survivors that you can see post game.
1;ive played the weekend madness and my license just suspended for the game. But i like this game i wish there was a way to talk to your teammates in game but you cant nor type at all in game. whitch makes the killer more OP cause there is no comunication lol. But other than that the game is pretty good and fun. But the killer sould be slowed down a bit once he is on your your usually dead.
1;Lets get straight to what this game has taught me and did to me Pros (Goods)*I met a girl that I curently am having a realation ship with*New Update balanced it so much and well*People are Friendly*The fact that people try to rescue others is a sign of good*DLCs are not too expensiveCons (Bads)*People troll alot when they see a bloody party streamer (They Leave)*Not too many maps (Just my idea)
1;The game has gotten alot better since my last reviewTry the game out its good game but understand that the game is more about hiding and you will mostly die alot until you get used to the gameRanks reset on the 13th so around that time you may get paired with people above your skill level
1;Very good game i love it i doesnt have the best matchmaking but for a coop multiplayer horror game its simply the best if youre thinking between h1z1 and dead by daylight i would recommend this but as i was saying the matchmaking isnt best but i love it )
1;Product received for free. Welp scaryyyy at night D My gf's review This game makes me dizzy they should have a stabliser. Also the character are not very asthetically pleasing. Otherwise not bad... make my boyfriend scared and pee his pants. Funny to watch but not funny to clean....
1;This game is such a great idea but there is alot of mechanics that need to be fix like how the killer can strike you as you vault over walls. The matchmaking is also broken times you will be paired w/ a high level killer or a bot. There is a lot to be fixed but the idea of the game is great.
1;This could be a really great game to play with friends but they need to fix the survive with friends feature. The Lobby is really bad where you will have to keep constantly presing ready and searching and ready and searching for people because it keeps saying no matches found. This could go on for a long time and gets tedious. Wish I could play with my friends but its a mood killer dealing with this.
1;This game is super addicting and very fun. Yes it has it's flaws and bugs but still I can't stop playing it. I'm even running it on lower than recommended specs and it's still enjoyable. I like to think the devs are trying to fix what they can and I think it's slightly improved since it's release. I would enjoy it better on a more powerful computer. I recommend it if you're into horror games.
1;While the game has been through some rough patches and was probably rushed to release as a fully finished title this game is a lot of fun.It can be frustrating at time for sure but once you get the hang of the game mechanics and learn the fine details it becomes super addicting to play.Looking forward to more improvements to come (and hoping for no more major screw ups!)
1;I wasn't so sure about this game at first but eversince I bought it and played it with friends it was suprisingly fun. A bit addictive somewaht nervewracking and ridiculous glithces that'll loose your stiffness. One of the things that're concerning right now are the lost of rewards items launch errors or getting kicked out from the server etc. Please do look into it. Anyway overall 8/10.
1;It is a very additicing game and I still play it....I CAN'T STOP. Beware though it has a lot of minor bugs and is quite laggy if the killer is from a different region. It takes some skill so all the justin beliebers out there DON'T play this. Also #Dwightlivematter
1;Good idea medicore execution. Worth buying this game is alread fun and will be amazing once (if?) things are polished/rebalanced. If you're having trouble with the game crashing/freezing mid game try underclocking your graphics card by around 40 50 mhz and decreasing the power limit to 95%
1;First of all great game i love it. But all of my teams for the past 25 games i have played no one helped unhook. 10 of those games the killer camped because he doesn't know how to play the game. Just now the last round I played the killer had some sort of walls because he knew exactly where everyone was 1000% of the time. Also I played a few games where i distracted the killer so someone could unhook the guy and then no one came to unhook me.
1;I generally hate playing anxiety provoking games but this is one of the few that I consistently play at least every other day in my free time especially when I need to wake up before doing some studying. $20 is very reasonable. Great buy and would puchase as gifts for others.
1;this game is amazing or it would be if i could get more then a half of my games to load in. and when in a match playing without myself or a team mate d/c. as the the killer few that dont d/c before the match start i win most of the time because my pray are stuck or d/c before i get to kill them
1;Bought the game on Steam Summersale 2017 and it was WORTH IT !!The game's easy to understand but hard to master.Perks and items combination now this is the type of survival co op game i've been looking for all these time DThis game is very addictive 10/10 AWSUMM
1;I cant play it i have windows 7 i have a gtx 4000 video card and my drivers are all updated i really hope i can play this game again i love this game it is well worth my 20$ but i cant play it i need help plz.Anyone who has any tips or if one of the game desingers can help me plz write or comment back.
1;Great Horror Game. Very original concept and opened the door to a new brand of Horror games.People will be in constant flame battles about survivors or killers being OP but for an Asymmetric horror the balance is good. The game takes time to learn in the beginning but soon you'll be a pro.
1;When I just bought this game I thought that it was not worth your money but then I realized that this game is addicting and there are many interesting things in it. I do not jelly that I gave money for such an excellent game! I advise everyone to buy it.
1;Dead By Daylight is the funnest game Ive played in a long time. There is so much strategy as a survivor and even when your the killer. Every perk has a counter to it. Every person plays a role in the game especially when your playing with your friends. I highly recommend this game to anyone especially with the Free to Play Weekend coming up.
1;Really fun to play but matchmaking is terrible takes forever to find a game if one can be found at all this is really an issue that needs to be fixed could possibly be fixed by allowing matchmaking to happen between multiple countires instead of within induvidual countries that way matchmaking would be much faster (though this may create extra lag).
1;Death is not an escape but alt + F4 is.On a more serious note some bugs to fix and some balance issues but it's still playable (enough to enjoy it) have fun while playing it (don't take it too seriously...)I'd say with the bugs it's worth about 15$ so you should wait for it to be on sale before buying it.
1;This game has been getting better throughout the last year since the launch. Much better matchmaking result. Frequent game patches released by devs. Game mechanisms revisited and improved. Easier characters progress due to better reward from daily rituals. New DLC contents are quite balanced regarding gameplay. Community keeps growing and has been less salty. Killers seldom camp their victims now.I have stopped playing this game for several months and now I am back again.Rating 9/10.
1;I love this game to death. IT is really fun to play once you get to know it and never gets old on a long term level. It is scary the first couple of times you play it but then you get use to the scares which i hate (. DLC's The DLC's expetially the ones with the survivors and killers i think are totally worth the bay due to the fact yull be playing longer than the actually worth of the DLC and the dlcs are just really cool.10/10 would again
1;I really enjoy this game. If you guys watch the second trailer ( the one with the black girl in the tanktop running away) that trailer is insanely accurate to what the game is like. This game is amazing and when youre running away its very scary. The killer walks so close yet they cant always see you BUT YOU THINK THEY CAN. So you clentch your and pray you live.
1;"""started out you can destroy a hook silently for 1000 ptsnext you can destroy a hook which alerts the killer and get 500 ptsnow you can """"disable"""" a hook which still alerts the killer for 500 pts. The hook repairs itself after a few minutesfuture i suggest the devs give trapper the ability to repair destroyed traps so that sabotage will be completely useless and killers can complain more about gen rushing"""
1;Dead by daylight is a very interesting game. Ive been supporting this game since beta and i coninute to support and play this game to this day. its been interesting to see what the team has done to this game from changing mechanics adding new survivors and killers with new abilities and more. I would recommend this game to people if you just like to have to have a good time with friends and be warned there are quite a few bugs in the game.
1;Love this game! Play it almost every day it's such a fantastic concept and very well done. The game mechanics 'story' aims and such are all great. The only problem I have with this game is that it does have a lot of glitches! (and the matchmaking is stupid XD) but it's still really fun despite that. Good to play with friends and with strangers!EDIT They've fixed a lot of stuff now! The matchmaking is great and there are a few glitches now and then but nothing like it used to be!
1;I love this game it's quite nice I reccommend buying it.It's improved since it's beta and got rid of problems. It's probably still a beta to be honest.But all in all the game's improved a lot the community is just Salty Survivor and Killer mains though. Pros Fun Game Luck Tension Cons Killer DCs Salty Survivor/Killer Mains Bug Abusers/Forum CryersThat's all I have to say about this game. Pretty fun.
1;Dead by Daylight is one of the best horror multiplayer games out there! Once you learn how to play you will have loads of fun chasing or being chased. It does contain features that could be improved but the best way to resolve all these issues with the game is getting more players and more community feedback. If you enjoy being under pressure feeling adrenaline and jump scares this is the game for you! Hope you enjoy your long nights playing it! Highly recomend it!
1;I have been obsessed with this game for the past two weeks although the gameplay is a little repetitive having to do the same task over and over again but the different people you queue with make it different each time. I STRONGLY reccommend this game.
1;This game sometimes makes me want to punch the absolute crap out of my monitor while shoving my keyboard down my throat.The game is full of camping killers and idiots who constantly fail skill checks despite there being a noise right before the skill check.Also doctor don't play him or I will actually come to your house with my baseball bat wrapped with barbed wire and nails and beat you like Negan did Glenn in TWD
1;Product received for free. I think this game is great but it really needs serious updates. I think it has great potential and can go even further. Not only that it is also replayable you really never lose intrest in playing. Should deff buy if you havent already
1;Ridiculously fun and addicting. Puts you on edge at first but after a few times playing I feel oddly calm and can't seem to stop. XD Teamwork or solo you can pick either one D And with the different characters there's a few choices if you get them leveled. Highly Recommended!
1;I love this game. My son and I play it all the time. Sometimes it is extremely frustrating like when the killer is a face camper but it s still quite fun. I especially like the fact that even if you don t own the dlc for a particular killer you still get a chance to play with those killers on their maps.
1;It s a very great game even if you have over 300 hours it s still fun to play. So many Killer and survivors you can level and play how YOU like. A bad point is that the games can be so short because of how fast the gens can pop which Killer makes camp so they get a guaranteed kill and maybe some others who try to help. Another bad thing is that the community is one of the if not the most toxic one i ever saw.
1;If they can implement better system to report cheaters and hackers it would be much much better.But for a 20 dollar base games it was actually above expectation of what one can get out of it and the variety of killers and survivors characters is pretty amazing for a somewhat unknown brand and company behind it.
1;Do you like having utterly usless dull empty self preserving teammates? Then this game is for you. This game is so mind blowingly about caring about only yourself that even if you go into this as a saint you will exit molded as a self preserving So if you don't enjoy that stuff be a crazy OP killer as long as you dont get survivors who have grinded their sweat blood and tears to become a God within this game. What am I trying to get at? Great game just play with friends.
1;fantastic game sure there are a few bugs but that to be expected it is still in development and regulary recives new updates and dlcs and the devs have live streams constanly the game play is a mix of sucpence fun horror and adrenaline and the gameplay is unique and fun would recomend 100%
1;Love the game been playing 80+ hours on it. Though I find the new killer which is the doctor is severely OP. His shock at lower levels reveal's survivor's positions which is incredibly OP. Not to mention If you're anywhere near his AOE your insanity will slowly keep rising. Then there is also the displaced shaking skill checks which I think is too much considering his shock already reveals' player's positions. It seems like a copout to make everyone buy the new pack imo.
1;"""Game is the best i played but there are campers with Chainsaw like Hillbilly or Leatherface (I like Leather but i do not like when somebody is camping). I do not like Nurse cause she is teleporting by a """"floor XD"""". BEHAVIOUR should nerf Michael Myers's 1 lvl stalking (that mean they should increase his terror range). Btw. game is very best."""
1;"""It'd be such a great and amazing game if you were able to get a match. Worst matchmaking I've ever seen in a game before. Should rename this nonsense """"Dead by Matchmaking"""" or """"One Match by Daylight""""EDIT Now that we can get matches a lot faster I'm back to loving this game. It took far too long but we are on the right track."""
1;Dead By Daylight is a great game even with the community sometimes being toxic The developers really do show they enjoy what they've created by choosing to keep updating and making new killers for the game along with a map and new survivor. The games best with friends but even without them it doesn't take anything from the enjoyment of the game with four other random players you can get from online.
1;I'll be blunti have spent a lot of time in this game and it is very addictive however there are many things that need fixing although i have found myself immersed in the gameplay as both killer and survivor so for the amount of money i spent it was definitley worth it so it deserves a positive rating
1;This game has up and downs but with the continued support by the devs this has so much potential. Even at its state now it is so much fun. The grind reminds me of why I play video games. One tip is to start off with Claudette and get her Self Care perk. I would recommend you get this game although it can be a pain in the butt sometimes.
1;A really cool game. Despite what it may feel like it is actually pretty well balanced as well. It can be hard for a beginner to really get into however you can really enjoy this game for a long time thanks to relativly frequent updates and the ability to play with your friends. (And it also goes on Sale from time to time)
1;So i buy game a long time ago when infinites were normal and survivor legs were just like a tentancle D and i culd say it was happy time i spend here yea sometimes it was rage couse i was laming in this game at start so bad xD but i culd say it is worth buying it ) i spend 350h in this game and i dont regreat it
1;I can play this game for hours and not get bored. It's a fun game to play alone or with freinds. Also it allows for a lot of customization for the characters that makes each one unique. Pros Playing with freinds is fun and easy No two rounds are the same / Never gets repetative New DLCs quite frequentlyCons Sometimes the game will glitch and get stuck in the middle of a loading screenCan't really think of much cons because this game is generally a fun game to play with few glitches.
1;This game has quickly entered into the list of some of my favorite games. The gameplay between both survivors and killers is rather balanced. Even if some aspects are inbalanced you can easily find a way around it. Understandably this game isn't for everyone. But those who enjoy competetive gameplay and survival horror types where you can't fight back this very well could be the game for you.
1;The devs have recently thrown a few patches at the game and I must say that it's been very positive so far. Firstly the lobby simulator seems to be of very little issue now. There is a delay when playing with friends on Steam that could be addressed but it's a much better experience overall. The graphical changes have been great too and the whole game feels different but in a good way. Definitely recommended and good fun with friends.
1;i will say that i love this game but also will state this game has so many camping killers the second the killer has someone on the hook they won't leave and i played both sides and i dont camp or teabag but people who camp are the main reason why this game makes so many people mad so i do recommend it but beware of the camping killers and if dbd team do punish the campers then the game will be perfect but thats all i'll state and i do love the game.
1;A fun game that now has little bugs and alright matchmaking amazing to play with friends Or solo! playing a killer is great too I've sunk a lot of hours into this game but I got tired of the repetitive gameplay and the game breaking bugs when I came back to this game bugs were gone and It was fun again and I found it more stressful to play as a survivor which I liked It's a very fun game and if you have a friend to play and skype with it's amazing
1;Fun in low ranks really annoying in high ranks (as a killer main). As much as you may enjoy this game it's a competitive game and competitive players will try to win no matter what taking away the feel of the game. Either way it's a good game pretty balanced and it keeps evolving with new survivors killers and other features coming out periodically. Would recommend.
1;New Review the developers fixed alot of bugs and they are constatly adding new things now i can recommand this game DOld Review THIS GAME IS SO ING EPICThe game is beautyful but IT'S THE MOST BUGGED GAME.20 minutes of loading and the game kicks you.30 minutes for waiting players if you're the killer (without considering loading time)Until devs don't fix all those things i can't recommend this game even if i like it and i'm still playing it
1;Amazing game iffy community.Both Killer and Survivor are equally fun as long as you can forgive and forget all the campers and gen rushers. As long as you have fun and make little mistakes then you'll enjoy the game 100% of the time. The only thing bad about the game is the community so as long as you don't hit Rank 1 (joking) you'll always have fun games. Would recommend 11/10 times.
1;Really fun game when it works Which seems to be less everytime I try and play it. Long waiting time to join matches if you at all can get into one. The game ends up crashing alot on matchmaking.Edit Been some months since this last review and since i played the game. started playing again and i must say that all the mistakes and glitches has been taken care of.recommed 10/10 espcially if you play it with friends.
1;a survival game that i just can't stop playing. i'm glad i was introduced to it. the only downside to DBD is that you'll come across the occasional game changing glitch/bug. it's a bit annoying but they're still working on tweaking the game. otherwise great game. i enjoy it greatly.
1;Game itself is fun and fairly balanced. Main issues are the connectivity there are constant issues connecting and getting into matches. Seems like every other week there is a bug or exploit going on. Game could use some fixes but it hasnt stopped me from having plenty of fun with it.
1;&gt Be survivor&gt team mate got hooked at the first 2 min&gt *do erobics while on hook&gt camping killer alert&gt goes to save him anyway with other teammate&gt i let the killer see me so he can chase me&gt got rekked&gt tfw team mates abandoned me10/10
1;Every since i got this game I have been addicted. It has a nice variety of killers and a surprising amount of stretegy. I love the perk system and the extra layer it adds to the game. The only issues i really have had with it is that some killers are seriously under powered such as freddy krueger
1;Product received for free. Hello!This game is one of the most great horror games.I know it since last summer and I would recommend it to my friends but there's something I don't like sometimes in the middle of the game or when I am close to escape the game takes me out and is very annoying.So please do something about that.Thanks.
1;If you actually get to play it's a really good game but in general be prepared to wait for ages to be placed. I wish they would finally fix that issue. As it is I usually play it if I have other things to do otherwise not worth staring at the computer for half an hour before you actually get to enjoy. Too bad if it were just for the gameplay itself full points...
1;The gets from me 10/10.But sometimes every 4 5 games it crashes on a desktop. Today is 22.08.2017 and it still do this.My system Windows 10Intel Core i5 4440 3.1 GhzNvidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti 2 GbRAM DDR3 8 GbSo game is good but it can leave negative emotions because of crashes.
1;This game is fairly fun at lower ranks of the ingame ranking system not so much at higher ranks. If youre playing alone Id recommend playing for fun instead of playing seriously until you get a good grasp on how things work. If with friends be prepared for the killers not wanting to play against your groups its one on four and the killer is alone without anyone to talk to for help.That being said be nice and respectful both sides. These are real people playing along side you.
1;Extremely fun! The horror is subtle but when it's there it turns into another 80's horror movie a small amount of gore although sometimes I wish there was more. Gameplay wise the game is amazing. Visually I think the game looks great the rugged look of everything adds alot more atmosphere.
1;I bought this game almost when it came out. It was really back then glitch under map killer gets teleported outside the map waiting in que for 1h. But now they changed it so much fixed many bugs and glitches. I stopped playing this game for 8months and came back just by a feeling. It is super fun and I 100% recommened this game to anyone that wants to play a puzzel/horror and fun game.
1;I'm loving the game except when a new killer is added to the game and he is most of the time overpowered. But on the other side there are fixes/updated pretty often for balancing things and fixing bugs. I really love this game both from the killer and survivor perspective.
1;Where do I even start with this game. Dead by daylight is one of my favorite games to ever come out on steam. This game has brought me so many funny and scary moments that I will always remember. Whether you're playing with friends or by yourself this game will always be a go to for me.
1;i was thinking i beleive the clown is pretty op. either it might just be were not getting used to it or its a little crazy i had an idea that the clown should reload one or two bottles at a time. or you could recover a little faster from the intoxication. once you get gased... your getting down theres nothing you can do.
1;the game is great amazing actually i never get bored! great job! bc alot of games do get boring... but more killers would be cool like pennywise jason a werewolf of somesort or even chucky the killer doll! but overall love the game thanks! BUT we do need more maps!
1;This is the most fun I've had in a long timeIt feels like you're back in school playing Ditch 'Em but you get to slaughter your friendsThe feeling of being chased as a Survivor feels like it is straight out of a bad dreamHighly recommended wish they'd add an AI option to play offline when the lobbies are sparse
1;Product received for free. Before the 1.4 patch it was a great game and it still is. Sure it has some bugs from the patch but obviously it will be fixed just give it some time. I love this game to death so this is the reason im recommending this and like i said give it some time for them to fix their mistake.
1;Bugs. What are you all talking about? Heck yes. There are many bugs. Heck yeah 50 % of my games someone leaves or im getting deathcamped because Im a noob and falled into the killers hands. Do I recommend it? Still. Yes.Its thrilling its adventureous and its fun to play. Bugs are not too heavy on my side. It launches fine i can get into most of the games fine. Buy it if you have some friends to play this gamew ith.
1;The game features a 4v1 gameplay style that can go from being really easy to complete destruction in 1 simple mastake. Unfortunatley the game is ver limited in it abilities to be able to achieve a very please game e.g. all the perks and addons to change the game completely. In all its a good game if you dont give a sh*t but if you do you will have a bad time.
1;Great jumpscares and layouts of maps. great graphics too. it's pretty addicting when you get the good killers that dont camp on hooked survivors though. bad thing about it is the constant camping of killers. they would hook a survivor and not leave them. if they can maybe the devs should penalize the killers that do this? make them lose blood points for how long they stay near a hooked survivor? movement speed decreases? lose a pip? something to keep them from ruining the experience of the game
1;It's a great game if you don't look at it in a too competitive way. Don't expect to play the next esports game but expect a fun game where you can play a few quick matches and have a great time killing survivors or outrunning the killer.Being high ranked doesn't give you any extra's besides some achievements and your rank gets resetted every month on the 13th.
1;I have to admit that I love this game to death but the amount of malarcy both killers and survivors have to go through mainly killers has really made the game become less and less enjoyable for me. I'm still recommending this game because I believe the devs could still turn all the imbalance around and fix it. But in its current state you will need a large tolerence for annoying people and losing the game to stupid things commonly.
1;I've spent many many hours playing this game and watching it on Twitch and it's been a great time. Surviving with friends is especially fun. It's not perfectly balanced but I do think the devs are listening and it really has improved over time. Overall lots of fun.
1;#BEST GAME Very fun and challenge Co op survival game with friends. Dead By Daylight will bring you many ways to survive run hide or die from the Killers. You'll find yourself with a group of more three survivors trying to complete only one goal power up remaining generators to open the exit gates and win the round.
1;This game has a love hate relationship between people who primarily play killer or survivor. You can play with your friends as survivors or queue alone. On that note If you don't have any friends to play with or like singler player experiences playing killer is really fun.
1;This game is so much fun.Sure it can be frustrating at times with waiting forever in lobbies and toxic players but the feeling you get when you finally hook that annoying survivor who's been running around like crazy or when you successfully escape a killer chase is amazing. I only have 100 hours in this game (so far) and it's already been super interesting. Overall I have to saypretty good job so far
1;"""Really addicting game. Fun as both killer and survivor. While some aspects still need to be fixed such as depipping as survivor because a killer leaves the match it is still squarely in the more good than """"needs work"""" category. Don't give up because you don't get it at first it's a lot of fun once the inital confusion wears off!"""
1;Alright starting this game it got me HOOKED i thought everything was gonna be all DWIGHT This game GENERATED lots of fear even though the killers totally BLIND sided me! Sorry for making you BEAR being TRAPPED in this WEB of puns! (totally didnt steal this)
1;Very gud game the only thing I don't like is recently I got all my stuff reset so i don't have any of my points or levels. Fortunately I made a back up save a week earlier so i'm partially relieved because I would've lost 210 hours of me playing this game and grinding up points. Plus there is way to many bugs and glitches for this to be a released game I got stuck in pallets about 5 times and i only had this game for the 200 hours I played this.
1;This game I have gotten so addicted to it! The perks are amazing yet sometimes really unfair! What needs to be fixed is the ranking system. You get queued with a lot of skilled players in low ranks. Maybe also add 2 killers and 8 survivors! That could be a really interesting challenge! Over all amazing game! Love the concept
1;This game has a simple setup but it's execution is masterfully done it has an insane amount of replayability and the devs are very committed to keeping the game balanced and fun also the mindgames you play against or as the killer are the best part and if I'd explain why this review would be way longer. Definitely recommend this game you get a game that's easily worth 60 euros for 1/3 of that price!
1;Take the role of survivor and work together with 3 others completing objectives and evading the killer.Become the killer and ruthlessley hunt and sacrifice those pesky survivors. Dead by Daylight is an intense game of 1v4 cat and mice with a large cast of playable characters and cunning strategy.
1;I have a few hours in this game and it still scares the out of me. When everyone plays the game properly it's a very fun and enjoyable game. But with any game there are campers and trolls and that doesn't make the game as much fun as it could be but overall I absolutely love this game and can't wait to purchase DLC
1;It's a super fun game if you can get past the toxic people. There are a few bugs that should've been fixed a while ago and the one game breaking bug has been there for far too long. Unfortunately sometimes the game will totally wipe all your data and you have to start over again. This hasn't happened to me yet but if you do get it then back up your save file.
1;Great Game......Gets Updated So You'll Erm.........Never?..... Get Bored........I'm Uhhhhh...Not Good At Reviews.....Do I Even Review Bro.....Bye......Hi......Ok Whatch This....*POOF* *RUNS OUT OF THIS REVIEW PRETENDING THEY DISSAPPERED*..Bye! BadSpelling
1;best game ever play at night with no lights and headphones it will scare the crap out of you please make sure you do these things or it wont have that effect you can play it during the day too but where noise canceling headphones makes it creepy and dont what ever you do dont pop the generator because he will find you and then your hooked like a hooker lmbo
1;No not recommend. its full of bugs addictive camping killers survivors are nerfed to the ground the perks dont always work. Played the game alot I liked it when Killers did not camp when teammates went for saves.BUUUUUUT even though I did not give it a positivie review and did not recommended it I still played it. So your choice.
1;There are a few glitches that can be worked on but overall this game is super fun if you're into survival horror games. After playing for a while I don't get as many jumpscares but I still do every once in a while. It's all in good fun. No matter how many time you get triggered and rage... you still come back for more.
1;Killer covered in blood wipes his/her weapon so it doesn't get bloody. 11/10 Would wipe again.Honestly though the game is really fun. If you exclude some bugs you find here and there it's a great game to play. Definitily more fun if you have friends to play with especially if you are chasing them as the killer! )
1;Let me start off by saying I love this game BUT I hate the community. Most killers will complain about how the survivors need to be hard nerfed while survivors hate all killer mains. But if you are ever in need for a laugh go to the DbD forums. It is a well intresting place.... All in all I love this game.(P.S. There are glitches like they can be game breaking).
1;This game has it's faults but I keep coming back to it. There isn't anything like it that I've played. The dev's are well intentioned and do make changes often. My only gripe would be the community. It's outright toxic the less you have to do with other people in the community the happier you'll be.
1;EDIT Still really fun and the developers have become increasingly better at being involved with the community and providing more content updates!Great game lots of fun and there's a little bit of variety and surprise with each round. The game can get a little bit repetitive but It's a constant challenge and I love the suspense of each round!
1;This game is good but i think producer should fix more this game bug and unbalance . When i join lobby or loading game they should have a loading template. Finding player or finding game is too long. I dont want to say or complain this game but this game need a Revolution.Although the game is great but there are still a lot of things need to change And i hope producer make me proud
1;Fun and addicting game can be agitating at some points but got me addicted plus my friends. Some things are wrong with it though 1. Killer's are trolls recently because of the ranking systems 2. Lots of bugs and 3. Not an in game chat. I would recommend putting in a similar one to that of friday the 13 where it's proximity chat. But all in all I find this game to be a blast!
1;I think they did a pretty god JOB so farr..Fun game addictive...and soo ing frustrating at times but i have about 250 hours and im not even close to be bored of this game....by the way the hag sucks please rework them oh yeah and sometimes when playing as survivor the killer i play against its from ing solomon island and he has 1000 ping...if you can do something about the matchmaking too..
1;There are times in this game where my heart is pounding as much as my character's. Very well done. Love the balance. There are others but this one adds an element of surprise. You don't know who you're up against until the match starts. Unless of course you are the killer.
1;This game is qutie good. But it's going to bad because ... (just my opinion) the server is suck ! Why can't use the middle server than Killer's internet that make ping so high. but I still love this game develop still be around us do this game move on. hope keep it that way.
1;This was the ultimate Party Game for my Halloween Party. It left a lasting impression on those that have played it and wasn't easily forgotten. We still play almost each and every night on this game as a party of four. The thrills the spooks and of course the daily grind of becoming that pro survivor. Every little mistake a game changer every great skill check a blissful reward. This game is THE ULTIMATE SUVIVOR COOP.
1;Loads of fun especially with friends. The only real problem is the still buggy sometimes unfair and just overal randomly kicking you between the legs matchmaking system which doesn't seem to be a big priority for the devs (?).Other than that it's easy to get into and you can do a quick match whenever you have a couple of minutes to murder.
1;Sometimes we cant click to help friends from hook and after new patch i always dc and found many bug and this patch ranking system is too bad i find rank and i found killer rank1 but our survivors is 15 12 20 20. It's not balanced. Plz fix this for good game.
1;My favorite horror survival game its very fun but once you get expirienced it gets boring after awhile. I think the game needs to add a different gamemode like 2 killers and 8 survivors just to keep the existing members interested. But other than that a great game with occasional bugs and glitches but still fun. )
1;Product received for free. My friend gifted me this game for Halloween. Very fun game play loop for both killer and survivors. The progression tree is fairly quick to unlock perks that make each character fall into a unique niche. Have had a lot of fun playing both together and alone. sp00ky/10
1;A fun game whether you have 10 hours or 1 000. I've been playing since Beta and still get immersed to this day. This game is best played in small doses and I think as long as you don't take losses too seriously you'll have more fun. Despite matches having the same goals every one is different because you're constantly playing with/against different people! The replayability is super high and I'm still enjoying it over a year later.
1;Have poured many hours into this game at the time of writing this review and haven't regretted it. Dead by Daylight is always there for me when I need a game to play by myself or enjoy a good time with my friends. The game can be suspenseful at some times but it just makes it even more fun in my opinion. Gameplay is fun and the community can be great depending on who you talk to. Don't hesitate to pick it up you won't regret it.
1;"""As I silently loudly fix this broken generator. I turn my camera around to see if im being watched. No one in sight. I continue to fix it for 2 minutes. I start to hear heavy breathing. I turn around and 3 count em THREE metres from me is Michael """"fricking"""" Myers The Shape. I scream loudly break the generator even more he stabs me puts me on a hook. Then I bleed out and wait for a teammate to save me. 10/10 love this game so much."""
1;Honestly mimosas and the little half niglet Claudette just make my night. I think this game is a total 10/10 if you enjoy salty that enjoy face camping you and then flaming them afterwards in chat. I've had the most fun whilst getting farmed by every asian that comes past me when I get chain hooked because of the hoe. All in all would totes recommend to the common autist. Thanks and a lovely day.
1;I think Dead by Daylight is a really great game. I bought this game last year in July and I stopped playing because of face campers making the game less fun. Then I started playing it in September this year and I'm having a great time playing games that i haven't played in a while and I just love it.
1;I think this is a really nice game you can kill people or you can not be killed you gotta be smart and a good listener for both survivor and killer cuz you never know whats gonna happen when you walk around so if you like death and sacrificing and stuff this game is for you btw its brutal lol
1;The Game is fun tho many bugs both funny and dumb can get kinda boring sometimes but u kinda come back after some time and of course amazing characters I really recomend playing this game but it will be more fun if u have other people to play it whit u then i recomend to let them try the game and maybe they will buy it too see you in the game&lt 3!!!
1;This is a fun game it's in active development and new updates have been ongoing on a reasonable schedule which keeps it pretty fresh. I really hope they end up adding different game modes at some point might be fun to link together maps and adding more killers/survivors or even turning the tables and giving the survivors an opportunity to fight back? I don't know but I've got plenty of hours into this game and plenty more to put in before it's all said and done I'm sure.
1;90% of your games will either be up against total noobs who have no idea what they are doing or you will be against some one who has all the ultra rare perks and has 1000 hours plus matchmaking is so unbalenced it's unreal. but it is good fun playing as killer or surviver so i think its worth 15.
1;I think this game is cool you should buy it even if you have a potato computer. I have to decrease the resolution and the graphics but it's worth it. Only buy if you're not alone because this game is too hard alone. The game is kinda scary at first but you'll get used to it. Old Man
1;Graphics 67/100Framerate for middle end pcs 46/100 (could use more graphic options to raise framerates)Community 56/100Gameplay 75/100Balance of killer to survivor ratio 39/100 (survivors have a bit too much power over the killer)________________________________________________________________________________Overall 76/100________________________________________________________________________________Good Game________________________________________________________________________________
1;This game is pretty simple 4 survivors try to get generators going to escape the level before a killer sacrifices them on hooks. Rinse and repeat that for every level. That being said it's pretty fun to play. If you were to play it a lot it would probably get repetitive. I think this game could hang around for a while if the developers continue to push out updates and DLCs. Time will tell. I purchased it when it was on sale for $10 and at that price it's worth it.
1;Although I have my salt momments they go away and this game makes quite a fun experience.It might have toxic players but you are not forced to read their hate.It requires a lot of strategy and lately it has received many fixes and additions which greatly improved it if you were to compare it to 1 year ago.I am very happy of what is it has become and there is no reason not to play it if you saw it liked it and you see it on a sale.(also if your PC can handle it too D) 10/10 piece in my library.
1;It's not outlast 2 but the nurses breathing is strange....If you want to enjoy this game play it as a survivor with 3 friends of yours.You will destroy the poor killer )))This game needs good hardware.If you have a 300$ laptop don't bother in any way.
1;I love almost everything in this. Well balanced scary and nerve racking. Only the bad things in here are the people who camp. They are extremely annoying but with some good teammates its still doable. With friends its even more fun and on the plus side you can take adventage via a voice over. DLC are fun good balanced and are very varieted from each other.Would love to see some more emotes (for taunting killers P)
1;This game is ing amazing but let me tell you why.The game is FILLED with bugs and even if they are being worked on (the devs DO care) it seems that for every bug fixed 2 come out. Sometimes is a little glitch sometimes is game breaking but in the end EVEN with all of that the game is super addictive super fun spoopy and best played with friends. I absolutely ADORE it.
1;Really good game and great fun to play it wil friends ! But for me I can only play half of it because my internet is a bit so I can't play killer ever. Really hope they change how the peer to peer matchmaking works so that it chooses the person with the most stable connection and not the killer only also the random loss of progress is a fantastic way to off your player base!(edit Killer works now so good game D)
1;Fun with one or more friends. If you're alone...it can be fun but mostly it's not.Badly optimalized bugged lobbies...which sometimes can be REALLY annoying. So if you can't stand this it's not the best game for you.The killer can scare the sh*t out of you. It has a good atmoshpere sometimes you feel totally helpless...it's part of the game DIf this game is on sale give it a try )
1;I ain't gonna let no level rank 1 camp me and mess my rank up.No but actually this game is very good on the aspect of making you drop some down your hole the killers are cool and the survivors....well lemme tell you 'bout..................................................................................................................................................................................FENG MIN
1;&gt Killer starts playing seriously. It's actually pretty skilled.&gt Killer hooks the first survivor.&gt Survivor suddenly disconnects.&gt The rest of us start pointing at killer and spamming duck button.&gt Killer becomes friendly. Lets us get XP and gets for himself as well.&gt We are now best friends.10/10 would practice social reintegration again.
1;This game is awesome but it was buggy.NOW I'm changing my review as per November 2017. Bcoz the developer really care about the game and fix several bugs already. Thank you DEV!THIS GMAE IS A MUST PLAY it is the 2nd best HORROR multiplayer game in the history of gaming the 1st one is DECEIT!
1;This game has definitly higs and lows but overall its a fun/frustrating game to play. I main survivor but play killer from time to time and trust me when I say some of the killers need nerfs/buffs/etc. but theres nothing you can do about it until its recognized by devs so complaining isn't going to solve anything.Good Game.Worth the money.Especially fun with friends. Practice your killer skill because the SWF groups can be a bit tricky.WORTH IT!
1;i dont know why u guys split the countries into there own regions?? cant you make it so people in new zealand search for players in australia and newzealand automatically? because there are very few players in newzealand i have to change my download region through steam in order to actually play the game
1;there is only one thing i can say and that is the doctor he is literally my hard counter im a big baby when it comes to scary games dead by daylight was tolerable more adrenaline pumping and anxiety giver than scary and then my first seconds into playing against the doctor made me hate him and loathe him with a passion with the doctor as the killer i have to play with one hand covering my face good game doe i just hate the doctor for being good at what he does
1;there is only one word i have to say about this game. yes. since i got this game 5 months ago i loved it from the start. tho some bugs and broken killers/perks have been added into the game overall the game has progreessed. is it perfectly balanced no. is it next to bug free no. is it fun yes and that is all you need to know.
1;Dead By Daylight has fun addicting gameplay with a nice leveling up system for your characters. Perks add variety to your abilities and each game is unique depending on your choices. This game got me back into multiplayer after giving up on shooters. I can happily play this game from my couch. Highly recommended game that is a great value.
1;For people looking to buy DbD for the sale do it. It's a great game and the negative reviews shown here are mainly residual salt and the game has improved a lot both with bugs and balance and general polished ness so dont take the top reviews here as definite. Its a lot better now and was before.
1;This game is extremely fun to play with friends. Although there are times where it is glitchy when trying to start a game together and you have to create a lobby together every singe time it is definately a better expierence with friends. Now that that's said some of the DLC Killers are a bit overpowered but the more that you play against them the more you learn how to avoid and escape them. It is all part of the expierence. It is a fun game and worth the money.

1;Great game not finding any reason to stop playing replayability is good although if this isn't your type of game then you won't find much replayability. Haven't got very far into the game perks/progression wise only 1 character to lvl 50 nearly 2 with 83 hours (although i may have been afk for a few hours idk).Overall a good 4v1 horror survival game(if your into to those things) and i will hopefully play for a lot longer then what I have. Also screw you campers why do you do what you do?
1;No skin on my bottom lip from nervous biting as survivor. When killer if I lean in closer to my screen I can catch survivors faster. 11/10 would accept as gift from friend once if not twice more. UPDATE Over a year later the additional killers and improvements to progression have kept me truly addicted.
1;Didn't think i was going to like this game at first. Started getting it to it because my friends were playing and I loved it. It is just really enjoyable surviving with friends or when no one is on you can just go on a murder spree on strangers. Overall I do not think it is overtly unbalanced. There is always an opportunity to win against anyone.
1;The game was very fun well done graphics are on point their are some glitches but only one major problem with the game that most need fixing. I lost alll of my progression after about 1 2 months of playing because of a steam file saving issue. Dead By Daylight needs to look in on that issue majorly. I am currently not playing the game because of this issue but hope that it won't happen to anyone else.
1;I got friday the 13th on my ps4 and it was alot of fun. But it got repetitive after a while so i got this game. its so much fun you dont even know. its a bit repetitive but what game isnt? So for 20 dollars i would most definitely get it if youre into slasher games. XOXO Arealbot .
1;Been enjoying each single minute of my playtime in this game. Though the game to times are a bit buggy/laggy it's still entaining. I would recommend playing with atleast a friend or if you're up to the challange try teaming with random people which at the same times makes the game harder since you never can predict your teammates or the killers next move.
1;"""Used to be called """"Waiting Simulator 2016"""" but now I enjoy it. The only part that is a bit frustrating is at the beinging of each month when everyone goes back to level 20 so you have people who are really at level 1 playing against players who are truly 20's. Game is fun and the developers are always adding new features and hunting bugs. I'd suggest getting the game and waiting for holidays to purchase the DLCs."""
1;Far far FAR too glitchy and buggy for a decent recommendation at this point.The gameplay itself has only a few bugs exploitable match ending AND inconsequential.The menu has too many bugs for me. The main being IT WILL CRASH.Over the past two nights I've played it's taken (both playthroughs)FIVE RESTARTS of the game just to find a match.They need to fix this immediately. They have since fixed this game. It's a lot smoother and more balanced. This pleases me.
1;Waiting for Lobby Simulator 2k16.Don't get it you spend 20 minutes searching for a 10 minute game.EDIT As of October/November 2017 the matchmaking System has been greatly improved and as far as I can tell there are no problems finding a lobby and playing. I have played extensively in the past days and found a game in mere seconds. Updating the Review to now recommend the game.
1;Pros and Cons Pros Fun game lots of fun when actually playing as both the killer and survivor tons of replay value. Level up system is interesting and varied and the perks help enough to see the difference but not so much you can't play without them.EDIT Servers fixed! love this game!
1;This game I have killed 700 hours and it still has me drawn in to this day it has a level of skill and levelling that is different and interesting but in no way revolutionary. This game has the constant repeating game which I like while others may not find it amusing. I recommend this game 100% and hope to see this game grow into the incredible game it s becoming.
1;If you're a horror flick fan and always wanted to be a brutal murderer (or run from your life against one) this game is for you. With each new DLC Killer release (some even free) adds on a totally new insane layer to the game. Also Bill got left for dead so now he's in this game!
1;I think this game has a lot of thought in it and a lot of effort put in it but this irritates me a little how ot says its co op but if you and one of your friends want to play this game you have to do a private game insted of inviting them to a lobby then eithere doing a private game or moving to a quick join so you can be in a game with one of your friends and 3 other random people
1;I would like to say that the DEVs are wonderful. They listen to the players. There's no such thing as a perfect game and I admire the dedication that they put on this game. I sincerely would like to thank the hard work and effort they put into this game. I gladly recommend this game now before with the bugs NO. But now... YES!
1;fun game with friends you can bait them as you are getting pursued by the killer so that you can escape leading to your friends getting hunted leading to you hearing them just swearing at you as they get dragged into the basement by the killer... which makes you save them for the free points and continue the cycle.
1;Despite some longer wait times that can happen with online multiplayer games DBD is extremely easy to pick up fun and exciting to play and even more fun when you start mastering each character's abilities. This game is truly addiciting and gives you a rush of adrenaline that only a good horror movie can provide.
1;"""The classic """"You need the DLCs to have the full experience""""Besides that it's a good game not much to say just that the system matching is total almost every rank 20 get's to playhh with a killer with rank 10 or better wich doesn't sffect me and shouldn't affect anyone after you get used to the game."""
1;"""Really fun game to play with friends!! It's okay by yourself if you're playing killer. My only issues are the matching system and that you need a good computer to play well. Also you don't get bloodpoints in """"Kill Your Friends""""... still highly recommend!!"""
1;There are still bugs but to me the game is fun to play even with different play style such as gen rushing camping pallet hopping and so fourth. Sure you will get ****** off in this game it happens. The killers only want to hug you and keep you there forever.
1;There's quite a bit of free content that comes with the game and continual updates rebalances and new content is added regularly. There is a large fanbase and plenty of people to play with. It is definitely frustrating at times for both sides but I've had a lot of fun playing the game.
1;Dead By Daylight is fun game where u kill the people you call friends or randoms you play as one of the stabby people and kill the 4 people who want to leaveas the survivors you have to repair power devices and open the exit door as the stabber you have to hit the suvivors and hang them on fish hooksit is fun game
1;This game is fantastic and very fun. This is the best game I have ever bought for $60. After a major update along with a string of smaller updates DBD has become close to bug free and is now very playable. New content like maps and charecters for free is appreciated. The devs have now allowed you to play with your friends and strangers in a way that actually works so major plus there. I would st rongly reccomend this game.
1;Easily one of the most addicting games to play.Highly recommend this.Playing as the survivor is very challenging at first (IMO) then you learn some tricks from playing killer.My favorite killer so far would have to be the nurse.I dont own any of the other dlc.Although I am thinking about getting some for the killers.Hag seems a bit much tho too campy.
1;Edit Fixed! )Very buggy lobby. I can't play as killer with my friend and 1/10 times the game crashes in the lobby. Despite these issues my friend and I both experience they have released a number of DLC. Why create DLC when you can polish your game? I wouldn't support developers like this and I wouldn't recommend this game.
1;Dbd is a great game After you deal with the few people that taunt and facecamp you get to the real gameplay. The game has so many interesting gameplay features that have not been seen before. Dead by Daylight is a great game that I would proudly recommend
1;This has to be the best $20.00 game I have ever played. It is pretty balanced whether you play suvivors or killer and the devs actually listen to the community. There is still some work to be done on the game but they are going in the write direction with every patch. Keep it up!
1;Honestly one of the best Multiplayer Horror games ive ever played.with the contstant growth and expanding interest in this game the develepors are working hard for the best performance for the player.they listen carefully to what the players have to say and adapt their game if needed.the gameplay gets better as the game progeresses. been here since the BETA and have seen a lot of positive changes bugfixes and expansions.overall id rate this game a 9/10 !! thehook
1;its a nice game somtimes laggy but if you love the game like i do then this is the best game you can schoose you just need a good internet if youwanna play killer when i bought it i had some problems but i just redownloaded the game so thats al the problems but the game itself is AWESOME!!!!!
1;My absolute FAVORITE game EVER. I'm addicted to it. I recommend it to any true horror fan.Also don't be a killer main or a survivor main. Learn to play and appreciate BOTH sides. I play both killer/survivor 50/50 and I get much more enjoyment out of this game now.10/10.
1;very very very goood game the only issue i have is i always get the infinite loop of loading and im very fortunate to actually get into a game. The devs really need to step up their game theres too many bugs i really wanna play all the time but find it absolutely ridiculously hard even trying to get into one.... INFINITE LOADING neeeds to be fixed!
1;Fanatstic game regularly updated by the devs. My only complaint is the huge chunk of the community who insist on abusing each other post game win or lose. If you're going to be one of those people buy something else. If you are a fully functioning human who can play a game and have fun without getting salty then dead by daylight is well worth playing.
1;EDIT I had told myself that I would change my review of the game once they patched some of the bugs in this game and they have!Originally I did not recommend this game due to the myriad of bugs that actively worked against you. Thankfully the DEVs stepped in and fixed them!
1;I played this game with some friends and hot damn it was fun!Dont be in it for the win but for the thrill.Its absolutely nervewracking and its nice to finally find a game that has some challenge to it!And its rly nice that you can save your earned blood points so u can use it on any victim or killer to upgrade em!All in all i would recommend this game! (y) D
1;This game is extremely fun to play even more so with friends. Some players are more annoying than others but if you don't get toxic players then the game is highly recommended by me. The game is also kind of competitive so if you don't like that then the game may not be for you.
1;Bought this game on sale when I felt like trying something new..And I have to say I am very impressed. This isn t a 20 hours in and I couldn t be more bored sort of game.The first week of playing was a heart pumping thrill ride!! Second week of playing was time to get serious and start hitting my strapsThird week in and I am not slowing..When your hands are shaking from fear/excitement/coffee.. You know your onto a good thing!
1;Why do I bother reporting CNTV was bady blocking which you specifically get reported for and yet he is still online. YOu guys need to focus on that more or say to all your fans that you let griefers go through the game freely. This is a good game just please fix this.
1;This game is the the future of survival horror the wait times and constant re readying up has made me defecate in my pants countless times. The real fear of being in a lobby looking for a couple people for over an hour has turned me into a hardened veteran of the game. The bloodpoint system is cool too.
1;Cons Laggy Servers (no ping screen) waiting time (1Minute 2hours) Bugs (Stuck in a Tree lobby problems etc.) Fix all that and its a nice game. Update Ping Screen is now in the GameWaiting Time drastically decreased to 1 5 MinutesSom Bugs still thereNow it's a nice game )
1;This is fun in its self the comunity is like LoL toxic but its still very fun to play for hours on end. If you can look past one side either Surviors or Killers being OP for weeks then definately get this game if you are easily triggered by what people say or do then dont pick it up.
1;I love DBD great concept and the devs can do a lot more if they listen to community. Bugs don't the game up as much as people say what ruins the game is camper killers.(Devs NEED to fix bug that doesn't let you win after you escape through door instead it leaves you to walk around out of bounds in a never ending game unless you get escape hatch or killer kills you. Happened to me last night and weak killer didn't even let me get hatch after I rekt him. )
1;Game is fun definitelly recommend for a group of friends who want to play together. Its still kinda unbalanced in different aspects. There are issues like bugs camping toxicity crashes... But overall its a unique game give it say 1 2 years and all of the issues should be fixed(maybe not the toxic ppl tho )
1;Dead by daylight is a very fun game with a lot of things happening everywhere so this game is for people that have good reaction and think smartly. I think that this game has a very good age barrier and has very good quality settings and Dead by daylight is super fun but even more fun with friends you can play multiplayer both with randoms and friends. You can also rank up your characters and use four different abilities there is over 20 abilities you can choose from.
1;sure its still a good game even tho theres many bugs n more. i still can handle n fine iwth it. it just...toxic community. i dont really like those ppl who just randomly called someone noob. well respect pls? theyre probably new or just not play da game for a long time. this all just make me remember of those ing kids from cod or cs who never shut their mouth n keep troll/insult people randomly
1;Very active player base and a huge variety of killers. It is a game that can induce massive amounts of salt but the majority of the player base takes it on the chin. It's constantly being balanced and updated as well. There is a lot of love poored into it from the devs and it's definitely worth the full price of admission.
1;Soooooo much fun to be had in this game. Play with our without friends you will enjoy your time surviving and escaping the killer or taking on the role of the ruthless antagonists your self. Does not get old especially due to the incentive given to the players through all the perks items and add ons that can be acquired.
1;The game without DLC's is medium ballanced but the DLC Killer are P2W.Look at the pig. It can't be heared like the ghost plus has a short sprint boost and traps which are more powerful than traps from the trapper. All these abilities together in one killer! WTF?And it has a lot of bugs but you can have fun with this game.So I can recommend it but only to buy while a sale. It's not worth for more.
1;Really good game but there is some issues that needs to fix . first thing is too many campers and this games need system like banning campers and let other players play normal . there are also too many bugs and thankfully they being fixed . Game is very funny and i'm really enjoying it &lt 3 Maybe there will be too many updates in ther future thats makes game more interesting .
1;Dead by Daylight is a fun online multiplayer 4v1 horror game where you must survive for your life by repairing generators or kill the survivors to please the Entity with your sacrifices. You can play with your friends and try to survive the trial together (or not) and makes the game much more enjoyable for casual players.
1;If you like to mine salt you will love this game. Play as killer and every game the survivors will be salty regardless of if they win or lose. The games community can be pretty toxic but its worth dealing with for this game. After 100+ hours I still scream everytime i turn my camera around and see Mike Myers staring at me.
1;Great game I absolutely love it. However it is not for everyone. If you are ok with dying over and over and over again you will be fine. You will get mad quite often at first because you aren't used to the game. Control scheme is the same as most games so you won't have that as a learning curve. 3rd person survivors and 1st person killer makes for a new style I haven't seen in many games. And lots of cat and mouse ant OH GOD A BEAR TRAP!
1;This game is awesome! In the beginning its not so good but when you learn how to actually flalight blind and save people from the killer it starts to get intrested one thing really cool is that you can moonwalk me personally I can do it but only for about 5 7 seconds don't get discouraged.
1;this is one of my favorite games but i have a few gliches to report1. there is an odd glich with pallets if you pull one down at the right time the killer will get stuck 2. there is a glich where when the game ends sometimes your cursor is invisible and its very hard to find the exit button3. as the trapper (it may happen with others) when you start the game your camera doesnt circle you sometimes and when that happens and the game starts when you walk you can see your head bob up and down
1;Great looking game with horror but not to much and teamwork but not to much either this game is amazing graphics whise and gameplay wise and i also like the characters back stories and unique traits because it adds favortism and connections between you and your survivors it would be cool if they made a 2 v 8 match making where there are 2 killers 8 survivors and a lot of generators and chest will be in the map. it will add numbers and replay value to the game!
1;If you love running around mindlessly being chased by a killer and expecting a lot of bugs then this is the game for you! Just kidding... it's pretty fun if you don't come across campers and just BM killers/survivors in general... and also if you enjoy a cold slippery and pointy metal thing being shoved into your upper part all the time then this mIGHT just fit you perfectly c Happy surviving/hunting
1;This is to recommend the serious attitude of the studio towards Chinese players and the fun of the game itself. But this human onslaught will seriously affect the gameplay experience of the survivors. I understand the purpose of the horror game but asymmetrical games need to be balanced in some sense.
1;If you want the fear that comes with running/hiding for your vitual life from a living breathing blood hungry muderer you have found the right game. If you seek the thrill of hunting down your weak coweredly prey then by all means join in on the hunt. This is by far the best multyplayer game ever.
1;The game itself is alot of fun in a slasher film kind of way. sometimes when I play survivor I find my heart pounding like a drum. It can take some time to get into it at first but I personaly love it. The only major flaw I have with it is it's kinda hard to connect as a survivor for me but I can always get a game as a killer.
1;simply put the best 15 i have ever spent!Recent patches balance the game ever so slightly moreStill an issue with certain killers not being able to stop gen rush But overall fun expierence only adivce to any new players close the chat as it CAN be toxic
1;Dead By Daylight is one of the awesome online survival game i had ever played. I recommend this game to all those people who likes to play horror or survival games. Once you purchase this game believe me you will be happy as ever for any game. I will support Dead By Daylight Forever.
1;100% my favourite game the wide variety of maps survivors and killers means this game doesnt get old as long as you dont mind a lot of salt like even more than csgo. If you don t mind grinding in games buy this because it s so worth it it can occasionally be buggy but more often than not it s hilarious. Relatively easy to run as well.
1;It isnt a solid 1vs4 game. But it is a very fun and good 1vs4 game.Much Much MUCH better then evolve.If you are looking for a game that you both can play with friends (it is very fun with friends) and solo. And like a little horror. This is for you.ps. there are some small issues/bugs but the developers are moderately updating the game and soliving the issues )
1;I have sank enough time into this game to say I have thoroughly enjoyed this game.Throughout the updates and patches it really has improved the experience overall.For what its worth I do believe somethings need to be balanced a tad better but its great to survive with friends!
1;I would recommend if all of the bug get fix and....pls have a new type for the searching game When I plaing with my freind who's rank 5 and I'm 18 its took around 30 min to find that freakin lag room....so pls fix this one first and you'll have a lot of fun for this game.
1;Super fun game that you can't play without pulling your hair out unless you have five people or wanna play solo. There's no lobbying system. It will literally take you an average of maybe fifteen minutes to get in the same game which is all for nought if the players don't connect. Buy it when it's playable.Edit It works now. Buy it.
1;Previously I had complained that the various bugs made the game unplayable. As of 1.03 there are still bugs but they seem far less common or egregious than they were before. The game is now fun to play it's far from perfect but I can now feel comfortable giving it a good review.
1;Honestly I get really scared of horror games but let me tell you THIS GAME IS ADDICTING to play. I played for two whole weeks and it's really fun. There are some bugs and glitches but not a whole lot. The only downfall is the players rather than the game the game is prewtty good but the community is kind of toxic by toxic I meant facecampers/normal campers. The physics in the game are super well done.
1;I haven't been able to get into a match sense the update. When I join a lobby and the game starts to the load screen I lag out? i've tried a couple time's and it just seems not to work..Even though I'm having problems I still recommend the game..even if everyone is still an .
1;Don't listen to any negative reviews on this game. If you read them you can tell that they are salty or haven't played enough to even know what they're doing Please give this game a chance you won't regret it. It is simple but very addicting and so much fun.
1;The Only game i play more then DbD is Counterstrike i love this game the hate the trolls and mostly the salt in so many games )Balancing can be better survivors just too op if right played. The Killer looks like a barbie dolls in so many games.But in the end and overall good game and definitly worth a buy for 20 or lower price!
1;"""I used to love this game. The style and design intrigued me and it was so addicting to play. However the game no longer will start it would always say """"launch error"""". Anyway I highly reccomend this game if my issue has happend to anybody else I am sorry for that but once again this game is phenominal."""
1;I absolutely love this game. Even though I really suck at being a survivor I enjoy being the killer. I love the new direction they are taking this with actual killers and survivors. Now if they could add Ghostface from Scream and Sidney Prescott that would be great. Until then keep up the great work.
1;The game is overall fun but comes with its share of bugs and glitches as well as the ability for some maps to have spots where the killer can never catch the survivor. a side note to this is that the devs are looking into this stuff a lot and are preping patches and fixes since the end of E3.
1;I do like the game it is only really fun with friends. Too many trollsThe graphics are alright the sounds are decent the gameplay is nice and all of the features work well together. but problem is you will have wait for so long to find a lobby so i hope they will fix it soon. other than that Game is great never get bored )
1;h1 How to play Dead by Daylight /h1 1. Wait for 6 hours to get into a match2. Use perks that you will never have time to use3. run away from the killer because he found you in the first 3 seconds4. die because all the killers are overpowered the nurse is a motherFu... 5. rage because your teamates dont save you6. get no points because you died7. switch to killer8. be epic because its immposible to lose as killer9. ???10. Profit
1;This game is endless fun and it scares me from to time But it would be AWESOME if they would fix the matchmaking lobbies from making you wait a long time to find a lobby and some bugs in the game but since they added a new killer it looks that the devolpers do want to make this game more enjoyable so hopefully they will hear our cries and try to make us more happier but other than that the game is pretty dam fun and is worth my money!
1;I like this game because you can feel like the prei or the predator you can feel the fear that maybe you can get killed or you can fell the trill of the hunt as a killer maybe som patch are up and everything but devs are very responsive they try their best to keep balance or atleas they are trying and they put alot of attention to they public you can check reddit if you want they read all about us and apply suggestion etc. give it a try
1;If you except the pallet vaccum changes the camper killers face camping killers the toxic survivors (me) and getting hit and the killer not even touching you... its a great game... I have 300+ hours and Id say its one of the most addictive games Ive had until they removed the pallet vaccum D
1;The game is amazing I'm perfectly content with it being a party game for me and my 4 other friends. Bought it yesterday and we played it all day. Fun game wish you could play with friends in the matchmaking system but other than that the game is amazing.
1;There is one objective for 4 of the 5 players....SURVIVE. This game is a blast! Definitely worth the money 17 dollars. I was hiding in a basement the killer looked at my locker then went to the one accross the room. I was able to escape but man was my heart racing. This game is so much fun. It reminds me of the fun I had in the original left 4 dead
1;"""Developer1 now for the final ingredient """"a pinch of salt""""Developer2 .......thats not a pinch of salt SteveDeveloper1 im sure it'll still be fineDeveloper2 that was a full cup of salt Steve im pretty sure you just ruined it.Developer1 lets just continue with it.Developer2 yeak ok."""
1;This can get so addicting as I am a huge fan of the horror genre in general but I'm sure people of all tastes will come to like it. Even if you are not such a fan of serious or scary games it can be hilarious if you let it be. Dancing in front of the killer to distract them from a friend can be terrifying or a big joke depending on the player. I definitely recommend this game to all.
1;After over 300 hours on xbox and pc combined I can say that I love this game. The graphics and gameplay are amazing and the backstory is left vague giving it a real horror feeling to the game. their is so much variety between matches (excluding red ranks) and it is always a thrilling experience. The only downside to this amazing game is the toxic community so if u can handle that and love horror then this is for you.
1;&gt Plays as a toxic Laurie&gt Has max level DS&gt Killer downs me and picks me up&gt Perfectly lands my DS skill check&gt TBag the now stunned killer&gt Killer disconnects10/10 best game on internet.get italso if you want a teammate just add me i'm happy to play )
1;I first played this game for about 20 hours when it came out. Only really played killer and loved it very much. Then about that time PUBG and some other games got super popular with my friends and I took a break from this game. Decided to come back and 280+ hours later I love the hell out of this game. It's really fun chasing people around and killing them. Also playing mind games with survivors is so great.
1;This game is tons of fun and me and alot of my friends love it.That being said this game would be better if their were some changes such asmore game modes (one gets kinda boring after a while)easier ranking system (its a horrable system tbh)and more killers is a personal prefrence im not gonna talk about a matchmaking system with friends since thats being added into the game )
1;Well can't deny the salt in this game but despite that it's so fun with friends every match is like a movie. For example a killing getting your friends and you are faced with bitter options like leaving your friend behind and running for your life or trying to save him and risk getting caught as well. really fun and updates are decent bugs are funny dunno why ppl complain about them too much. totally recommend this.
1;Love the game well and truly.But god damn when you join a lobbdy and load into the game and either the host leaves straight away or too many players leave so the game ends.... YOU SHOULD NOT LOSE OFFERINGS OR LOSE SURVIVOR RANKS FOR THIS. Like seriously wtf? Please fix.
1;The whole game is amazing &lt 3 buuuut ... there is more turning on and off the game than playing. Every fu*king time i play one game there is no chance to play a second one witchout crashing.This game have a big potential and it have a lot of updated but not the once that they need.PEACE &amp LOVE
1;The lobby isn't working properly sometimes I'm teleporting due to bad connection or so. However I like this game it helped me to overcome fear of being chased. The community is quite good not that salty and rude as in the other games but there are also exceptions (unfortunatelly). Also HIGHLY ADDICTIVE game.
1;This game is really great and I would recommend it highly! The Devs are constantly working on it and improving it so hurray Devs!!!I won't lie the lack of dedicated servers sucks because I am at the mercy of not only the killer's internet but how far away from me they are. There are still bugs in it but they are being worked on. Anyone who claims the Devs don't listen or care probably just doesn't like some of the changes that were made or are not being patient for one specific fix.
1;This game is great! Its fun to play alone but when you start playing it with friends the only time you will play this game is when your friends are online because playing Dead By Daylight with friends is one of the BEST experiences you will have playing a video game. However there are a lot of bugs that I would literally suck off the devs to fix. But other than that this game is fricking great and I 100% recommend if you are looking for a fun game to play with some pals.
1;This game is insanely fun to play. Playing the game with friends or without is fun and addicting. Good heart workout. You will always feel like you are gonna have a heart attack. Enjoy the game. It is worth every penny. Have fun and Sweet Nightmares. 9/10 rating.
1;"""Dude You Should Make a Villian of Chucky And For Survivor Andy...I can just imagin a faded voice """"Hi I'm Chucky Wanna Play?""""Or Have a Clown from the movie """"Stephan King Called It Classical"""" And also instead of forest In Underdead Malls w/Elevators"""
1;This game was great until new updates doesn't let me queue with any of my friends. Even with a 2 man group queue takes over 10+ minutes. I played alone enough to where playing with my friends were preferred due to being bored. I been trying to play with my friends since the new year started )
1;This game is very fun to play I thought the overly simple premise wouldn't hold up for multiple play throughs. I was very wrong. You will get owned the first few times you play either as a survivor or killer but once you get a few games under you its a real blast.
1;I REALLY love Dead By Daylight but the problem i'm having is..I have a MAC. I used to have a windows but since i got my MAC I haven't been able to play Dead By Daylight. So If Steam could possibly make it possible for MAC people to play Dead By Daylight on a Mac please do so . Thank you &lt 3
1;Stupid anti cheat check is too slow (takes 2 minutes in average some times 10 minutes+)and has 1/3 chance to fail (I didn't do any cheat to the game).Today(Dec 14) I've spend 1 hour on loading &amp restarting again and again without a single successful game.Except that it's a good game.
1;Dead By Daylight is esentially a jacked up version of tag. More specifically it's a jacked up version of cat and mouse.With that said the main thing I want to focus on is that if you go in to have fun. You will always have fun. This game is mecahnically super sound. they have a great amount of content for the price. Most important though is that you will walk away from the game with stories and experiences especially if you play with friends. 100% DBD is worth a try &amp worth a buy.
1;Product received for free. This game is 2 years old but still gets updates I really like this game.Fun alone but its funnier when you're 2 or more. It's easier to communicate and win.This game will trigger your weakpoints and make you scream like a little girl.And yes you will get extremely triggerd on some of these killers.But after all great game.
1;This game is so much fun obviously it gets repetitive after awhile but because the developers actually seem to care about their games it gets updated in a reasonable amount of time so there's always something new to make the game more interesting. The way the developers made the story line of the game is so fascinating I've never seen anything quite like it!
1;One of the greatest games out there I have played. There are 4 Survivors and 1 Killer where survivors try to escape by activating generators and opening the exit gates while the killer hooks survivors and sacrifices them to the Entity. I love this concept in this game plus the DLCs and characters you can play as survivor and killer. I would recommend this game if anyone is interested in a game like this a 4v1 multiplayer horror survival horror and co op.
1;Very fun to play whether you are a ruthless killer or a cowardly survivor. Work with your friends or don't to survive the trial. As a killer kill your friends to appease The Entity. I have yet to queue up with actual friends but it is still very fun to play with complete strangers. Heck sometimes a friendship develops because of a mutual understanding throughout a trial.
1;Player is irritated by another players.But it has been enjoy for me since I play for 100 hours.this game seems simple game because of seeing twitcasting.Further killer simply chases survivers at this game.However all killer is numerous addon(add power to killer) and ability.For example shot walp chainsaw seeing or and so on.this ability change how to chase so We am not bored.Let's play this game.(caution) there are numerous whip for this game's charactaristic.
1;I saw this game come in go in the puiblic spotlight for many months until I recently decided to purchase on a friends recommendation. I was honestly impressed from the get go. The amount of thrill in escaping a killer or finally opening that exit door is unmatched in most other games.
1;Dead By Daylight is a really good game. I reccomend it to people who love horror games. If any of the creators read this comment i would really like it if ( and this is just an idea) if GhostFace could get implemented into the game. He can teleport to lockers as one of his abilities. Again this is just an idea
1;Worth buying and playing. The community is ok to nice also the best thing in this game is that your skill is in the center ( sometimes luck counts a little bit too) You can play whenever you want and with who and how you want. If you are not a that gets triggered fast for every single thing then this game will just suit you.
1;Out of 10 stars I would give this about 8. The match making system seriously needs an over haul where your rank determans the group you get put with. Would love to see more outfits for the characters also. Other than that the game is quite fun playing solo or co op with many chalanges that keep you on your feet. All in all i would recomend the game.r
1;such an interesting game asymetrical 1vs 4 u chose to be a killer hunt for survivor or be a survivor to survive the trial... on the first glance people will judge u for playing this type of game esspecialy if u play as killer... but later they will undertand.....ps dont lose heart just becouse the game had some toxic player just play to increse your lvl get some bloodpoint and level up
1;This is one of my favorite game this game can be fun and scary at the same time i love this game this game got a great comunity a lot of bugs but bugs that makes the game a perfect game in my opinion this game is great to play with frends and sometimes solo very fun game
1;This game is fun to play as both killer and survivor. If you play killer be prepared for everyone to call you camper whether you actually are or not. If you play survivor you will probably do fine because the more expirenced players will keep the killer in a loop while you hold m1 on a generator for a minute.
1;Hated it solo loved it with atleast 2 friends then it finally became really enjoyable. Except when you're always the one spawning next to the killer/dying first.Match queueing simulator.It would be a lot more fun if it wasn't always laggy as thanks to P2P.If I didn't have to search 25 times to get into one match.If I didn't get kicked out of a lobby everytime I found a match.
1;A very fun and tense game. It feels great to skillfully dodge the killer on a survivor and help your teammates while decimating an entire group of helpless people is amazingly fun on the killer's side.It does have a few balance issues but the developers attempt to patch weekly and fix bugs in a semi timely manner as well as have weekly streams about what they're doing.
1;"""I've changed my review to recommending the game because it seems even though there's still the problem of having to press the """"search for lobby"""" button multiple times instead of pressing it once and waiting overall it's much easier to find lobbies now and swf is not complete garbo. Although balancing is not the greatest and there's still plenty of bugs to go around overall it's still a very fun gaming experience. Nice work with hotfixes devs."""
1;it's very fun and can get addicting the more you play just note that there can be many frustrating moments such as salty killer/survivor very good players or mabey even survivors blocking your escape. just focus on the good parts of the game and do your best in the fog )
1;This game is a FANTASTIC fun multiplayer game I would defiantly recommend to anyone that loves horror movies like me this game does great on all of its designs on killer and maps and over all it's just a great game that deserves a lot of props for the overall amazingness of this game.
1;Overall its a Brilllent game lots of stuff to unlock different characters to play different killers to play loads of perks to mess around with new content added every 3 months on average.Like most games thou it does have its fair share of toxic players toxic killers camping killers tunneling killers trolls and cheaters.But dont let that stop you getting the game you dont game them that often and it really is fun to play.
1;Ik my avatar is cancer but here is my review. This game is fun afEspecially when its the pig or any of the characters you have to buy theres also stuff you can get like toolboxes and med kits to help you survive the only thing I wish they added was more stuff to hide in like under beds and if they added where you can lock doors and I wish they added crawlspaces so you can crawl under houses.
1;Dead by Daylight is such a unique game you can experience the game from both the chaser (killer) or the chased (survivor) POV. Quite a simple concept but requires team play strategy (sort of) and luck. Being a multiplayer game you can play with friends (and even kill your friends!)One thing though I do recommend starting as a survivor. Once you understand the game mechanics then try playing the killer You will definitely suffer as a novice killer!
1;So this game is fun. But has a couple of bugs that still need to be fixed. They aren't that game ruining though and if you have played Evolve this game is better and is also the opposite version of it. 4 Survivors vs 1 killer. Both sides are very unique in perks and abilities. 9/10 IGN
1;Was about to delete from my library but then the Curtain Call Mid chapter update came out and made killer challenging to play against. As a survivor main I find this awesome. I hated winning every time.There are still some smaller balance issues but overall this game is insanely amazing and addicting now. Salty survivor mains spamming negative reviews are just toxic sore losers. Actually take criticism and improve yourself ya big dummies. Stop dwelling in the past and move on to become better!
1;When you want to hunt or escape something need excitginf experience many way to play the game outstanding characters and costumes. Dead by Daylight can meke you feel like that. Sometimes you can run run run hide hide hide help help help your friend. Each day you have any mood. Sometimes you want ot kill someone torture or pretend survivor. Support your any mood.Try it. Escape or Kill'em all.
1;This game does a great job of making you feel your role when you play (scared and nervous as a Survivor the need to murder Survivors as a Killer). Of course you'll get those Survivors who have no fear because they are monsters themselves p Definitely recommend if your looking for a thrilling gameplay experience. Note This game is a ton more fun with friends when playing as Survivors than going as a lone Survivor with strangers (although still fun not AS fun).
1;Do you like to sit still and have a staring contest? Well THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.This game includes the following features you'll love Facecamping Pallet looping T bagging flashlight blinds Tunneling Bodyblocking Sandbagging Lag switching Bad Matchmaking Buggy hitboxes and anything that is related to bugs Bad Game coding getting stuck at something Hackers Farmers AFK killers Salty Survivors/Killers AND MANY MORESoon to come )
1;from when i first started playing killers were good and survivors were in a good spot. Now the tables have turned and it feels like killers are agitating and really limited to what they can do as you get from ranks 12 and below you start to really see the struggles of the killer. being a killer as of this review is by far the worse mistake anyone can do.
1;This game is freakin awesome! I had pre ordered the game funny enough the game released on my birthday! It's an awesome game it really gets tense this is a true horror game. The updates on this game are so dope every time the game is having a update it's becoming even better!
1;I rate this game 10/10 best game everPROS Best dlc price! great game the devs update the game like every week and idkCONS i know facecamper right? i really want a co op killer but survivers get 5 Gens 6Still af game bae//my price that i would like// //13$//
1;an overall fun game challlenging to to win either if you are the killer or the survivor. the only issue i am having is while a match is loading after the offerings and items have been equipped you will lose them if you take too long to load into the game and been kicked to the main menu.
1;+ I really like the game! Its really cool! The thing I hate about the game is that there isn't enough people playing and its really really hard to find a room The killers always camps and watches you die and your teammates cant save you!The game needs a lot of fixing...The new update for halloween made it really fun!
1;Hi!It s being a lont time since I last played DbD but I have tried to get in again since a few weeks and the game doesnt launch. Everytime it charges but then it says Launch Error and only a Exit button.I have tried to redownload the game 2 times but it just doesnt works. May someone help me please?Thank you very much. Reyix
1;Probably best to buy on sale. Good solid game which a few debately illogical mechanics however can be very fun with friends or solo play for either role. Consistent updates and events alongside a reasonably sized dedicated fanbase. Queues are rarely long. Overall 8/10 Dwights
1;Really great game all though i've had some issuses in the past with my lobbies never loading up (i've waiting for up to an hour before with no one entering). Hardcore pallet looping survivors is a very fustrating issue that sometimes really makes me never want to play killer. Camping killers is really fustrating when playing survivor as well. but all in all when you get some decent people playing together its a pretty great game.
1;Dead by daylight is an amazing game that I love to play. I currently have almost 300 hours in the game but the game also refuses to let me play 90% of the time Ive been sent back to the campfire Ive been playing ready up simulator and now I am playing Cheater detected simulator. I cant seem to find a game as surivor or killer and I have restarted steam multiple times. Its a great game when you can actually play it.
1;Honestly the only bad thing about this game is with certain players. Those that too tryharding to hoard points themselves that either playing selfish as a survivor or guarding the hooked player until that player dies. New balancing is done periodically so the problem is getting less.
1;I don't know what's worse the fact that swedish methheads with a ladyboner for flashlights bully me every waking second of my matches or the fact that I've started hanging my pizza deliveryboys from meathooks in my basement. In all seriousness the one thing this game has taught me of value those in the closet deserve to die.
1;This game has a TON of bugs and ping. But luckily the devs often fix it and deveop new contents. So if you don't like the game with a lot of bugs and ping don't buy it. But if you don't mind that point you shouldn't miss this game cause everything else is good.
1;Welp.. I got this game 5 days ago... Since then I have not slept due to the terror and have logged 65hrs in the game /Do not buy this game if you like being able to sleep. I can't stop playing!Do buy this game if you enjoy being hunted chased and scared sh.tless while you run for your life and try to escape!!

1;"""I love the concept of the game but sadly you can only play survivor at the moment because the game is extremely unbalanced so killers wont have any chance against a good survivor team. Thats not how a horror game is supposed to be. """"This is outrageous it's unfair!"""""""
1;Awesome game. Currently have little over 200 hours into the game and I recommend it to players that love a good jumpscare if you play as survivor and taking time to master your killer or survivor. Once you get good at the game you will learn it is very easy. There are sometimes bugs and rage moments but if you are relaxed and try to have fun this game will be so much fun for you.
1;Ignoring those bugs this game s a good game.I prefer playing survivor in this game playing with friends and having fun. Killer is quite hard to get rank up and also hard to open up a game lobby since too much player in killer nowThe rule and system of the game is quite interesting atmosphere is really scary. Good game overall!
1;I honestly really like this gameit's dumb frustrating and the players can be pretty toxic but at its core it's a fun multiplayer experience that captures the essence of the horror movies it seeks to replicate (most of the time). It's a unique game and I think it's worth a play.
1;Totally worth it. It's not perfect. It has a lot of flaws but this game has come so far and will only go further. The devs are actively making this game better and coming out with new content all with their community in mind. I highly recommend this game.
1;A really suprising game! I had or have so much fun with it. The only problem I have is that sometimes they have difficulties with balancing the game for both sites. But nvm a great game D!! I am waisting hours on it but it was totally worth it so far...
1;Dead by Daylight has a great concept and is executed well. The only problem with the game is the balance changes that occur after every update due to an unbalanced perk or an unfair advantage on one side or the other. It has gone through so many changes since the beginning some for better and some for worse. It is a good game currently but I personally prefer early patches of the game.
1;A great game with a lot of fun intentions.... The community definitly tries its damnist to ruin it out of 8 games about 5 of them will have the survivors feeding with the killer and when you don't play along they just off you. Its really cool when your teamates decide to get you off the hook right infront of the killer just so they can down you 2 more times. I love the game but people are making me dislike the feeding system reaaaaaly hard right now.
1;The first steps of the learning curve are the hardest after learning the basics its quite easy to polish your weak points and learn new moves.8/10 Pros lot of theorycrafting and skill to developcons i dont like some killers mechanics&amp stats like freddy / the pig you have to google info about all the killer's perks in order to dont give easy kills noob killers arent punished enough for campingSomething you have to use before playing your first gamehttp //www.mistersyms.com/tools/gitgud/
1;Ever since I got this game it's been my favorite. This game is awsome in its own ways. The Devs are always updating and adding new things. It's really addictive and I guess in a sense somewhat scary.Pros AddictiveFunMultiplayerCan play both Survivor and KillerCons It's unblanaced in a waySome survivor perks are just too stupid and overpowerdSurvive with friends is really hard to play against if they know what they're doingOut of a 1 10I would give it a solid 6 7
1;great game! i love playing it as both the killer and the survivor but with that said the level of toxicity and salt in the community is insane. If you have a thick skin and a no to give attitude you are good to go but if words hurt or you suffer from low self esteem stay far far away lol
1;Can you make changes to the queue where you can't queue with the killer as a friend. It really just kills the game when your suriviors helps the killers to kill you. I am getting a lot of these game where my teammates just puts panels down of no reason and also they lead the killers to others. They also unhook us right in front of the killer this just really kills the game. But this game is pretty good just need to fix some stuff to become a great game.
1;Game is extremely fun once you get into it It takes bullying to a entire new level because now you can blind a killer with a flashlight and he will never get you! BUT DON'T WORRY They can place bear traps and use a chainsaw to mow you down so you better bring those long life battieres and Low Amp Filaments.
1;I watched a couple Twitch streams and this game looked exciting and scary. Once you start playing with friends it's incredibly funny and scary. You have no idea how many times you'll get startled or scream especially being hunted by certain killers. It's very entertaining but playing solo queue isn't as good.
1;I don't write reviews often but I felt this game really deserves one as it blows me away by how immersed I can get while playing it. Everytime I am actually on edge trying to stay fully alert when I play as a survivor and have even screamed at one instance where one of the killers completely took me by surprise. First and only game to ever make me have a reaction like that an instant favorite just at how into the game one can get.Forget 10/10 just buy it already
1;It's a pretty fun game overall. The grind to get characters up to par is a bit tedious and annoying as you cannot go up in ranks as a solo player without ranked up perks (which require ranked up characters. Playing killer and survivor are equally fun. Survivors have a better chance of escaping if you don't play the only two really good killers
1;Tried it on the free weekend. Within 5 hours of gameplay I went ahead and bought it (on sale 9.99). Both sides are challenging and fun. Its better when you are playing with friends that you can talk with. If you don't join as a group you will be in a match with randoms and no way to communicate with them. Overall its definately worth the $10 I have abandoned many other more expensive games before I will this one.
1;Good and bad. The gameplay is fun the graphics are excellent and the sounds are great but the community is absolute cancer. If you play you'll be killed cheaply survivors will escape cheaply and you'll be insulted for being too good or bad (or just 'cause).
1;Pretty damn broken game. Still I love dis game. The devs started to make the killers stronger and survivors weaker. The pallet vacuum has disappeared they will nerf ds selfcare etc. They are buffing killers so I might change from survivor main. Still very fun to play and as always being toxic.
1;The game might be a little twisted from the killers point of view but if you don't like to slash people's guts out of there body then just don't play killer! I have almost 200 hours now but half of those hours are afk hours but the 100 hours I have actually played i've enjoyed! So if you're looking to get this game I hoped I helped &gt
1;I absolutely love this game. Don't think of it as a competitive game and it'll be great fun. Starting and learning the game can be a little rough but the developers are constantly working on it adding new things and are so involved in the community. New killer (The Pig) is so well done very cool concept and lots of fun to play as and against.
1;$20 for over 800 hours of fun (at the time of writing this I m sitting around 820). Keep in mind this game is actually quite competitive a lot more competitive than one might think but the high skill ceiling for both killer and survivor make it a game you can constantly work toward and grind out.
1;Highly recommend this game. Why? SUPER fun Cant get enough of it And is awesome playing with friends. Although you can't join your friends in a public lobby im sure they will be fixing that. If you like games they get your heart racing then this is the game. Just a heads up if you buy this game you will get super frustrated playing the killer But when you snag a survivor and hang them on that damn hook. You will feel like the most accomplished person on the planet. 10/10
1;The game in itself is a super fun party game it has good mechanics and bad mechanics the devs seem to be caring somewhat about the community but the community is pretty 2 sided and salty at eachother everything has gotten alot better recently but it will never be a good competetive game its more of a Jackbox at this point.
1;I've played this game for quite a while now and I can finally say that its going in a good direction. Many new maps many new killers and frequent changes to perks. I can finally say that if I lost this game for whatever reason... I would buy it again.
1;I am a very experienced player in Dead By Daylight and all I can say about this game is that it's a good game but i left the game for a time a very long time and i came back and stated that not many things changed they added new dlc and new map etc they fixed a lot of bugs but there are still more so i'll give a 7 / 10 for this game because of the bugs and there can be more optimization in this game.7 / 10 )And the last update made a sound bug when u move camera )
1;I find this game to be extremely fun and enjoyable. It isn't really scary (unless you play against Michael Myers) but it can be challenging and difficult. It is also even more fun if you play with friends. I constantly tell my friends to pick up the game all the time!
1;Just good fun a game that does not t its customer base just good blood thirsty killing fun DEVs are cosntantly fixing little bugs and keeping ontop of any exploits love playing both killer and survivour. Would definitley recommend it and this is coming from a bloke who plays games like Dayz WoWs and WoT not my usual tittle but damn im enjoying it. 10/10
1;It is a great game. really fun but not ment for weak minded people.The toixic unreal hatred from survivors is a part of the game it seems.The survivors will use their toxicity just as much winning or losing.I dont play survivor myself its way to easy to win as a survivor thats why i play Killer.Its a real challenge to try win as a killer and im realy enjoying it even if i lose.
1;Very enjoyable game into which I've sunk many hours. It has its flaws and its occasional bugs but on the whole I'd say it's well worth the money. DLCs are usually good and reasonably priced. If you want an assymetrical PVP game and you enjoyed Evolve or the L4D series then there's a good chance you'll enjoy this.
1;If you get hooked and see someone hiding behind you its already too late you are now just another victim another name to be added to that persons farm list The only way to pip now is to farm your farmer and turn him into the victim .Also when you have farmed the ever living out of him you must now fulfil your destiny and farm the rest of the survivors The entity demands it.
1;Great leveling up (permanent reward system perks n sutff) system. Keeps you on the edge of your seat with consistent horror elements. Nice graphics and pretty smooth gameplay. Lots of stuff to choose from to customize how you want to play and the game is always improving even if slowly.
1;This game has quite a few bugs and a few can just destroy your match and immersion but it gets more and more killers survivors and items each year. I will definitely continue to play and get the DLC content for a while as it is a fun game with a clear difference between hardcore and casual on both sides of the coin and the developers are trying to make the game better with their streams and fixes for either over or underpowered killers and perks. I would recommend at least the base game.
1;Love this game. Only about 150 hours but it is one of my favorite games to play to date.This game is still kinda buggy even though there's updates often. It's more of hide and seek at this point with the killer because some items are unbalanced but they seem to be getting ont track to fix that. Hopefully more positive updates to come.
1;Its not done still has a ways to go but is fun besides the bugs &amp people constantly leaving lobbies making the match making times incredibly long sometimes.. Just needs more skins for survivors &amp killers ways to talk to teammates ingame party system &amp bug fixes and this game would be ideal. 7/10 for now
1;Short review (6 17 2016 Might expand later) + Fun cat and mouse gameplay+ Interesting teamwork/solo balance gameplay+ Different killers/perks/tools/procedural level elements to mix things up Several minor release bugs (Certainly soon to be patched) Many players blowing up my generators lol. PSeriously though very fun game with randoms or friends and minor issues that will certainly be patched up soon enough. )
1;I really like this game just wish the mechanics were better. Joining the game at a later stage makes you feel like everybody else is too over powered to have a fighting chance. Overall I'd recommend it but feel it needs a little work specially with the lobby system as if you are playing with friends you have create a lobby after each game. i.e. Create lobby play one game then you have to create a lobby again to play another round seems a bit bonkers to me.
1;This game is bugged as . randomly kicks you from the game. lots of lag. getting in to a game takes forever have to hit the ready button every 5 seconds and there is no reconnect becasue the game is hosted on the hunter computer (hence the large amounts of lag). you cant turn the music off in the game menu (super anoying).... this needs alot of work to make it run smooth. do not buy intill they fix this so this changed a couple months ago its a pretty good game now.
1;The game needs better matchmaking.. I just started the game when I play as a killer the survivors are way higer leveled than me and have great perks.. When I try a survivor guess what it's the same for the killer.. I thought this game was supposed to do match making based off level or something.. Other than that its a great game.
1;"""A game where you can experience bugs like no other. From flying to space spawning on top of a house is where its at. The developers are incredibly autistic and boardline braindead with the game. Fun to play with friends. """"I think we've done a pretty good job so far"""" A Dead By Daylight Developer"""
1;Dead by Daylight is a good survival horror game. I like this game because this game contain different types of maps survivors and killers especially licensed map killer and survivor. I will recommend this game to all those people who likes to play survival horror games.
1;I don't know if it is only me but sometimes when i play as survivor and press find a lobby it would just be stuck on waiting.I get off and on the game just to play 1 round.Can you please fix this problem because other then that it is a great and really fun to play!
1;At its core it's a 5 player horror survival game where 4 players take on the role of survivors and 1 player take on the role of a killer. The survivors' objective is to activate 5 generators located throughout a map and make their escape. The killers objective is well to kill the survivors.
1;Before patch 1.5.1 &gt Don't buy it you will die waiting for a match... I never played an online match only with friends. Was 30min waiting for a match with 2 friends then we quit the game. Next hour we tried again but this time with a full team 3 friends with me same thing after half a hour we quit the game.Fix &gt changing server to uk londonNOW patch 1.8 it's PERFECT a few bugs but very playable!
1;This is pretty cool game for those who are like horrors and want to know how to be victim.Would be good to add a bit more abilities to do something. Not just launch the engines and totems and suitcases.Would be good to have some another opportunities.
1;Product received for free. This game is so amazing! I love it every match that I play i discover a new way to win rescue people escape alive save people make fast generators be great in the skill check new killers new survivors new peeeeeeeeeeerks and others things )) i realy love this game! oh yeaaaaaaah! it is so crazy and creepy this game is 10/10
1;i reccommend this game for its gameplay and quality of gameplay are very well done and presented to players easily.Multiple play styles are possibly (even if higher rank gameplay doesnt show it).Only real negatives have to be that the report system has no affect on its players.Final thoughts are that this game is definitely not a bad pick me up and try game.
1;"""Great multiplayer co op survival game but community has """"little"""" toxicity. Game has few issues and bugs.Some perks are so powerful that some people climb ranks just because of the perk not by being good.And when skill and those perks combine it's just disgustingly overpowered.But you know I'm HOOKED."""
1;This game is amazing! you can play with friends or you can play with random people. You can be the killer or be the one desperatly trying to survive! It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time! you can build your character and play different characers. You have several maps to play which is awesome! And the killer selection is to die for lol IF you have not played this game you are depriving yourself of a endless fun end of your seat experience. Get it now!
1;Dead by Daylight is honestly a really good game the only issue that I have with the game is its community. You will usually encounter some form of toxicity no matter what you play. If you have thick skin and laugh at people who rage at you then this game is for you!
1;Product received for free. Great game no game is the same because of the different killers and survivors! I would recommend this game to everyone who likes coop survival or to be a killer!Its a strategy game but you need some skills some perks and some balls to be a bait for the killer!Feedback Maybe add a voice chat for survivors and some games are lagged out by the terrible network of the host (the killer).
1;This game is alot of fun till you shut it down come back later and you have lost like hours of game play or any point gains you have made. With this as a issue that has over 4 days happened to me twice now. I cannot as a gamer recommend something that pisses me off so badly when it occurs.
1;This game is amazing! I love playing as both killer and survivor but I must say I find it even more fun to play with friends as a survivor. The community is mostly made up of good sportsman like people. You may run into the occasional griefing teamate or camping/tunneling killer but they are few and far between. I appreciate how the devs listen to the conserns of their community/fanbase. This game is some of the most fun I've had on a multiplayer only game and I can't stop playing D
1;The game may not be very balanced but I enjoy it a lot. I am a killer main(unfortunately because the game is survivor sided currently) and even though I always get flamed by survivor that I kill and threatened with a ban from them I just take all the salt in and I have no problems. It does have moments when you feel horrible because you have no ruin and survivors gen rush you but the game is addicting nevertheless.I'd give it 8/10.
1;Product received for free. GREAT if you are okay with everyone calling you a cheater or camper ( even if you put down a trap or bait as pig) after each match because people are SO salty in this game. BUT it is very fun and i enjoy it very much. great gameplay as survivor and being a killer is just satisfying. and to the people that hate me in game..... lol stop being mad.
1;Matchmaking and Balance have come a long way since '16I can recommend this game for people who want to get jump scaredalso if you are into constanly feeling worry and terror this'll be funBe advised these feelings only last about 100 hoursafter which you discover the games mechanicsthen you become a time managing wizard and ruin some poor kids day
1;One of the most fun games I've ever played. In total on this account and my other account I have 700 hours.It can be frustrating to play killer versus high ranked survivors but I find the challenge a part of the fun. When you purchase the game prepare to get your ss handed to you much like in your first MOBA. But you will have fun you will learn and you will git gud.
1;I have loved this game since it came out and played countless hours and when I can't play I watch streamers on twitch. Despite some bugs and imbalances here and there this game is full of thrills and the devs are constantly updating it. The DLC's and new maps are fun and fresh. While some games I stop playing over time I always find myself back on DBD &lt 3
1;Dwight is life please dont harm any dwight you see. If the entity wants something sacrifice that claudette look she is hiding in her natural habitat tall grass. Or look that Ace is running around the pallets go loop around and around to play the classic run around in circle all the time that brings you the pure happiness.
1;I love gameplay except when being hooked camped but the gameplay itself not problem Most of my hours in this game is waiting for game to load up if you can somehow fix that you are golden now dont be a and were cool you ll know when you are in the action of a move in this game believe me you ll know.
1;Dead By Daylight is well an interesting game... The devs are constantly releasing rushed updates that fix minot bugs but add even more major bugs. The matchmaking can be a complete mess but usually is pretty good. I would recommend this game but prepare for a lot of toxicity and salt. It's still fun tho )
1;After some initial doubts I have found this game to be quiet addicting. The game has a great atmosphere and never fails to give me adrenaline rushs while playing as survivor. The only negative things about this game are the sometimes long matchmaking times and this one bug where you get stuck in a tree and can't move at all.
1;While it may seem repetitive at first after getting the hang of DbD it keeps me entertained for hours on end. There's always a different way to play based on the perks available and playing it with friends is the most fun thing for me. My one wish is that some day there will be a single player mode. D
1;Hmm.. no need to talk about graphics and gameplay things..They are just great...everyone knows that...it will be even better with dedicated servers..What i want to say is that this game needs emotes for killers and the ability to chat with everyone in the game while in lobby..Everyone will know the feeling that u've been called a noob when u're just trying to focus on daily rituals...it's annoying
1;Highly suggested game this is super fun and would be better with more people it would be sad if this game died but their is still a lot of people who play it look up how many people play this game I think its better with friends cause you have no communacation what so ever in the middle of the game so me and my friends use discord
1;There are no words to describe this game. Well maybe a few Toxic Hillarious Chaotic and A blast to play with or without friends. High praises and I cannot believe how much the recent dlc's have been improving compared to some of the older ones.11/7 Highly Reccomend
1;This game may be really annoying and at times with all the bugs and the peer to peer connectionThe toxic survivors and killers and so onBut this game can be really fun especially with friendsMost matches are different from the last match even if you get a camper or somethingGame is amazing despite the flaws of it
1;I went into this game expecting not to like it. I thought it would be full of toxic people who sabatoage others and make it unenjoyable. I was very wrong. It's built so you really do need to play together to win. It lets you play as survivor or killer or both. There are tactics to learn tricks to discover and it gets your adrenaline going. No internal chat/voice while playing helps and doesnt kill the ambiance with toxic douches. Better than expected and has quickly become one of my fav games.
1;Really fun game to play with friends. When I bought it a year ago I didn't play it much. I had 10 hours in a year on the game. But now I have 110 hours in a month. Then I didn't play it with friends and now it's really fun with them. Sometimes there's toxic community but not that much. U can meet there a lot of new friends if u have not got any to play with.
1;Prepare your butt for the GREATEST SUFFERING that this world has known! Playing this astonishing game you will face an amazing community. You are welcomed in this residence of toxicity which contains lots of fun for every taste pallet looping gens rushing camping tunneling teammates getting you farmed AND MORE! bugs. These badasses are made to make you cry tears of blood. hours of your miserable life unnoticeably disappeared )10/10! This game literally makes me wet. Just play it!
1;Although it has it's fair ammount of glitches the game is fun to play especially with friends. The biggest downfall for the game has to be the toxic community surrounding it which really isn't a fault of the game. Would recommend especially if it were on sale.
1;This game is loads of fun to play. Both killer and survivor. As a survivor main I get plenty of thrills when getting chased. The game is even better with friends! If you want you can hop into a private match with friends and screw around. Or you could go into a game as survivors and play together. Overall if you're a thrill seeker like me or want a game to have fun with friends this is a great game to play.
1;Apart from its toxic community the pallet looping the non existant stealth game and under and overpowered perks as well as items and add ons its quite good.Don't take this game seriously and you'll have a blat take it seriously and you're going to rage every game.
1;"""I absolutely love this game. It has flaws it can be frustrating but it always leaves you with hope. If you get killed who cares? Start another session! If you can't kill anyone play another game! The developers are actually active and constantly improving and I love them for that. I am horrible at this game and keep coming back for more. So if you're the killer and see """"dweezler"""" is a survivor just be easy on me... P.S. Just play with MissLucyX on Twitch."""
1;Game is pretty good. Fun for quite awhile but can get annoying at rank 1 killer/survivor cause people will use lame shit to win. Lots of different stuff to use to change up gameplay but too much DLC and a on of stuff for new players to unlock. if you dont buy DLC pretty hard to get perks some of which are the best for killers. Survivors main perks you kinda have from default characters.
1;Product received for free. great game better than when it started i remember the double pallet loops that used to exist and i do miss them however i believe it benefits many people that it is removed and believe that the devs are doing the greta job really fun game.
1;How to win as survivor Step 1 Get 3 other people to play with you.Step 2 All be Dwight and use murky reagents or darkest moonlightStep 3 Join a GameStep 4 Immediately upon starting the trial all go into the basement lockers.Step 5 Get found by killer and mercilessly killed.Step 6 See that the killer was Rank 1. GG(Updated 12/8/2018) Good luck if you're new
1;I was scared and a little disappointed at first. I gave this a second chance and I am completely hooked. Get it? Its not without balance issues occasional bugs and salty survivors. However its a blast to play and very rewarding for the time I have put in. I love this game
1;A very Fun horror experience for both the Killer and Survivor. For Killer it's the fun and Thrill of the Hunt that makes them fun. For the Survivor it's the Resilience and the will to survive that makes playing them fun. The game is still a little buggy with it's vaults and pallets (and hit detection) but otherwise it really is a fun experience.
1;This is still one of the best asymmetrical horror games that I have played so far. The game has its fair share of bugs here and there but nothing serious. It never gets boring and has an amazing replayability value.Edit Still pretty amazing with all the new killers that keep getting added even though I have stopped playing.
1;Other than the sweaty killers facecamping and tunneling its pretty fun. eat me if you're one of those people btw. It's really fun with friends and even solo play don't expect to win every game though and the learning curve takes a while. Progression system is great and mildly rewarding. In my opinion though it needs rewards for getting to new rank levels. 9/10 would recommend.
1;I've just transfered to pc from ps4 (been playing since 2017 on the ps4) the free week made me do it. PC is much more smoother an overall better experience. And I even grabbed the deal which includes Dead by Daylight &amp The Saw DLC! For just 12 a great deal! This game is great would recommend! One of the few games that make me stick around.
1;I'm sorry did you want to try this game?Connection errorConnection errorConnection errorHaven't gotten a chance to even play on this free weekend.Past that free weekend tho this game has been great fun and I hope all the bugs I hear ppl complaining about are fixed before I run into them.. )
1;"""Did you ever play games of Hide and Seek at night?Do you like Horror movies?Ever wanted to kill a group of defenceless campers?Well this game takes all of those things and (boy I hate this phrase) """"puts you in the drivers seat.""""I suppose I should have asked """"Have you ever wanted to be a defenceless camper sacrifiesd my a maniac to dark Gods?"""" but that sounds bad.Play it. It's fun."""
1;This game is fun but there has a nasty bug that ruin your effort. The game itself has bad progress save system. I lost my save file after the last patch. Everythings gone bloodpoint levels perks all gone. Not just me but happen to a lot of other players too.Edit. The bug has been fix. Status effect some perks has changed to make game balance. I'm feel like the game is polished now and the price drop too. If you looking for a game to play with ye mateys I recommended this game.
1;My review Gameplay 3.5/5 It's good Graphic 4.5/5 It's good Story 2.5/5 because It's not excite Music 3.5/5 I agree this soundtrack it's horror like i'm stuck in ForrestSocial in Game 1/5 because it's not okay it's have toxic player leaver player (I hate it)I give this game 3/5because have a new bug and cheater and toxic playerBut when New Killer Have Come it's fun
1;Product received for free. All around fun and addicting game to play. But i've just recently encountered people in the higher ranks (1 2 3) that can on your pc. I killed a higher rank survivor and my pc instantly blue screened. Every time it restarted it blue screened again and again. Please find these people DBD and get rid of them. This almost costed me a whole new motherboard.
1;A fantasic game used to rage a lot but later learned to just have fun. Learn to accept the bugs and have fun with them killer or survivor. If you dont learn to do such things you will never have fun and just quit. I understand that killer is frustrating but aim for improving and not 4 kills each match will do more good than you think. Dont be afraid to say what annoys you but if everything annoys you then look for another game. If you like team based horror survivor games totally recommend DBD.
1;Best Horor multiplayer game I ever play. It is better than Friday the 13 . I want to see jason in dead by daylight is for me very powerful killer and I want to fix the Freedy Krugger. You must buy this game because is so fun to play with friends. Rate 10/10
1;I personally like this game but then I played this game for 75 hours so what do I really know.Tho I enjoy this game I recommend you try this game once or twice or atleast see some gameplay/reviews. I had a free trial when dbd was on sale and I really enjoyed it and made my mind about nuying the game (of course I was interested in the game way before it was on free trial).I recommend this game but it might not be for everyone (I mean don't we all have our preferences).
1;This game is addictive. With headphones you become fully immersed for a night of jump scares. The game provides you with a variety of surviors and killers which makes every game different from the last. The developers are always adding items charatcters and mechanics to keep the game fresh. Payed full price and don't regret it at all.
1;i love this game. in most horror games it's singleplayer and even when there is multiplayer in a horror game it's mostly only coop and the killer is just an AI but in this game you can be the killer or the survivor if ur survivor someone else is the killer so you have to play against real people i would really recomend this game if you like horror games it definetly is worth the money(or you buy it on a sale like i did)
1;Although it still requires a lot of work to patch Bugs and Hacks there is still a lot of potential behind this game even after the amount of years it's been out.The developers also work hard to continue working and improving upon the games features and faults and haven't given up.The game isn't perfect and it's nowhere near it either but still a hell of a lot of fun to play with Friends.
1;Very fun game on both sides killer and survivor The rounds are pretty short most of the time There is no in game communication so you don't need to put up with the salty community before the game ends Sure you still face balancing issues and sometimes pretty long queue times for matchmaking. However the developers still listen to the community and show this game some love. Most other studios would release a sequel game so thumbs up for that.
1;I love getting pallet looped gen rush getting stunned getting blinded while picking up a survivor scratch marks disappearing for some reason even though i just saw where the survivor ran entity displeased trying to get to rank 1 killer for 10 hours only to fail because i keep getting matched with god like survivors decisive strikeWould recommend this game for everyone &lt 3
1;Awesome game tho the matchmaking need improvements.Also would be nice to have more relevant stuff from the movies like the original Freddy's song with the creepy girls voice just for the survivor to hear. Would be very nice also if leatherface do the dance macabre with his special power. Same hitting points but if you look he is actually doing his iconic dance.
1;This game may induce the saltiest of people to become so full of rage that they take it out on innocents may have made me so mad that I HAVE to get off a game but I cannot deny the hard work the Devs put in. They face so much crap from the very community that both praise and despise the game try their hardest to get things right and appease the community it's hard not to love them. The game itself always has enough draw to keep me coming back especially when friends are playing.
1;It may be never bug free but the devs are always working on them. Its the best horror game currently available and features some well known characters from horror movies. The community is mostly nice and often fun. Totally worth its money. I has some great events too which make me wanna come back to this game again and again.
1;Hide and go seek + freeze tag. Most of the community are good people. It's difficult to understand how to win when you first start. Keep playing until you get the hang of it. Great to play with friends.Edit Still one of the most enjoyable games I own (as of Nov 2018). The team is constantly making this game better. Totally enjoy it.
1;Has had it's ups and downs for me but when you starting playing absolutely EVERY noise scares you and it's a really cool experience even more so with friends! You get to introduce people to the game and let them be the scared ones and you can all laugh and have a great time. Even when you've played for a long time you will still get the jump scares and that rush when you're being chased. I love it.
1;A really fun game that requires a lot of teamwork.Obviously a lot more fun to play with your friends but also great to play by yourself to try and get better at the game.Some things need more work though like the lobbies being P2P and you being dependant on the internet connection of the killer. Also the anti cheat system needs some more.Great game to play try and get it while on sale.
1;The game is good but after 100 hours of play you understand that in it as in any other community game is not so ordinary (toxic). Comterative is not interesting as they usually all go to the discord and break the gameplay for this they are camped and then in the chat we see complaints about maniacs. But the game takes the atmosphere and I hope that the game will be engaged in the right direction.
1;The start of the game can be a bit challenging for new players and progression is pretty slow until you've put a decent chunk of time into the game. Lag is pretty common and can ruin games. Players with a lot of time invested can be pretty toxic.Even with these problems it's still a fun game. The learning curve is steep but once you've gotten the hang of it it's a lot of fun.Playing with friends highly recommended especially for newer people.
1;I would recommend this game specially if you get it on sale. The game itself is fairly simple and easy to understand but hard to master. It pitches 4 survivors against 1 killer in a randomly picked map. Survivors try to escape and the killer does what a killer does. Pros Ability to outplay other people is fun and encouraging.Many hours of play for relative little moneyUpdated regularly.Cons Lack of a proper Ranking systemSlightly lacking polish on non gamebreaking issues.
1;hello everyone i have a question. i resently upgraded my computer and i love playing this game but have not been able to play this game eversense i can run anyonther game no problem but this one will not run over 15fps i have a radion rx 560 and it utilises 100% of my gpu for some reason is there anything that i can do to make this game work because i have the right sestyem requirements to run it but somthings wrong and i realy want to play the game agin.
1;Very fun to play with your friends! u also can chop chop ur frens without feeling guilty and being hated !!The scary atmosphere the thriller and the thriump feeling when u are the only one survived at the end of the game are the B E S T!Very happy to purchased this game i never regreted it one second!!!
1;It's a great game especially if your into survival horror. I wish there was a way to stop the killers from camping that's really the only problem. Thankfully not many people do it. You also get new chapters every 3 months as well as cosmetics worth it!
1;It can be highly addicting and there will inevitably be some good rounds that make you push for more sadly the community is rather toxic and childish. Either side will basically flame or insult the other for no reason except to either or brag depending if they felt they did well or if they feel they got unfairly taken out. Basically play for yourself or play with some buddies there will be salt hopefully it doesnt bother you much and ruin the experience.
1;"""a fun and good game to play with friends it have some isues along the gaming course but i think the devs will rezolv them in due time ) well keep it up boys and girls P and uhmm maybe you bring some new killers to the game """" there are a loot of kilers in the horror movie's you can think of """" xD"""
1;When I bought this game over a year ago I dropped it after a few hours of playing. It just didn't feel right.Well after a friend made me play it again I realized that it really got better. I can't quite nail down what changed but I really love this game now. As long as you can handle salt in certain situations give this game a shot. Especially great when surviving with friends!
1;hate the matchmaking system and killer finding a lobby can take up to 30 mins (my exp) when season resets all the pros and noobs mix so its a bit unfair and alot of ppl like to Tbag toxic stuff etc but its fun playing the game either killer or survivor
1;This game has taken over my life and ruined many relationships of mine. i come home from my 12 hour job and just come home to ignore my girlfriend so i can play. This game will boil your blood and make you want to throw your pc out the window. no matter how times my blood gets boiled i cant stop playing. i have bags under my eyes from how much i play this and still this game boils your blood to the max.
1;This game may be a little buggy at times (Getting Better) but in my opinion those don't matter because the pros of this game are way more abundant than the cons. Lastly I rate this game a 8.5/10.Pros Great concept not pay to win in a sense overall good graphics a lot of options from clothes items and characters and much more!Cons A bit laggy depending on where the host is compared to you and a little buggy here and there.
1;Been keeping this game on my watchlist and well it delivered.I had pre ordered the game 2 months (risky i know) prior to it's release with a great amount of hype for the game but i was also worrying if it'd be what i'd expected or not.Turns out it was better than i expected.Definitely worth your money!
1;How to have fun in Dead By Daylight1 Relax it's only a game.2 If you can't relax because your fellow survivors are inept at surviving go Killer to shiv them.3 If you can't relax because survivors are being toxic and teabagging or looping you then go survivor to let of some steam.4 Repeat 'till you give up due to frustration 5 Jump back on tomorrow 'cause it's fun and addictive and you like the thrill of the hunt.6 Eventually vow to never play again.7 Play again8 Start steps 1 7 all over again.
1;After I spent 400 hours in this game with all the bugs and this toxic community I can just recommend this game it's awesome especially with friends but you're gonna rage sometimes. I don't really play Dbd anymore but I'm glad to see this game is still alive and even grows further. I have a lot of good memories with this game and I even met new people and made friends. I'm sure one day I will look at this game feeling nostalgia.
1;THIS GAME IS AWESOME. I highly recommend this game. If you're playing as survivor Just sacrifice help each other. If you're playing as Killer Learn strategy Chasing Hanging. Don't let your ego controls you this game not about win or lose. MAKING SCORE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT.Don't be emotional this is just a game. Just enjoy it. Cheers D
1;You'll both love and hate this game its filled with BS that can make it stressful but it also has so many good things to keep you engaged if I had to recommend some of the DLCs i'd say get the halloween chapter leatherface and either curtain call or of flesh and mud the others arent really that necesary unless you want to play as the killers or survivors of each or need a specific perk from them.p.d. be prepared for salt in extreme quantities
1;One of the best games to play with your friends one of the worst to play by yourself. The overwhelming majority of the playerbase is mentally challenged toxic af overtly selfish arrogant stubborn straight up delusional. Easily the worst community out of any game I've ever played. Also the amount of bugs this game has is overwhelming at times. Addicting af so that's why I'm still playing.
1;"""""""Dead By Daylight"""" is definitely one of the best games I've ever played but it'll never be better than the Zelda games 3 At first I had some lagg problems then I figured out that if you change the graphic settings to low then the game works much more lagg free and the graphic settings difference isn't that big of a deal. It's also thrilling like EVERY time I play it I get jump scared and startled."""
1;Product received for free. This game is one of my favorites and will more than likely always will be (until it ends up dying in the future). Although it can get repetitive it's one of those games where if you like it you'll stick around with it. It's important to understand that you will be terrible at the game at first but after some practice you will gradually get better and increase in rank. Community can get toxic at times but you just gotta lift your chin and not give af. Best of luck!
1;Very beautiful game but every time there is an update it becomes harder. I think the developers trying to satisfy the killer only to play the game and don't think about survivors. Also there are no mods like other games. other games change a little bit every period and they add more things. For example create a mod in kill your friend that let 5 survivors join the game but change the number of perks and gens. Or try 2 killers and 6 8 survivors xD of course this an example.
1;this game is super fun from runing for your life to mowing down people with a chain saw. but it has problems that the game has really hinders it its hard for new people to get into to game. hard loops can really put a dent in you fun. and trying to win agents a SWF group is like pulling off a finger nail.I give the game a 8.5/10 if the devs fis the problems with the game that will be a 9.5/102018 05 21
1;Pretty fun with a good group of freinds but i think adding more new and unique content could help a bit. Having one gamemode can make the game a little stale from time to time. If you have a reliable group of friends to get this with then def pick it up but if not maybe just wait until it goes on sale then snatch it.
1;Once you learn how to play the game and get some good friends to play with this game is really fun. I have been playing this game non stop for weeks and am not even close to bored. I highly reccomend this game and for the current price it is a major steal.
1;This game is very fun to play with friends. Dead by Daylight is plagued with some balance issues (it's an asymetrical PvP game after all) but the developers are constantly updating the game with new content and balancing. I'd recommend it.But please for the sake of your team watch the tutorials.
1;"""Everything about this game is solid except for the """"strategies"""" in this game are very questionable. Having the Devs comfirm camping and slugging a validative strategy is comeplete BS. Just having a normal day then 5 games in a row where you get face camped of slugged. Its fun but until that happens its not. But then you learn how to be toxic and all is fine."""
1;Great game. Feels heavily unbalanced when you first start playing but becomes a true addiction after you get a handle on things. This is not a game you can learn by watching videos and streams. The more experience you get the better you will become. Absolutely engaging and enjoyable gameplay. Especially when you go it alone and try to be a solo survivor. Makes the game what it really is meant to be a horror film experience.
1;While far from perfect this game is really addictive for fans of slasher movies as it gives a good immersion and some really tense and stressfull play sessions. I howerver must warn that the learning curve is steep and whatever side you will choose your opponent will be merciless.
1;A really fun game. Either play as a nigh unstoppable killer or team up with other player to try survive. People say that the game is fairly killer sided at the moment but in a game where teh killer is suppose to be powerful I feel like it is more balanced than it has been since the game started.
1;Great game very active devs who have really brought in some amazing improvements since they bought the rights to the game.There is a constant stream of new content including new skins maps and characters which keep things fresh and interesting.There are regular news updates keeping the community posted on game developments.Balance is getting better and better too moving away from where it was over the last year with a total bias towards the survivor.Strongly reccomend.
1;It's like a love and hate relationship D the game is fun especially as SWF 3 but then again some Bugs make you hate the game for a moment or if you get camped even tho the killer dont get any emblem points for it anymore i recommend it anyways tho since its alot of fun
1;I've been playing this game now for around 30 hours and I have to say it's a great game! I've always been a fan of horror movies etc so this is the perfect game. Sometimes the lobby is kinda messed up but I don't really care. I have a lot of fun playing it as survivor with friends and I guess I'll play it a lot more!!EDIT after some more hours I also started playing as killer! it's actually pretty funny when you get the hang of it! sadly you often have to wait 10 15min to find a lobby...
1;Sneaking around evading killers repairing generators with other survivors to escape... Sure there may be a lot of toxicity in the community and it's not glitch free but there's something about this game that brings me back constantly. The developers while not perfect are always adding new content and doing a pretty decent job updating the game.
1;You should definitely get this game. It literally took me less than three days to completely understand all the perks and grasp the concept of this game and it took me a long time to master it but it was definitely a balanced and fun experience that they have provided for new players. Get it no regrets.
1;Dead by Daylight is a very addictive classic horror game where 4 players have to try to scape from a killer who's also a player. You can upgrade your player and make it better with new skills to avoid being captured or helping the others. For me is a very good game to play with friends. A lot of fun guaranteed!!I definely love this game
1;Amazing game the grapichs are pretty good and the community is awesome.There might be some toxic killers that face camp but you and your friends will defidentally find something out.Its very fun to play by yourself. But Playing with friends are even better!
1;This game is good but if you like killer gameplay don't bother if you have a bad connection. People will just go crazy in end game chat. All in all this game still needs lot of stuff rewards for ranking seasons dedicated servers (announced for 2019 we'll change review then).If you're a hardcore slasher movies fan this is your graal.

1;For me who has put over 450 hours into this game I can thouroughly say I have enjoyed it and can highly recommend it. This game is fun and exciting and will get your blood pumping whether you are getting chased by the killer performing a risky rescue or are the last survivor standing. Highly recommended. DEdit Still playing this game loving all the new DLC's they keep making for this game! Pretty good job so far keep up the good work! c
1;I really believe the dlc prices need ajustment. 7 dollars for a character and a map local is dumb. i can expect 3 to 5 dollars but 20 for one is getting ourtragous. and now that new killers are coming its making it more of an advantage toward the new killers and not the survivors
1;Absolutely love this game it's a great game and I enjoy it but after you play it for around 1 3 months you start to feel bored and sick of playing it you will find that its the same thing on and on and on because theres only 2 gamemodes. the devs should add more gamemodes. But overall its a very cool game.
1;Dead By Daylight is one of those kind of games that you hate and keep saying i wont play this again but you still come back for more of it.Its a fun game to play with freinds in (SWF) Survive with friends og in (KLF) Kill Your FriendsYou can get a lot of hours well spent in DBD
1;This game is great and has loads of maps and characters. if you like games that you can choose this game is for you it is a horror and i love horror games you have to fix 4 gens and the killer kills 4 survivors. I hope you have fun in the game and i really enjoyed it.
1;"""MAN. This game be ing scary as ing addicting as hell but these ing killers are annoying as Get me on the hook aight? BUT DON'T ING MAKE ANNOYING SOUNDS WHEN CATCHING ME JUST FOR A QUICK """"In your face!"""" Moment. Good game. 10/10. Though I'd prefer cocaine."""
1;Watch as your faith in humanity disolves. Your a good killer? We'll troll you! You want to play a decent game? Nah man I'll facecamp you till you die! Trying to be a recpectable killer? Dude were just guna use infinites troll and call you a camper after! 10/10 would rage again.
1;Really fun game to play as you carry your fat es off hooks or play alone and murder fools in dark forests. Constant patches and fixes improve the game not to mention the content updates with dank skins for survivors and killers. Totally recommend this game.
1;Intense fun and addictingGreat game Toxic community annoying devMaking a lobby as a killer almost takes an hour and sometimes get bullied by the survivor with flashlight and suchjoining lobby as a survivor kinda sucks sometime since i always get a lobby with 800+ ping and lagswitcherAnd Pretty good job so far
1;I have pretty much grown older with this game.You can either take this game as fun or as frustrating you can t say the others do it. I had fun a lot more times than i was frustrated. Although developers may not be the most beloved bunch they keep trying to make the game fun for everyone. And i hope it keeps on being amazing even in the future
1;This game is pretty good fun on both sides but not always. I usually always play the killer and most of the time it's easy and fun but for me being a survivor is hard maybe because I'm at being one or the game is unbalanced but overall this game is pretty good and a few DLCs are worth buying.
1;Right now it s to buggy Worst of all there is no matchmakin/queueing &amp if you find sth the killer leaves...game has potential but is not worth 20 buck at the moment /_________________Update 22.11.18 Still has some bugs but it is a fun game to playcon to unluck full content you need to buy the dlcs in general toxic community
1;Really good game. The only thing I have to say is that there are currenlty some notification bugs. When you are Killer the game is not showing you what gen was completed &amp not being able to see where the doors are. This only happens in some games usually every 4 5 games in. Other than that the game is really good. The community not so much. Many Entitled Survivors &amp Killers not a lot of people get along but there are some games where you do.
1;Great game.Nice graphics cool concept haunting music and a lot of fun with friends. Playing alone is rather boring as survivor but as killer one has a lot of fun. The price is fair. Would prefer better support and service for reports and maybe a feedback.
1;Been playing this game for about 2 years the updates in the last year and the devs buying the rights from the publishers have really made this game a lot more fun an enjoyable. 4v1 asymmetric horror gameplay has never been as enjoyable. Definitely recommend especially if you like Horror!
1;I got this game from my son for Christmas. Had no idea i would be addicted in a day . The game is action packed makes me scream leaves me wanting to play more after each round. It may be repeating over and over the same actions but it so fun to see the out come of each match. would highly recomend this game.
1;After gettin' rank 1 i have done my biggest achievement in the game... so i am no longer playing it until new matchmaking system comes out cuse it tase so long to get in actual game. Overall the game is cool and lovely but some people like ochido and toxic stuff make community wasted BTW toxicness doesn't work with me (i become even more toxic if someone being toxic in my lobby so...).
1;Dead by Daylight is a game that captured and ensared me the moment I got through my first game. It's a unique beautiful and well thought of game that honestly has a pretty bad reputation.This game as a lot of potential to become amazing and I can't wait to see where it goes.
1;Aside from having a community where a decent chunk of players will find anything to harass you about the game in itself is greatm and the developers (from my casual gamer eyes at least) are doing well in getting new content out and trying to balance it as well as possible. Highly recommended as I've yet to play a game like it the atmosphere the tidbits of lore and the mix of original and well known characters are a few of it's great aspects.
1;You're a fan of horror? You like mindgames? You like salt? Here's THE game you need my friend! Play agaisnt a bunch of people or with a bunch of people to ruin another person's day. No but seriously this game is really cool play well and is pretty addictive when you begin to really try your best.
1;Two of us left I am injured Using the bond perk notice that the other teammate is hiding in a closet by the hatch Teammate is waiting for me to die so he can escape Spam the enter closet button hoping killer sees Killer knocks me out Killer opens closet and takes guy out Killer hangs guy on hook Guy dies I start spinning in circles on the floor Killer picks me up Killer carries me to hatch I escaped
1;Is is balanced? Heck no! Are people generally stupid enough on the opposing team for you to win anyway? Yeah. Is winnign against brain dead noobs fun? Kinda. If you don't feel bad about bullying the very dullest knives in the drawer this is the game for you.
1;Honetly this game is great. It really is especially if you're a fan of horror movies or creepypastas. Playing as survivor has this certain thrill of running away from something you truly fear (unless its freddy krueger ironically) and playing as the killer grants you the satisfaction of hunting. The game is constantly adding new characters and maps and the community can be a fun toxic happy place for horrorcore fans.
1;I really love this game!... but i'm so that people are take me of the hook in front of the killer and farm points that way! seriously. you can't do about it... at lest make it so you can choose to get ''take off'' or not. hold shift or something like when you dont want to get healed! its not that hard!because this is t! developer! i played you game some much... please make this for me!
1;(Pretty good job so far)In all seriousness this game does have it's flaws but the flaws are pretty much a part of the charm of this game and the game is great fun. Had some of the most fun times just playing this even when fighting with friends in matches.
1;Does all the gens hooks saves everyone opens up gates heals people destroys totems teamates hide in a closet you get downed you get put on a hook your teamates leave you and say thx for carry &lt 3tbh this game is but I still like itps. PLAY WITH FRIENDS (but i dont have any so)
1;Regardless of the hate DBD gets its honestly a great game. Don't let the reviews change your mind if you're thinking of buying it. It's an asymmetrical horror if you feel the game is unbalanced IT ISThe devs do an awesome job at listening to and including the community and they are constantly putting new content into this game and trying to iron out imperfections.
1;Great game with unique 1v4 mechanic. If you are a beginner and playing as survivor dont be dissappointent if you are getting killed or dont make it out alive in your first few rounds. It takes awhile to get familiar with the whole game setup like in every PvP game. In case you are struggling against the killers i recommend to play 2 or 3 rounds AS killer to recognize what the killerpart is able to do so and especially what hurts him.So dont be mad just hit that play again!
1;+ Satisfying level progression. Some fun gameplay elements (chases jukes). Really fun with friends. Toxic Community. Questionable gameplay mechanics (camping crutch perks). Devs that keeps changing their ideas for this game.At this price this game is worth it.
1;It's awesome that players can play either as a survivor or as a killer. Made my heart beat faster nicely with the soundtrack too. The fact that i'm running from a killer that isn't NPC is much more exciting and vice versa. Though the game does increase the saltiness of a person. Be it a random or yourself i recommend preparing some popcorns when playing this. )
1;I absolutly love this game. It is great for playing with friends but also gives the same experience while playing alone also. Everybody can have there own experience thorugh the wide variety of characters to choose from and show style with the many customizations provided.
1;"""Playing survivor is really fun if you have at least one friend to play with while killer allows for a kind of """"single player"""" experience. There's no dedicated servers which means you won't have to deal with outages but also comes with the issue of connecting to some asshound in central Turkmenistan decided the play killer and you don't notice your ping of 3 million until the game starts.I would happily frick 3 of the killers you figure out which ones"""
1;Fixed the matchmaking and the issues with the dropped off from the lobby.The ping of the room/server can also be viewed from the lobby. Hope thay fix more network connection issues and create a dedicated server for players. Game is slowly improving Good Job Starbreeze Studios!
1;"""Different experience as survivor / killer.You get the occasional player being salty because you don't play the """"way you're supposed to """" which usually means not giving them every advantage as survivor if you're killer or making the killer chase you for too long. But it's fun especially with friends."""
1;Pros Can easily play a ton of hours Every match plays a bit differently Good varietry of killers Lots of perks to customize your playstyleCons Higher ranks have long queues Players can be toxic sometimes Devs are either slow or dont care to fix many core gameplay issues Overall worth it since the game is constantly updated devs like to communicate with the players about their progress on the game
1;I like this game too mutch but the only think I dont like are the killers who are campers... campers are very needless and they give a lot tryhard ' ' (but how we know in all games there are these things).So its fine (for me) I have fun inthe same way and with friends its better 3
1;"""Challenging game for starters prepare to invest time. The learning curve can be quite high. More fun with friends via voice com. Can be frustrating at times for solo players due to obvious advantages in survival with friends. Advise play both killer and survivor it will help your ability to play """"good"""" a lot."""
1;Great game. One of my most played ones. Did have serious issues with it crashing constantly on me (to do with the game engine they use) but after reinstalling my graphics card drivers from scratch and then fiddling with some settings on it I seem to have mailed the problem (I hated that it looked like I was Dcing when the game was crashing on me)
1;updated review ) after playing a fair few more hours on this game i have to say i love to play it i often play solo in groups with random survs but have played with friends both are fun you do need to put hours into the game to get better and unlock perks playing killer is also alot of fun when it comes to dwights XD they deffo love lockers just make sure you keep a eye out for the hiding claudettes x great game loads of fun
1;In this game you can Run in circles Be considered toxic for doing objective Feel like you are in an abusive relationship Stare in the beautiful eyes of Bubba for what feels like eternity Lose some additional hope as your teammates spend their time crouching from locker to locker Mindgame yourself beacuse you have 200 IQ Run in circles a little bit more
1;This game is funny only if u play killer or at lower ranks (between 20 and 10). Survivors are really crappy due to multiple nerfs and unfixed bugs. Tunneling and camping are real issues which make the game really unfun for survivor.But i recommand it since they added Michael Myers &lt 3
1;Even though this game can be a bit buggy at times I can tell the developers try their hardest with this game and trying to keep their community always interested in this game with new content this being one of my first games of these types I really enjoy playing this game for the most part.
1;Dead by Daylight has come a long way since its release. New killers and survivors continue to be added with more on the roadmap ahead. Game balance continues to be dialed in and tweaked generally for the better. The early days were far from balanced and I'm glad I gave the game another shot. There are still some trolly try hards and survive with friends still provides a distinct advantage but its still enjoyable more often than not.
1;so far i love this game i dont have too many hours but i got enough but as of right now i cant even get past the loading screen at the very beginning all it says and stays saying installation complete and stays that way no matter what i do. Please do need a patch or somethign to be able to keep playing. Love the game do play
1;Fun game. The toxic is abit boring but if you have played CoD or LoL you are bulletproof. The toxic as many complains about can't be compaired haha. So far im having a blast. SWF is really fun (getting camped or tunneled is annoying) but otherwise I recommend this game!
1;I absolutely love this game. It is so much fun and with all of the random people playing it adds a nice element of suprise. It is even more fun to play as a group of friends and troll the killer or even to kill your friends. The onlyt warning I have is to not take the game seriously. Too many people do this especially at high ranks. This just leads to saltiness and an unenjoyable game. Otherwise I highly recomend this game to anyone.
1;This is a very fun game but it can be very frustrating when toxic people are in your game. the community is quite good. the game is still developping and growing of course there some bugs but they are still working on those things. I really recommand this game its easy to play but can be very hard to master!
1;The Devs have finally taken steps toward balancing the game properly. The game always has some new game breaking bug whenever a major update releases but you stay anyway. This game is an abusive relationship that you just can't bring yourself to leave.
1;Whether you love getting camped looped around or just love horror games this game is just for you. Terrible community facecampers tunnelers never ending loops and others.But! The game itself is a masterpiece. Never played a more exiting one.Buy. This.
1;A really addictive game! Developers make new content every season and they work really hard to balance the game and hear out the community.The down side is this community can be down right toxic. But I met a lot of friends here that I'm happy to keep. There is still some bugs and stuff but that's what gives content to montages on YT and they are great! Recommend you to watch them too.8.5/10
1;Gonna play killer? Hope you're ready to be tea bagged at every window and blinded everytime you pick someone up then flamed for camping even though you never hooked someone. Not your style? Try survivor! An exciting round of the killer finding you within 3 femtoseconds and hooking you to face camp you until dead while your team runs in circles doing jack 10/10 would recomend.
1;i for real thought this game was going to be big but after they added the new killer i wanna kms cuz that b fast asf so please nerf before i do it and add guns to the game cuz survivors need at least something to defend with with a lot of love carlos &lt 3
1;Dead by Daylight is a cancers pile of 85% of the time you get some russain streaming tryhard who slugs camps tunnels and just in general is really sweaty can't even have fun. Playing as killer is way more fun cause you can be the nice guy or if you like being a you can do that too i guess. anyway overall great game don't waste your money on it go play with your wiener instead oh it also suck sweaty testicels
1;Love the game. Even with the toxic community unbalanced killers/survivors perks and bugs. Love the fact that Developers listen to their Community and do their best to balance the game. A lot of players complain about this but keep in mid that it requires a lot to fix some issues and even more with balancing both sides. Still like i mentioned I LOVE THE GAME!
1;Final review.This game is a good experience for those with friends that enjoy competitive games. It is good solo but less so. Highly recommend getting a friend or more to play this with unless you plan to painfully learn to play killer. Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Replayability 8/10
1;really fun game would definitely recommend it it can be tilting to play sometimes but the concept is outstanding there is some glitches but its not tthat bad the upgrade system is so unique and the perks are also great. there is also constant updates and events so it almost never gets old. tho its a bit annoying that you need to buy dlc's to get some of the killers and survivors but its not a must to have all the dlc's.
1;Product received for free. Very fun game as long as the killer plays fair and teamates actually help you and work together. Sometimes killers camp and or use lag switch and it can be very annoying and teamates sometimes dont care about saving you as long as they escape but overall the game is really fun has cool perks and characters featuring some licensed killers like Michael myers and freddy Kruger and possibly more in the future. I love this game and met some really good friends on here.
1;This game has come a long way. It still has its bugs a flaws here and there but the devs have really stepped their game up with this dlc and the balancing. I can say without a doubt that this game is a lot better than it used to be. Im excited to see what comes in the future and how they move the game forward.
1;I think it has alot of bugs and glitches that are pretty annoying to play with.There are also a very nice system with perks bloodpoints offerings items and add ons that is very unique.i would happily reccomend this to anyone who has any sort of patience because this is a game where you grind (ALOT)
1;After 400 hours of playing this game i still find joy in it whether I play it alone of with friends. Not to mention the fact that the developers of this game are still pumping out content and probably will continue to do so Makes this game a worthwhile investment.This review is mainly written out of perspective of a survivor player I do not play killer at all so I can't testify for the enjoyment of playing that role
1;I got this game a while ago and it's really great to see how it has grown.To be honest a few years ago it started getting boring. However that is not to say that happens now. The devs are doing a great job at making the game fun and enjoyable for everyone and with new killers and survivors every couple of months the game stays fresh and exciting.I would very much recommend this to people.
1;Great game plenty of variety in playstyles and perks which keep the game fresh and interesting. Although the community at times can be annoying and the servers laggy the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.Just make sure not to take toxic words to heart and keep in mind that at the end of the day it really is just a game and you have plenty of fun!
1;This is my favourite game ive ever played i started playing during when it first came out on xbox.but i first saw it the week it came out and instantly loved it watched for 2 years wanting it finally got it and i loved it!best game i have ever played there are bugs and game mechanics that need to be fixed but i think its sill amazing.
1;i absolutely love Dead by Daylight... its fun to play with freinds or randoms but there is 1 thing that ive been wondering if anyones had the same problem... sometimes when I try to enter a lobby as a survivor it will jusk keep the loading... you cant exit out of the game or cancel finding a lobby. If so please comment if you've heard or seen anything about this glitch.
1;Product received for free. As someone who isnt a big lover of horror games this is a pleasent surprise!Super simple in terms of game play...Fix generators dont die escape!Gives you a nice little adrenaline boost when you're opening a gate too.Would recommend D
1;"""If you like horror type games but were curious about how both sides of the coin were this game might be for you. Super fun for solo play as the killer or 4 player group play as survivors. Both sides require quick thinking and it constantly keeps you on your toes. The only slight downside is that survivors can all be grouped up in """"survive with friends"""". For new killers it can be hard to fight against people who are able to talk with one another(there is no voice chat in game)."""
1;Dead by Daylight is a fun game and all but the amount of bugs and imbalances in the game sometimes ruins the DBD Experience... Not to mention that they dont have dedicated servers until 2019. But despite of all that its still fun I recommend you get it...
1;As a killer this games great just faceroll your way to victory fun but a little too easymode for me. Great if your a psychopath / sociopath irl?As a survivor however hard mode sets in and things start getting fun the cooperative aspects of this role are great espescially if you enjoy helping or rescuing others from iminent death.
1;Dead by Daylight is best survivor horror game and i like this game so much because of great graphics awesome sound effects and different types of killers survivors and maps. Anyone who wants to play survival horror game you can go for Dead by Daylight.
1;It is really funny but at the same time sometimes really frustrating when you can't escape from a killer. Some killers really aren't funny to play against or even the people behind the characters are sometimes really just toxic.Overall I love it thou and love playing it.
1;It's a pretty decent game with friends you can have some great moments yeah its frustrating to master but thats what makes it fun theres no rush to be good and i think its a great game with friends alone may be more tough but in the end its worth its money
1;Common salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl) a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts salt in its natural form as a crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite. Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater where it is the main mineral constituent the open ocean has about 35 grams (1.2 oz.) of solids per liter a salinity of 3.5%. Salt is essential for animal life and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes.
1;One of the best games I have ever played.The best part of it is you can either be the popular kid and play with your friends mess around or you can slaughter everyone as a killer and still have fun.This game balances the fun when your lonely or when you are social.
1;Pretty good job so far. Kappa. In all seriousness this game is fun. Despite it's bugs none of them are gamebreaking and its stupid funny 90% of the time especially with the current bug of sliding around almost t posing after throwing a pallet. Def more fun with someone though.
1;first of all the game music is awesome. i give 2 thumbs up for the music.game mechanic and gameplay somehow is fun both the survivor and killer with the simplicity of GUI and gameplay mechanic.lack of multiplayer playability and often need to close the game by force maybe will be solved on early 2019 by dedicated server.its worthed the price.
1;A game where you can sate your daily horror needs and test your resolve to toxicity. If you are a fan of horror games and want to become immune to toxicity then this game is for you. The devs did a pretty good job so far after all.EDIT Also as a con you WILL be bullied for trying out new things. Train with your sanity and saltiness under control and prepare yourselves for players who have admirable skills but despicable attitudes.
1;Lobby jumping simulator 2016 10/10EDIT The game now has the option to play with friends as survivor but is so unbalanced that is annoying to play... You enter the lobby with all your lvl 10 friends and the killer is lvl 50 with all rare perks. Unfair br&gt EDIT The game is more playable now but some random crashes still occurEDIT This is the only game I ever seen that have 2 lobbies before the game these devs doesn't know what they are doing
1;I knew this game from watching 2Bro. Entertainment's Dead by Daylight gameplays and they got me hooked. I'm glad that dedicated servers are coming up soon this year because the matching system isn't really good now. People disconnecting left and right from high ping or sudden lagness in game really ruins the match. Overall this game is most fun when surviving with friends but it's also fun surviving with randoms (provided they are not toxic).
1;Love this game Literally play it everyday and just fun and unique in my opinion. For sure check out videos of it / twitch and see if you like it! But i can say for myself i've gotten multiply people into the game! Plus it always goes on sale for $10 and totally is worth it!
1;it is a nice game but players are tryhards 90% being camped or friends who ignores you so the game not worth playing bcz of the players themselfs but if you want to play with your friends it will be so fun (bcz if u teamwork u can somehow deal with it)so if you have friends who will play with you then this game is so goodotherwise don't u will be facing tryhards and no teamwork team ( there is no voice chat )have a nice day
1;good game I love playing it.the gameplay is awesome and a very pleasant game in general. The game is fun to play and simple so you'll get the hang of it in a while. There is a bunch of characters to choose from and when you think the character starts to be a high level you can just start a new one. )
1;Figured it was time to review after all the free weekend reviews. The game is AMAZING. Both killer and survivor have a steep learning curve. If you can't handle winning every game this isn't for you. I say that as a survivor main who has reached rank 1 and I do not win every time by any means A LOT of losing happened along the way. I can see how it isn't for everyone try it and see for yourself.
1;THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC AND I AM VERY EXCITED FOR NEW THINGS TO COME KILLERS MAPS AND SURVIVERS 10000000000000% RECOMMENDED BROOOO THIS IS SUCH A GREAT GAME FELL DONE DEVS WELLDONE.. ANYWAYs THANKS FOR READING I BET NO ONES GONNA READ THIS BUT WHO CARES OK BYEEE!!! ... BUY THE FREAKIN GAME!!!!! (WHISPERED)
1;"""Fantasic game! I have around 150 hrs atm and I see many more coming soon! It's fun solo or with friends. Community can be slightly toxic and there are hidden """"rules"""" that if you break you may get flamed in chat. Play to have fun and you're guaranteed to have it!Dedicated servers are announced for Summer 2019 so It's be even better then."""
1;Its a fun game to play with friends the graphics are great and the game is intense. It might be a bit hard in the beggining but once you learn some tricks and get the right perks the game can be extremely funny with a lot of fails or awsome momments. I have had this game for a long time and can easily say it is only getting better with more dlc and way fewer bugs than it used to have.
1;"""Incredibly fun game to play whether you like chasing and hunting down survivors or you live by the code of """"No man gets left behind"""". Great game for teamwork and strategy each killer with their various perks implements new and different survivor strategies that change how you play and approach each round. Dwight's my main him and his sexy trackies and socks. Damn.11/10 would always play again.Some would say it's a pretty good job so far! D"""
1;I was hesistant to get this game at first because I couldn't quite understand what makes it so popular. Tried it for the first time on a free weekend and instantly fell in love. The game really captures the essence of being a hopeless survivor (when playing alone) or a brutal killer. Each killer has variety and a unique identity that defines them. Overall this game is engaging and addicting even if the community can be toxic at times.
1;it's really good to play with friends and this game make you feel adrenalin all time ) ... look at the killers .. love it but the cons .. camping killers can ruin the experience and some teammates can farm of you while leaving you stranded to die ... erww .. nothing is perfect )
1;Dead by Daylight is not a game about a killer hunting survivors. It is a zoo keeper sim. You can play an angry zoo keeper or one of 4 monkeys trying to destroy all the zoo equipment. The protagonists of the game are the killers. The horrible antagonists are the survivors.Rules of the zoo Use DS or abuse a lightsabre and the zoo keeper will stay at your monkey cage to make sure you dont escape the zoo.
1;This game is considered a horror game but not because the game is scary...It's because the community is so f***ing toxic its horrendous.Still its addictive and its fun and I wouldn't change it for anything....Game is super tilted towards killers tho. Survivors have it rough.
1;Yes Yes Yes.Dbd is an awesome game. Yet there are so many things wrong with it. Dbd is like the sexy hot girlfriend who you love to but everything else in the relationship drives you bat crazy. Weird analogy but if you've taken the time to really stick your fingers into Dbd you'll understand what i mean.Great party game with friends Or a great way to blow off some steam playing as a killer.
1;Has good and bad parts but mostly good. The problems lie in the player base and can only be fixed with better people playing. If you are a person who gets mad at games easily then this is not a game for you. If you are a person looking for a fun hide and seek game then I whole heartedly recomend it.
1;Product received for free. People say its a budget Friday the 13th it isnt its very adrenaline boosting and there are no jumpscares for jumpy and scaredy people like me. There is a heartbeat when the killer is near you but only rarely can you not hear it you hear music when the killer is near you and will NOT get jumpscared. Playing as a killer is really fun and overall I think this game is worth it
1;The community is toxic but the game is very addictive. Play as your favourite killer or survivor! There is even famous killers like Michael Myers Freddy Krueger and the pig from saw. New characters and outfits are released quite often. I LOVE THIS GAME JUST BUY IT!!!
1;"""This game is physically frustrating. The amount of RNG and just BS that happens in this game is absurd.You see the mechanics and you can feel a progression of play but it being left as a """"party game"""" such as mario party with random unfun elements makes the game very """"toxic.""""Still I continue to come back to this game for the Killers they have and the chases and games that are good. It is a lot of fun to play but you do definitely need to take a break or your hair will fall out."""
1;DbD is one of the best gaming surprises I've ever had. Not because I didn't know about the game but because I've been dismissing it for the past 2 years thinking it wasn't for me.After playing the Free weekend for almost 30 hours I immediatly got the Halloween ed. and Leatherface.Now I'm obsessed with a game I never thought I would enjoy.
1;I dont'like when we have to pay for the extra DLC content where these guys have an upper hand and we all F**king die.I was about to buy this game as i really liked the game in the free weakend. But when I saw this DLC should be paid instead of working ur way up. I turned down Good Bye.Updated But I still Like this game its being refined now
1;Really fun game. though there's one thing I'd like to add. If you are looking for a game to play with your friends this one's for you just beware of the toxicity of some of the people in the game. The community can get a little toxic but the majority of them are nice fun people.
1;so i have had this game for over a year now (700 hours at time of review) and honestly the game is far from perfect but i love this game they add new characters alot and while some of the community is toxic its overall a fun time. there are some scummy players for sure but honestly thats with any game thats online so nothing new here. killer is really fun when you start but after a while it becomes running in circle simulator which you will understand after playing for a bit. 7/10 for sure
1;This is a really fun game to play with friends or by yourself i still get scared when the heart rate increases knowing that the killer is lurking waiting for me. I think most people who enjoy horror games or movies will enjoy this watch some gameplay videos first to see if it's the kind of game for you.
1;I LOVE dead by daylight. It is a fun game to salt around in or be serious. Yes there are bugs yes there are salty and toxic players yes there is terrible customer service. But you know what? That's what makes the dead by daylight community so special. But if you can't tolerate it then uninstall and complain in the reviews see how much I care about your problems.
1;good game but If Devs see (doubt it) I would like to say a few things Firstly the Pig either needs a buff or to be removed and to others if versing The nightmare (Freddy kruger) dont try to escape as he is o.p and needs a nerf because there is no way to escape him other than brute force teaming him.
1;Fairly new to the game but enjoying it immensly. Diverse roster of killers keeps the game fresh and the leveling isn't too harsh making perk unlocks not too grind like. There are a lot of characters within both Survivors and Killers to level so still plenty of work to put into the game though.
1;this game is like drinking glass. yeah it hurts like hell and why the hell would you eat glass like youre the grinch? HOWEVER call me and my friends the grinch because we come back to this game every single day for more tilt. i hope it continues to add juicy content because thats whats keeping players around. (
1;The Game is really entertaining &amp addictive even the game is repetitive and low on mechanics!Anyway I wish the DEVS add more spice to the game like finding parts changing the view of survivor game modes and Survivor have a unique skills/traits balancing of the game and etc...The Game has a lot of Potentials D but lack of gameplay contents!
1;Pretty good job my br&gt You do all gensThe killer is on you the whole game while teammates crouching in cornersThe doors are open and they just wait in the gates for the killer while you're on a hookToxic people.. But I'm still playing it.. Why? helpmeDoing gens you?
1;So this game is far from perfect but that does not ruin it at all. There is something just so fun about this game no matter if you play survivor or killer. The dev's have the communities intrest in mind with each patch even if it really does not seem like it....ever. Plus with how often it drops new killers/survivors the game never gets the chance to get stale. Ramblings aside I would say this game is a solid 7/10 with the true potential to be a 10.
1;"""If you have never played this game Do Not Start. This game will change you and the way you see your fellow men. I've seen bugs in this game no one should ever have to witness. The dumbest and most toxic community I've ever seen and debs who """"did a pretty good job"""" in you've never touched this game stay away for the rest of us. 4/5 gotta love the devil if it loves you back."""
1;I highly recommend this game but like with every other game there are problems. Personally I would love to see a voice chat the survivors can join in to talk and player hit boxes need to be improved. The game has gotten worse as it has progressed but it isnt aweful and I still love to play it. I would also like to see more emotes for survivors and maybe some for killers too. Over all this game is pretty good and definetly has a lot of potential.
1;Finally hit my 100 hr it is a good game.However this type of game may not suit for anyone it take time to know about the game and most importantly you need to have great temper management.Anyways it is worth for a try if there are sales throw you tap on it and have a taste!Enjoy the game and be nice to others! D
1;EDIT They have done so much to rebalance this game. There are still a few issues I feel like here should be one or two more pallets but now when I play as The Pig or The Trapper it's not completely useless. Killer gameplay is less frustrating and survivor gameplay makes me sweat on occasion.Good job devs!
1;pretty nice game and the most important thing worths it's money.Really worth.THe single problem i met is that the FPS in High quality are meh and on ultra high i have like 10 fps but on medium 90.So the devs should better optimize it.But it is a really nice game to play
1;Basically it is a cat and mouse gameI personally like the learn curve also this game allows u to level up pretty quickly since the 2.0.0 update.also its not pay2win since u can also play ur way thru most of the non copyrighted chars thru the shards nowa dbd survivor
1;"""This game is great but the community is as worse as LoL/csgo/overwatch community...I recommend you to put your """"Comment Permissions"""" Friends only because you will get tons of toxic comments to your profile when you out smart other players in this game. You can check my profile for examples.You can only talk to others at the end of the game or at the game lobby. (not with the killer though)4/5TL DR great game &gt 4/5 but put your profile private"""
1;I played Advance Wars religiously for many many years and have been waiting for something to scratch that itch for so very long now.Wargroove delivers everything I wanted so well along with so many extras like functional online play and the awesome campaign creator. (really looking forward to what the community can make)If you ever liked Fire Emblem Advance wars or anything they inspired you need this game.Here's hoping to religiously playing Wargroove for just as long!
1;I love Wallpaper Engine. It is very addicting. I especially love the aquarium and the camel on the desert and the barbarian on the desert at night... and many others. The music and dance wallpapers are fun to watch but too distracting for working. There are marvelous creative wonders that show what the future of computer entertainment holds. The basically unlimited expression across cultures provides hope for the future.
1;This is a very good application for basically nothing just 4 dollars and with that you can get a huge selection of wallpapers thanks to the steam workshop. Also I have always found wallpapers that move to be the coolest so I mean this is 100% worth it. I need to add this first of all with the purchase wallpapers that you can get I would suggest not getting those because when I purchased it it wouldn't let me use the wallpaper so I just wouldn't get those but other then that I would get this app

1;At the time of posting this review my game time was/is 666 hrs. That says alot not just in the short time that I have owned the game but the fact that I have basically sold my soul to the devil to play this game as much as I have and I have no regrets doing so.The mods complete this game there are so many and so many good ones the community is awesome too.10/10 would sacrafice a feminist vegan to see this game in first person/3D/VR.
1;When i saw it i thought ewww this game doesn't look good but oh i was wrong. Im addicted to this game. I Now can't stop playing &amp thinking of what to do in this game. Mods make the game even more better and exicting to play very pleased! 15 Well Spent.
1;Factorio has been one of my favorite games of all time since I bought it and it only cost me a couple hundred hours and most of my soul. Beware while playing as time does not work the way its supposed to while this game is running. I typically play for about an hour and then quit only to discover it's actually been almost two days and I'm really friggin hungry.100/10 would addict again
1;Finally a game that works perfectly on a Mac when advertised. I love this game. My brother and I have been playing this for awhile and we've been making a huge factory on our LAN server. This game is great to play with friends and fun to experiment withI've died 3 times all from my own trains. 10/10 would die again
1;This is probably my favorite game. And I mean it's up there with Halo 3 and Portal. If you don't want to buy this game because it's early access trust me it's better than many full releases. Besides what are you gonna buy besides this game? Tuition or a house or food? This'll do.
1;I admire the developers for creating a work of art. I love playing this game and am proud to be part of its community. I can imagine where the developers and the community will take this but I definately can't wait to see it. Please become part of the journey and if you are already bring your frineds along as well.10/10 For those two of you who understand binary but also for the other 8.
1;I kinda wish this game was built by a machine and that the end goal was to build a machine that would build Factorio so that I would be teaching a machine to build itself while designing machines that could build themselves so that the machine could build itself by making machines that can build themselves.8/8 would make game play itself again
1;MP don't even try without broadband connection also don't a lag compensation which causes more lag than it tires to hideotherwise an open sandbox. if you don't mind buildung spending your first 2 hours in the game exactly the same way in every map you start.there is a serious lag of end game goals but you can spend so many hours in optimizing your production chain that you get your bang for your buck as long as you like optimizing production chains.
1;"""&gt Crash on planet.&gt Don't know where the I am.&gt Steal minerals from the locals.&gt Build factory.&gt Kill all natives in my rocket powered tank called """"Mega """".&gt Use the natives juices for """"science"""".&gt Lay waste to their land in Mega .&gt Build bigger factory.&gt off home in my rocket.&gt Get home.&gt Play Factorio.&gt It's pretty good."""
1;Factorio is a game that once you get into it youll never want to stop playing. youll spend hours on a creation just to tear it down because you thoght of a way to make it more efficient. the main perpose of the game is to do work makeing something that will do work for you. I dont have much more to say than to just get it you wont be disapointed.
1;What do I think of Factorio?Let me tell you what I think of Factorio...right after I adust this belt. Oh no I am running low on iron ore. Dang it how come my power is so low? Where are my lasers? Oh great my plastic isn't being manufactured. What is going on with my oil production?(4 hours later)...what was the question again?
1;A fantastic game with endless potential due to the modded community gives a certain replayability. The playtime for the main game is insane over 24 hours to launch the rocket and then you can conitnue to create crazier and crazier factories. A wonderfully satisfying experience if you enjoy creating everything from nothing this is the game for you.
1;"""Even at 400+ hours I have only """"beat"""" the game once (by launching a rocket into space). Most of that time has been spent in the vanilla game and yet I still feel like I have so much left to learn.Every time I start a new playthrough I learn some new techniques discover something new or come up with a new challenge to try.There is just so much to this amazing game.BUY NOW!"""
1;Playing Factorio is kind of like studying with your friends for an upcoming exam.You quickly realise how many of you should probably be on a disability spectrum and that one other dude is so next level he's probably the reincarnate of Socrates or something. Factorio is the Rick and Morty of video games.
1;Sooo... Factorio....Think of this game as... if Minecrafts Tekkit or Feed the Beast or Tech Mod Packs had a baby with OpenTTD.Now put that baby on Steroids. You'll probably get something like Factorio.Just don't be alarmed if you don't realize your alarm went off...If that doesn't tell you enough i don't know what would to be honest.
1;I love this game I bought it at the Factorio website before it was even on Steam and it was amazing even then. You start with a drill a furnace and a little bit of iron. You turn those things into a base wich can be attacked by aliens. You have to survive all the while working on refining your automatic crafting your furnaces your turrets and most importantly working towards a missile silo to launch a satellite into space. Lots of fun and multiplayable.
1;"""Played this for several dozen hours presteam just through less legal means. Using the excuse """"Oh I'll just buy it once it comes to steam"""". So once I saw it was released on steam (and climbing the most popular tab) I decided to keep my promise. I'm glad I can finally show my support."""
1;You wanna know why people some people cant give this a review?Cause its just going to waste their time on not building their factoriesThis has game has taught me alot about handling situations that seem too overwhelming. just gotta take it slow. breathe in. and then cry when someone else (aliens) comes over and gives you more tasks to worry about.
1;The game is fun and refreshing (comp mode that is I don't care for casual) but it needs A LOT of work. NWI has been putting out frequent and promising updates but I'm still far from satisfied. Far from e sports ready but still has a whackload of potential. Give this game a shot and if you're more patient than I am then you'll definitely be pleased.
1;a really good game if you dislike it off the bat then be persistent and you will most likely begin enjoying it. if you have no luck playing pvp like me play against bots or play coop for some time this will help you get used to the unique playstyle of the game. i digress THE GAME IS FARKING GOOD.
1;Best game ever!!! The Devs actually listen to the comminity unlike AAA titles. NWI has made some great games with Sandstorm actually being a good sequal to the orignal insurgency. They did a really good keeping the feel of the original insurgency running on source engine and keeping that same feel on the new Unreal 4 engine. Game runs great looks gret and the competitive scene is very friendly. I would highly reccomend this game!
1;Fantastic game if you've got a newer to newish cpu runs way better than it does than the stuttery mess on console. Be warned this game is very cpu intensive so if you've just been skimming by with a quadcore from 6 years ago you're going to have some issues.
1;Won't have much to say beyond what most detailed reviews have already said. But it is worth mentioning that while the connectivity issues can be frustrating the rest of the game is incredibly fun if you have even a tiny interest in playing Monster Hunter World please give it a shot.
1;Playing on my laptop i7 6700HQ 8GB RAM NVidia 950M GTX installed on SSD. Works absolutely fine loads very fast graphics is at low but fps is at stable 60. I understand people are having issues with Denuvo and hopefully they will be fixed for them fast. I had no issues so far.As for the gameplay I have already put a lot of hours on PS4 planning to put just as much on PC. The game is very fun both in solo and co op and offers different playstyles with all the different weapons.
1;The game is good now connection issues are non existing so ignore those reviews. This game has plenty improvements over the other entries nature has traps monsters don't (always) team up against you and the specialized tools are great. The new monsters are super fun to fight music is amazing and the overal atmosphere is great!9/10. Needs more layered armor.
1;Having problems getting it to have controller support? Try this Click Steam in the top corner of your Steam App Click Settings Controller General Controller Settings Enable Xbox Playstation or Switch ControllerThis solved the controller problem for me! )
1;Two of my friends and I spent 200 hours looking for our friend Don. We inquired with every monster in the New World for Don's location. Some were more stubborn than others lethal even.The pieces came together. We found Don. Hardest hunt ever.Where's Don/10.
1;Do I recommend it? Yes. Is it perfect? Far from it. But it still scratched my third person slash em up RPG itch.Biggest positives Presentation combat movement mechanics map design are all fantasticBiggest negatives Poor optimization / performance spotty matchmaking and barely functional multiplayer servers (probably launch issues but nonetheless) some fights get very tedious
1;It's a pretty great jump into modern systems. While it does have less content than the most recent old gen game this is understandable since they're building resources back up from the ground. I spent at least an hour in the training grounds just playing with all of the new weapon mechanics. They managed to add something new to each one and there is a tremendous amount of quality of life improvement across the board.
1;To anyone reading this who likes what they have seen but is on the fence about getting the game due to the mixed reviews the few MINOR issues this game does have are so inconsequential compared to everything this game gets right its truly puzzling to me that someone could be so off put that it could cause them to not play what is truly a great video game experience.
1;Wtf how is it even possible that I've not been playing right from the start?To be fair this is my first MH and I was pretty overwhelmed at the beginning. But between the early confusion and now one thing hasnt changed the game has such a powerful suction force. Great 9/10
1;Dont get discouraged by the mixed ratings. most of the errors disconnections and bugs on release was patched recently. there's still few minor fixes left but the game is still progressing as long as there is patches the game will get better and better. 10/10 excited for future updates and releases &lt 3
1;Network issues and missing content aside this game is phenominal. I adore it and just want more content and monsters and G rank to fill the voids in my heart that MH4U so easily filled.Also there's an Ultrawide mod now that works flawlessly even if the HUD is a bit offset )
1;i loved it on the PSP and i love it even more on PC+cool armor/weapons+loot drops from monsters you kill+awesome storyline with epic cutscenes+interesting monster mechanics+tight controls and variance with weapons+great QoL improvements to make the game friendlier to new people+nice updates bringing it up to par with console performance is so so multiplayer is buggy at times
1;Amazing game. Gameplay is great although I hate The Handler side character extremely annoying. Also the multiplayer net connection bug is still a major issue. Althought this will hopefully get patched soon so don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews
1;The multiplayer connection issues were pretty annoying in the first week but I've noticed they've been a little better the past few days. All in all I've had a blast with this game so far. Looking forward to the content that's been released on console to make its way to the PC version.
1;Short and simple this is my first Monster Hunter game and I am having a blast. Yeah it has a few performance and connection problems but it's amazingly addicting and that fun experience outshadows the minor inconveniences! I don't seem to have performance issues like lots of other people plus my friends and I are all able to play together without disconnecting so it's a thumbs up from me!
1;Highly recommendedDont look at the old reviews as there were server issue when it first came out on steam. They have made progress fixing and the server are way better now while they are currently still looking into the issue and fixing it.Awesome combat systemMultiple weaponaryGood endgame contentMultiple events weeklyMonster slayingHave quite a learning curveStill awaiting upcoming update contents
1;Pretty good. Tons of stuff to do. Going co op or multiplayer isn't a must until you reach Behemoth. Even then some players are able to take him down solo. If you do wanna go co op or multiplayer just join a server with a lot of people or fire that SOS flare. People are quite friendly and are more than willing to help ( here in Asia anyway)
1;This is my 2nd time buying it and even with the current state of affairs (8/17/18) I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's got tight combat a satisfying grind and could be the gateway drug you need into the franchise. The current issues with the port are being addressed by Capcom so I hope the influx of rage reviews isn't hurting the game.10/10 80 hours in the first week in.
1;"""Best Monster Hunter game series! I love the new features on game. Updates Event Quest new Monsters and more Take note This game is still unstable don't buy this game if youre having a """"P O T A T O"""" PC specs..upgrade your hardwares before you buy this game for better Hunting Experience!"""
1;So far I enjoyed playing this game. It's challenging fun and really worth my time. I love the graphics the gameplay system and character personalization as well. Although there are still many problems that need to be fixed especially the connection for co op multiplayers you can enjoy this game as solo player. I hope that the connection problem will soon be fixed as I want to play this game with my friends without being disconnected every 10 minutes or so.
1;Put some time it what does it do well? Performs well for me Only conectivity issues occured when alt tab'ing Well rounded game experience Enough value at price pointWhat does it not do well K/B mouse controls Lack of true binding system many pc players are used too Clunky keyboard radial menu When I want the game closed...close the f'n game don't care where I am Did I say K/B mouse?Overall I enjoyed the game but easy to see why some may not be able to overlook the poor port issues
1;My very first MH game have to say that so far it's a favorite! Currently I have had zero performance issues with this title. My current setup i5 3.4gGTX980ti16GB DDR3Win 10 64bitI can't recommend this game enough if you're just looking for fun. The multiplayer is a little clunky with the menu setup but its operable and functions fine. Almost 90 hours played in my first week and I hope to keep at this game for some time to come.8/10
1;Product received for free. In the reviews i saw here are stupid this is a very good game just hard. If you play it by your self and defeat all monsters then you'r a god but otherwise you always need a team luckuly there for is SOS. Yes the game has glitches but they can always be fixed un like Assassin's creed... In this game you find out what grinding really is and if you dont like it then get a friend and do it with him so it be more exiting! Final verdict buy the god damm game!!!
1;I was expecting review to be like Overwhelming positive.......But still a Good game!!I have played on PS4 and end it up getting on a PC as well!! )It's really fun and amazing game! Mostly I'm playing as solo. I hope they fix the online part though.Happy Hunting!!
1;7/10would be 10/10 capcom needs to fix the settings and controls for pc imo. I get random frame drops and crashes and online dc. No ultra wide support as well. Capcom needs to fix these problems and the game would be a top notch title for any game library.
1;Good game great gameplay works as intended despite a few minimal flaws. I can play with my friends most of the time. Went into this series since the PS2 era and I'm happy this gets ported to PC. Most recent patch made multiplayer better I haven't DC once since then.Like Monster Hunter in general? Don't miss this out!
1;This game is everything I ever wanted. Im a pretty casual gamer but I can't get enough. Trust me that does not mean it is not diffcult. Maybe not like Freedom Unite difficult...but I fail an average of 5 times per hunt and I still return. it's that yummy. As an animator and modeler I am constantly impressed by the work that went into this. Japanese games are typically no short of sexy.
1;Long story short. Low lvl players get lookt down on.High lvl players look like god. ____________________________________________________________________Make sure you get some friends who play it so that you wont need to solo it!The game is really slow if your alone. trust me im lvl 80 and i only have 2 3 friends i play with. The game is hard but really fun with friends. so i strogly recommend you to get it IF you have friends____________________________________________________________________

1;My childhood game much anticipated for the online version since 8 years and now it is finally here. Thanks Capcom you are awesome.Game runs smoothly and everything is working without an issue using xbox one controller and detected immediately. Don't know what these negative reviews are all about but if you like this type of game go for it. Game of the year.
1;A number of QoL improvements over previous titles make this game easily accessible to newcomers but a large amount of depth and semi hidden mechanics make sure that it's not too simple for the advanced player. A grinding system that has properly satisfying rewards does wonders to keep one playing and a huge variety of playstyles in the 14 weapon classes ensures you're likely to find something suiting for you. If you've never played Monster Hunter it's for sure a good time to start.
1;Its Monster Hunter. Its on PC. What more do you s want?Really though any of the (minor) problems that occoured during the launch are all fixed up now and everything seems to run smoothley for me. Its a great game with hours of content and is constantly getting updates.
1;This game is honestly fantastic... Yeah it is having it's network issues but no point in freaking out I'm sure they're working on it. And anyone complaining about this hogging up their entire CPU are probably trying to run it on the highest setting. Turn everything down and it's fine. I'm hitting max 65% CPU usage on an I5 8600k and running 60 FPS easy...
1;Great game to play with friends. Specifically now after they have fixed the online issues. I don't get disconnected anymore at all. I'm happy with my purchase and looking forward for future content. I'd gladly buy expansions for this game if we ever get any since I already played the game more than a 100 hours without getting bored.By the way this is the first monster hunter game that I have ever played.
1;I understand and respect people's issues with the connectivity problems but anecdotally speaking it seems the issues are being ironed out. I haven't dropped my connection to a party in the last week or so.The game is fantastic and will only get better.
1;I mostly play solo due to me being lonely and bad at soicalising so ive never encountered the 50382 MW1 error code however the rest of the game is amazing to me ive only played one over entry to this series which was MH3U and i found it amazing so i was happy to get a MH coming to pc. i thibk this game is amazing however i do find a few frame drops and the lack of optomization disapionting but those are the only issues i have amazing game if you have the pc for it.
1;I recommend this game mainly because i have played every release that was in the united states buying multiple different consoles specifically for this game and with it now being on pc it takes a large burden off me. Also to be frank how can a game where you hunt giant dinomonsters with giant weapons not be simply badass?
1;you basically kill things to get stuff so you can kill things to get stuff... faster.the reviews on the pc version are mixed probably due to the connectivity issues during the first few weeks of release. as a ps4 immigrant i would encourage first time players to stay on for the upcoming content it will be worth it.
1;A great grind that focuses heavily on combat and environment.Not much of a story but that's not the focus of this game.Track big monster kill big monster skin big monster make bad weapons and armor repeat.If you like variety there are plenty of different weapons each with a unique playstyleDefinitely good dollar/per hour valueI mean I liked it enough to buy it twice if that says anything.If only we would get the street fighter events...
1;Wow I'm really not sure why the game is being reviewed so badly on steam.There are a few glaring issues (TAA makes the game as blurry as a unfocused camera for **some** people (first switch to fxaa or turn off antialiasing) multiplayer connections can be a bit spotty) but the game itself is fine.Realize before you buy Monster Hunter combat is and always has been very methodical. If you attack chances are you will watch the full attack animation before you do anything else.
1;'People can't find settings menu and rather complain instead' simulator 2018Yet the game is awesome + runs smooth on 1070/4790k almost all maxed up &lt 3Although you can't really play online because 'A communication error occurred'Also pls can I remove bloom or make it lower at least? _ Yaaay!...
1;A great beginner friendly entry into the Monster Hunter franchise. Great sense of progression in that you actually feel like you are a better player rather than just a noob with better weapons. Will keep you busy for hours has occasional updates with new monsters/events and reduces several of the obtuse gathering headaches of previous MH games.For fans of the older games it may be worth a look at the negative reviews to see if the game's changes are your cup of tea.
1;Monster Hunter World is a bit easy game compare to console game line such as MHGENX and its previous versions.There's only 2 outcome while playing this game. Either you get bored or get addicted and spend 10+ hours a day.Only down side on this game is disconnection when connecting to other Online sessions. Other than that it's worth the time!
1;my first MH game ever and i am very satisfied with the gameplaypro's story darksoul like (less crazy) too many to make amazingly fun with co op fluid movement Con's server still ed up (hope they'll fix it soon) frame drop when there's a multiple eletric element weapon
1;As a newcomer to the series I have nothing but praise. A very good game. Easy to grasp hard to master. It's just the right mix of Diablo/Borderlands (the loot mechanics) and a Hack 'n Slash. The port itself is OK. It's a basic Japanese to PC port. So some things are a bit off but there's nothing alarming. It runs and functions above average.
1;everyone that has a negative review on this game have lost their minds. the game is great. yes there are connectivitiy issues but what do you expect from a company that has rarely put out pc games. they're at least trying. other than that the game is fun to play. i highly recommend the game do not listen to the negative reviews. give it some time for capcom to work out the kinnks and it will be even better. it's the first week.
1;well its a fun game.. played the 1st one.. and thought its gone forever .. now it show up again D ....best game ever XDStill fun as ever beLearn movement set Farm for stuff to make u more powerfull..and some funny moment with the Random Player..Patience is the key don't Rush 3
1;It's Monster Hunter. Either you like the series or you don't.If you're new to Monster Hunter you'll need to look into some in depth gameplay videos lest you end up like many others complaining about legitamate features/mechanics as if they were issues.
1;Only problem is work/kids/life get in the way!Awesome controls epic fights and amazing graphicsEdit 48 hour mark. Issues still stand wish I could find more hours in the day. Tells you something when you wish certain monsters would leave your buddy (barroth) alone. He just wants to roll around in the mud and be free.First timer to Monster Hunter and likely now a lifer.
1;This game isn't something where you go and slaughter everything you see. If you honestly think that's what the game's about you are in for a surprise.2 3 hours in is tutorial w/ forced cutscene to get you immersive with Monsta Hunta. I'm running with ai7 77kGTX 1060Also for the love of god don't call this a dark souls clone you uncultured swine. This series been around since the Playstation Classic. Edit Hey Capcom remove Denuvo DRM from MH World
1;THX CAPCOM my time in life lost for your game Thank for give me a new experience from gamei don't care graphic or space PC I play for Adventure &amp for FUN 100/10 FROM ME NOICE GAMEAre YOU READY Become to HUNTER !?Let's get it SOLO STYLE Wait for next event
1;Most of the negative reviews are regarding the bad port. Well the port is indeed bad but if you have a decent specs you shouldn't have problems and it's written the minimum specs. So it's a useless hate... the game is wonderful and runs perfectly fine.
1;I don't understand the 55% postive reviews this game is golden its well optimized controls great sounds great looks gorgeous and has hundreds to thousands of hours of content I don't see this many negative reviews for dark souls cause of the M&amp K controls so what gives? its a yes for me capcom!PS It's still good
1;I have to say that monster hunter language translation is sloppy at best. Fluent monster hunterese speakers such as myself actively struggle at times to make out what the characters in this game are saying despite the setting. Pronunciation is all over the place and grammar wasn't even an afterthought. I seriously hope that capcom can fix this in the future so me and other Monster Hunters can enjoy the game in a way meaningful to us.
1;A pure masterpiece.Have over 450 hours on Monster Hunter TRI for the WII. Planning to squeeze out of this baby at least twice as much.Thank you for this great great game Capcom. Easily one of my most favorite games of all times.Never in my life i enjoyed a grindfest as much i enjoy it with this game.Buy it. You won't regret it.
1;Another monster hunter. Another ten out of ten. This one is definitley the newest and most innovative improving on everything from previous titles. Some people seemed to have given the game bad reviews because it didn't run well. I had no such problems.The game is amazing. Worth seventy bucks for preorder deluxe version. This may be my faovrite monster hunter yet. 10/10.
1;The most accessible Monster Hunter game to date allowing beginners a chance to jump into this awesome franchise. If you play this and like it but wish there was more either get a 3DS or a Switch and play some other games in the series. They are harder have more content and the knowledge obtained from here can mostly be taken into other games to makes getting into them easier.
1;yeah ive been waiting many years for this to become a reality and im just happy its here fun fact MHW on started devlopment on pc when the game was released on console and it was their first pc release in their devlopment history if your curious about more MHW fact head over to did you know gaming to find out moreEDIT server issues are fixed 9.5/10
1;My friend and I have only gotten into the Monster Hunter series in the last few years but my god is it a phenomenal franchise. I cannot tell you what a pleasure it is to go from a DS to a PC Monster Hunter game. I appreciate people have had issues with the game but my friend and I haven't had any. The gameplay graphics and just overall enjoyment of this game for us is top notch. I couldn't reccommend the game enough.
1;37.7 hours and not a single disconnect on my end most the people complaining about disconnects are probably at college or on wifi. Don't let those deter you from this wonderful game if you have good enough internet or hell single player experience is great too.
1;I have played over 100 hours on my sister's ps4. I bought the pc release without hesitation for the content of the game. As foe today the dev didnt update the game yet and the netcode are terrible. Disconnecting etc ... plzz dev show the pc port some love..
1;Great game! Very much enjoying it even after I've hit endgame for a while now. I never really had issues since the beginning neither with the optimization (i7 4790 with GTX 780 playing at 40 60 fps) or with the servers. There is the occasional net issue but it's usually resolved by me resetting my net.
1;People are complaining about thing that we knew for a long time won't be in the game. Game is great and works perfectly if you meet the minimal requirements. We don't have any confirmation about denuvo doing anything but people still complain yes it's far from perfect but stop being sheep and have your own opinion.Still great.
1;The new Nvidia drivers still cause the game to run only on cpu I'm using a i5 4460 intel cpu and a gtx 1050 ti. The older driver 2 patches before the new RTX nvidia driver works fine but I would obviously love to use the new nvidia drivers with the game working instead of keeping the old drivers
1;i5 6600k Overclocked to 4.0Nvidia 970 Stock16gb RAM60 FPS on Medium High Settings with some frame drops during intense fights with tons of particle effects which is expected400+ hours later between PS4 and PC (Yes I double dipped) and this game is still addicting as ever. Sure it had its hiccups at launch with connection issues but that has been fixed for most with the latest update. Gorgeous game with amazing gameplay and 100s of hours to immerse yourself into the New World.
1;Played it on xbox it is a great game and it runs smoothly on my computer. I'm going to enjoy it to the max! I understand that people have complaints about this game but it's quite good. I haven't had one big issue. Only one little issue and that is when I lose connectivity to others online but other than that the game runs smoothly and has continued to keep me entertained )
1;after playing it for a while here is my review its a pretty fun game if you got friends to play with graphicly its oke here and there some weird bugs but overall pretty good gameplay wise at first the game can be pretty disoriantating with with its controlls fast and intens... pretty good addition to your collection but wait for a sale
1;Capcom did a good job imo fixing bugs that were introduced with the beginning of the game. They communicated multiple times they were working on things (connectivity) and even put out smaller patches that helped reduce the issue before they were able to completely fix it.
1;One of the most fun game I have played! The story is not that interesting but the gameplay is what is excellent in this game. Some people have fps issues and other issues that Capcom trys to fix and releases updates quickly when it comes big issues that effects almost everyone. It is a full game when it was released but there is updates that add new monsters and other additions that the game doesn't need but is a very nice addition.
1;Game is awesome runs way better than console. Load times are quick. Multiplayer has been fixed. They threw out content fast. Highly recommend playing. Great addition to the seriez been plaging since freedom unite and I really dont have any complaints besides them taking out oils for sns lol
1;Yes there are some connectivity issues. Yes the port has some optimization issues. It's still worth full price. This game is a masterpiece. Once you've gotten used to the flow of combat and familiarized yourself with the progression loop it's incredibly fun. This game is somewhat of an acquired taste but once you've acquired it nothing else will do. Fixes are on the way but the port's sufficient for now.
1;Well this is my FIRST monster hunter game...Kudos to the amaizng graphic There are so much to explore craft and things to do .This game is amazing dont let the negative reviews stop you from buying this game . Solo feels way better then mutiplayer .The server might have some disconnect issue.Those people whom gave the game a bad review are filthy casual. If there are network error then play solo .This game is similar to dark souls so try to git gud or GET TF OUT .10/10
1;Great game. Epic fight. Solid game play system. recommended.However online session lag of player interaction. Gathering hub is so empty. 200hrs in game but no interaction from multiplayer session. Just slaying monster and disband. It would be better if online session is more lively.
1;Super fun game so far. Many people complaining about kb+m controls but I used them for about 4 hours at the beginning before I switched over to controller and they werent unplayable or anything. Would reccommend having a controller though its a little smoother and easier overall it feels. Game looks really nice too + theres lots of content.
1;i5 6500GTX 970I don't have a crazy PC but after almost 10 hours Stable at 50 60 FPS with medium graphics which are still BEAUTIFUL Not a single crash/bug Controller supported without any issue (I'm even using my Switch Pro Controller) Amazing game. The MH every fan wanted.
1;trying to dowload this game was a series of misfortunate events such as reaching the quota limit for my internet mid download and having to go to my relatives to continue the download and even sleeping over at their place just to game but I can say it was totally worth . this game is incredible and just soo fun I can't stop
1;The latest and greatest addition to the Monster Hunter series. I have been playing these games since 2009 and I can say without a doubt that Monster Hunter is one of my favorite games of all time and this installment is no exception. I also managed to get my skeptical friends to play and they absolutely love it. Whether this is your first Monster Hunter or your a long time veteran there is something for everyone to love about this game.
1;Few crashes since updating drivers and turning graphics settings from Highest down to High and setting frame cap to no limit! (Restarting seemed to fix the crash on launch issue)Definitely the best Monster Hunter experience to date! Can't talk need to play more Monster Hunter!
1;I am immensely enjoying this so far. The only problem I have is the Radial menu and the occasional DC from multiplayer sessions. I have not experienced any issues besides the DCing which is not as bad as it seems. It gets annoying when doing long sessions but its not every match.I would recommend this as this issue will hopefully be resolved eventually.
1;Game looks good and runs fine. Been playing with friends online its pretty fun.I wish it was harder like it was on PSP. I feel like its a little to easy. Could be because i've played the other games and understand what to do. Hopefully a mod or a hard mode will come out. That would be my only complaint.
1;i played this francise back when psp was a thing and i enjoy it so much. and then i got this news about the game goin to pc. so hell yeaa i'll buy it even though it's a rough start with connection and multiplayer issues but now it's enjoyable. if you want solo hunt go... go then need help just fire sos. this game is the most newcomer friendly imho so it's a good start if you want to jump right into the franchise.MORE MONSTERS PLZ!!Happy Hunting!!
1;Love this game so far! Been playing the monster hunter series for a long time and I'm loving being able to play on PC! Little rough around the edges on the first week but I'm happy with the game so far. Would 100% recomend to anyone that likes boss battle type games!
1;The games amazing really fun to play with friends and solo. There's the occasional disconnect from friend sessions but can be easily rejoined. Alot of negative reviews for small things that you would expect from a game thats been out for 3 days. Alot of this stuff will be ironed out eventually just give it time. The gameplay is outstanding with alot of fun elements and doesn't feel to grindy if you want to get a specific item set or weapon.420/10 IGN
1;From playing a lot of the other games in my past and playing this one I can say that the new combos and interesting mechanics are what make this game different. I completely enjoy everthing about it including the graphics. Highly recommend this game for anyone looking to play an rpg with friends or solo.
1;Product received for free. Best port game of 2018?What to say...........Feels Great Runs Great Looks Great has events can be easy but can be hard variety on weapons and team combinations play with randoms or friends etc.One thing i really enjoyed was the fact that we play(hunt) with teams of 4 but you can create a lobby up with 16 friends from there joining and playing different monsters and team combinations and be able to help a lot of players.
1;Its a game about grinding for getting mats for upgrade ur gear but the fact is that grinding in this game is really a great thing. It has some connection issues that can be frustrating but it s definitely a solid game for having casual game times. It has lot of action the history is good and it has a lot of weapons with diferent combos. It is somehow similar to Dark Souls in the way you fight with the creatures but its not as dark as DS.
1;Tons of exploration. Really enjoying the game in spite of early headaches getting the settings just right. Outside of the monster hunts the game can be quite chill I really like running around the map and seeing what I can do. Oh and fishing minigame is life.
1;Yes there are kludgy bits that stem from this being a console port.But you should still buy it.Monster Hunter is the greatest boss fighting video game franchise of all time and while the learning curve can be steep the payoff and feedback from killing monsters and turning their parts into specialized gear for killing other monsters is an incredibly addicting loop and I've been enthralled since MH Tri hit NA on the Wii.
1;Game is great and runs great on high resolution textures even on my 6 year old Sapphire Radeon HD 7970.If you're experiencing high fps drops I recommend putting your GPU in the oven like I did. 195 degrees centigrade for 9 minutes. I oven baked it after it stopped working and now it performs better than it originally did.
1;I was on the fence about getting this game. But my buddy convinced and I had a blast the main story was great even though I was trying to blast through it quickly so I could start hunting with my friend. (He could help me with main story quests after I had watched the cinematics which is kind of annoying.) None the less it is a blast to play and hopfully we get alot more monsters to hunt soon haha!
1;"""Played since 4U and have experienced connection issues since then. IMO Capcom has improved MH's connectivity issues but it still needs to have a major update for connections and 'solo"""" play lobby. Overall the gameplay is great. Lots of new things such as a much more nature filled terrain new armor system SOS calls etc. Still feels like a Monster Hunter game and doesn't give you the feeling that you're playing a game from another series."""
1;Want to leave a review but dont want to stop playing.Killing monsters while looking like an action hero is awesome.Video settings require some tweaking to get a smooth experience.Inventory is great with a controller but terrible with a mouse. Use a controller.
1;It's an amazing game as Monster Hunter always is but I can't play multiplayer at all. Communication error occured error code 83 MW1 every 10 minutes and Failed to connect to session members error code 50382 MW1 when I try to join a friend or matchmaking. Giving a recommend in hopes that server issues fix.
1;"""It's a really fun game glad they ported it to the PC cause I don't buy consoles. The port could have been better but giving a game thumbs down with the phrase """"amazing game"""" in the description is a contradictionin my book. Me and my buddy have been playing pretty regularly for a while now with only occasional connection issues but it occurs so infrequently that we barely notice and the quality of the game certainly makes up for it."""
1;I have a pretty decent computer that can run on highest settings with a flat 60fps. I don't know why people complain so much about optimizataion not every game can run on a toaster after all. The servers are a bit of an issue but you cant expect god teir servers on launch. Specs Processor Intel core i7 7700k RAM 16gbGraphics Nivida 1070
1;The game is amazing! It is essentially Boss battle the game. Beat on super cool monsters with ridiculously large weapons and make sweet looking sets of armour! My only problem with it is the online play you can't just PLAY through the story with your friends which really drives a wedge into the fun you are having. But there are ways around it so it isn't the worst.
1;All I'm reading is people need to get good.The network issues and unskippable cutscenes / cutscenes being mandatory to hunt together are completely valid criticisms.But the gameplay ones are just hilarious. Get good. You play this game on its terms not Dark Soul's terms not God of War's terms it's own terms.Learn the monsters and learn your weapon and you will be rewarded with a deep and almost infinite gameplay loop.
1;If you like delibrate methodical combat i cant recommend MHW enought. Its quite confusing and a bit frustrating for new players but for those who put in the effort its greatly satisfying. It needs some tweaks performace wise but nothing game breaking. If you've played MH before these no reason not to buy MHW I highly recommed his game.
1;Everything works fine for me despite all the negative reviews (I know it's not an argument but still). Game plays at 45 60 fps 1440p. My config 1070GTX i5 4670K 16 Gb DDR3. The only sad thing is that the game doesn't support* 21 9 (the game has the resolution options such as 3440 1440 and similar but you'll have black bars on the sides of the screen). Hopefully we'll get a fix for that soon either from modders or officially.
1;Take most of the negative reviews as written by negative people yes some are valid as not major changes have been made and the controls do take awhile to get used to on KBM and DOF does need to be added as an option to be turned off. However the game does deliver what it delivered earlier this year and improve its visuals and gameplay.
1;Can you change Manage Investigation UI maybe adding some sorts delete selected quest etc when you spent half of the time on investigating it really sucks that you have to scroll all through to really get what you want. others game is great really brings back some memories and maybe fix connections issue
1;Bought a PlayStation 2 fourteen years ago to play MH with my friends. Playing MHW with them now and it's the same great experience if not better because others whom have been waiting for a decade for a PC release in English now can join in on the fun.
1;This game will be going in my favorite games list. It has great gameplay good controls (I play with mouse and keyboard and have no problems) it has a good difficulty (not to hard and not to easy but you should learn the movesets of the monsters) and also the graphics are not that bad. I dont have any crashes or one of the other problems but I hope that they will fix the problems for some of the players so that everyone can enjoy this game.
1;A great game with a lot of problems in it. The problems usually aren't about the gameplay but the errors. I guess months of porting didn't mean too much huh? I love the game and I hate it at the same time. I'm enjoying it quite a bit tho so I'll give it a thumbs up. Hope the errors get fixed soon.
1;This game is just amazing the graphics the new mechanics and weapon combos. A newbie and a veteran can pick up this game and can easily learn how the game works. the story is okay but the main thing here is hunting monsters and how you use your environment againts it. im almost at my 300 hrs mark and it still feels fresh to me. Overall i recommend this game to both new to the monster hunter franchise and the veterans. hoping for more free/paid dlc updates!
1;It's one of the best games i've played this year and it completely catched my attention. They also fixed a lot of conection issues and the multiplayer is so well designed i love it even being a lone wolf! The comments about the content not coming to PC are (for the moment) all true and i understand their anger however this game is just too good to not recommend it
1;Pros The game is awesome! Fun to play interesting gameplay lots of customization etc.Cons Unskippable cutscenes! Why?Spending 2 5 minutes between missions to watch characters chat can be annoying but doesn't ruin the game for me. Makes subsequent characters annoying to catch up though.
1;Totally addicting game fresh idea learning curve is above normal and the game is fun. Each weapon plays like a different a game and its 14 type i doubt you will get bored just learning all the playstyle not to mention build alter playstyle of the same weapon too which add more fun Almost the negative review are already patch up very long ago. Some peps dont change there reviews anymore. You are missing alot for not playing this game so i recommend purchasing this game
1;"""""""I'm just thinking to myself right now we should just cancel the election and give it to MHW right?""""""""I thought killing monsters would be easier than my old life.""""""""Why can't we use nuclear weapons?""""""""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes blood coming out of her whatever""""""""I know more about monster hunting than the generals do. Believe me.""""""""I have tremendous respect for monster hunting women.""""10/10 The Don"""
1;This is a very smooth game well worth the time. While optimization does seem to be very rough I am able to run it in medium settings smoothly with a mediocre pc. It never lost the charm of the previous titles that drew in such a cult following while it's new features made the experience feel new but the core aspect is still intact. 10/10 recommend.
1;Great game a standard that should be set by all game studios. Free content being the main thing.Had little to no server issues so you shouldn't worry. Also googled for an fps fix which rolled back my nvidia drivers. I went from 13fps in rotten vale to 50+. I suggest this if you're having problems.
1;Overall it isn't a bad game the story is enjoyable despite skipping over most of it to catch up with my friend. Prior to Winterfest's release a lot of players have been crashing mid dungeon and haven't really been given much insight on what to do. Some days I couldn't clear a single dungeon because of these connection issues and other days I never experienced any issues. For the most part though I never experienced any issues with the game outside of the fact that I was not very good.
1;I've never played Monster Hunter until now and WOAH BOY is this an amazing start. As you can see I am insane and have spent every waking moment playing this thing learning every weapon type building a huge armory finding EVERY LAST DAMN PET.Get this game you will not regret it.
1;Product received for free. If you've ever considered getting into the Monster Hunter franchise I highly recommend picking up this game. It's much more friendly to new players than recent installments the game is beautiful the creature design is fantastic and the combat feels absolutely great. No other game has fufilled my fantasy of jumping off a cliff with a rocket powered greatsword into the spine of a monster quite like this one has 9/10.
1;It's fantastic. If you can be patient and wait for Capcom to iron out their network issues and you play with a controller I can easily recommend this game. After playing on Xbox and Playstation the PC version is definitely the best version. My biggest complaint is the PC community's skill level. Y'all need to look up some videos or read some forums and git gud.Feed me with your hate filled comments. I love you all.
1;My first monster hunter experience at first I hated this game. The port turned my 1080ti into a nuclear reactor the camera was awful and i couldn't find a weapon I was good at.Giving it a fair shot I disabled some seemingly useless graphics options and my temperatures returned to normal I looked up a guide on how to git gud with my edgy katana.Now I think the game is brilliant except nergie screw that dragon.11/10 would melt my pc again.
1;Don't listen to the overall review score. This is without a doubt the best Monster Hunter ever take it from someone who has played every mh since 3. I've put in over thirty hours with as much multiplayer as I want and only had one disconnect during a mission. Connectivity is great and the environments and new monsters make this game a near perfect experience.
1;This game marks the biggest leap forward that Monster Hunter ever did. During the first half of the game the gameplay will be easy to pick up for newcomer while the second half is challenging it does everything right to bring new players and veteran together.
1;Steam reviews are worthless. Literally most of my favourite games have mixed reviews on steam. Top rated games are usually dumb indies with no depth at all and boring and basic mechanics.(see cuphead). PC community is either really casual or too poor to afford a decent pc. Probably both hehe. 0 connection and perfomance issues here my new rule is to plain ignore steam reviews when getting a game.
1;"""It's ok I guess.Monster Hunter World releases on console January 26th. Lunastra is then updated into the game May 31st. (About four months)Monster Hunter World releases on pc August 9th. Lunastra is updated into the game November 22nd. (About four months)""""ACceLeRatED CONtEnT ReLeAsE ScHeDuLe"""""""
1;all the haters.Is the game perfect? No.Is the game great? Yes.I am very critical when it comes to games. I haven't preordered a game in 10 years but I did this time. I am grateful Capcom finally gives us a Monster Hunter for PC. Hopefully updates will come to improve the experience.
1;Brilliantly optimised. I will see how the game progresses and edit this review accordingly. Been an MH fan for a long while and this game looks to meet expectations.They ve also almost completely fixed the bugs that plagued online multiplayer which is good.
1;A fat mountain broke a cruise ship that I was riding on I stopped the chubby volcano from destroying a wall then after several quests I killed a fat mountain and it nuked atlantis then we killed a negrigante and then a zombie dragon got mad 'oh you killed my friend so now I'll kill people' then I killed a baby lizard who kept shooting kamehamehas from its mouth.
1;"""worth every penny for the frame rate and load times alone. the increase in quality concerning everything else is just an added bonus. I think once steam and or capcom gets their stuff together and remedies some of the horrendous disconnects from friends//fixes """"private"""" sessions the game will be a perfect 10/10. hell it had 200k+ players on day one. tldr if you played this on ps4 just buy it again it's worth it."""
1;Fun game with lots of content. Sure hunts may be frustrating. Your team mates can be incompetent. Your a hammer main who is trying to do the big bang combo on a monsters head but then a freaking long sword main keeps making you stutter. But nether the less it is a very fun game with the devs adding in free content and with the iceborne expansion coming soon there will be lots to do
1;This game is good VERY GOOD.If you haven t tried Capcom s Monster Hunter World you really should. Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay Beautiful and varied worlds So much depth to its systems Each monster is a new challenge Story is actually engagingThe fun never END....
1;EDITED They fixed the server heres ur thumbs up.The game itself is 10/10 fun and addicting ONLY WHEN U PLAY ONLINE W/ PEOPLE.That is why fixing ur server is THAT IMPORTANT because if u compare it to any other single player game this one is nothing.*Do rebind ur keys cause the default ones sucks.
1;When I was buying the game I had some doubts about whether I will like it or not but I liked the style I liked the world. So far so good ) I will agree to people who are complaining about performance because game looks to be poorly optimized but since I have decent pc Im able to enjoy. I will still go ahead and recommend this even though optimization is bad.
1;Really fun game overall. The availability to play with friends is a bit limited but not enough to make the game unplayable. If you want to enjoy the game to 100% you should get the Console version. But the PC Version is still playable and fun with friends.
1;Thanks capcom for porting this to pc but the online multiplayer please fix it.It always disconnect and showing 5028f mw1It's not funny when you half way hunting and disconnect the monster stay strong meanwhile me only player to fight with it.Pro 1. It's monster hunter with better gameplay2. Graphic is goodCons 1. Multiplayer keep disconnect (not even fix it)2. Halfway hunting can disconnect too3. Connection again
1;Played many MH games since Freedom unite.I've had 0 crashes 0 fps issues on my setup Ryzen 7 1700xNvidia GTX 1080 2 fan FTW2The only negative I can really say about the game currently is that G rank is missing as well as many connection issues. Despite these problems I will have to say that the game is really good for both new and veteran players and would be even more enjoyable once connection issues get fixed to play with friends/other people.
1;A great game. A little easier than previus entries due to greater player power and mobility in general. Great shame it is in such a poor technical state. Remember how bad Dark souls ran? Remember how great Dark souls 2 ran? Lets hope Monster hunter world 2 (or howerver they decite to call it) will take note from From software. And add more difficult enemies.
1;MH W was well worth the wait it's difficult rewarding and most of all well fun now that multilayer issues seem to be resolved. The wide range of weapons provide a playstyle for everyone and levelling a weapon (not the character's str dex luck etc) gives you the ability to swap weapons at any time and continue your play through unhindered.The chase for better gear seems long and enjoyable so I better get back to it! May the sapphire star guild you.
1;if you like solo monster hunter this is ing amazing. it's all the good bits of monster hunter and none of the trash like underwater monster hunting *puke*if you have never played the series before try out a cheaper game in the series before you buy this since monster hunter isnt at its best until like 40 hours in.if you wanted multiplayer then i guess you could just keep praying for a patch because the constant connection drops in this game makes co op suck a fat one
1;Phenomenal game. Have played the PS4 version for a couple hundred hours and it's amazing how much smoother the PC experience is. Load times are barely there with an SSD I can keep a solid locked 60 fps with an i7 4790 K RX 580 8gb and 16 gigs of RAM at settings that while not maxed out still look way better than the Ps4 version.
1;I have had no performance issues anywhere after tweaking my settings a bit the mouse controls feel good. Default keyboard controls aren't very good but everything is remappable. Gameplay is very fun. Lots of tedious mechanics from old Monster Hunter games are gone so there's more time for just hunting.
1;Don't play this game with mouse &amp keyboard because it's clunky af. Wanna know an example? Play Charge Blade with mouse &amp keyboard and feel the cancer. Previous MH titles were either played on handheld or controllers. This game is clearly not made for mouse &amp keyboard despite being a PC port. #BringBackRajang
1;It's an excellent game but the port could be better ... It's not as bad as people make it up to be Dark Souls was way worse in that regard.If you've got an i5 8600k and a GTX 1050 you can run the game just fine on low with true 1080p at around 50 FPS.
1;Coming from an Old MH Player the game at its current state is pretty good and a lot of fun to play with friends with. Though there are still some Optimization issues but other than that it runs smoothly on my system on Mid/High. Monster Hunter World is indeed grindy game but thats the fun of it and really a joy to play with the new mechanics they added.
1;This game is truly fascinating with you as a mighty fighter destroying those big bad monsters.They might scare you from time to time as they come charging trying to kill and rip you into a thousand pieces however as you show them who is the real boss you know that this game changed you.I showed friends and others in multiplayer how a true man is.
1;It's a FUN game it's just lacking some features that a PC port should have (I.E. more in depth graphics options).It's also currently suffering from an issue where some people just can't launch the game due to an issue with certain CPU's and GPU's but that is fixable and according to Capcom the devs are working on a fix now.
1;Monster Poacher World teaches you the importance of sustainably preserving an ecosystem by allowing you to infinitely farm various legumes such as pickles right where they grow so magnificently that they even spew out Coke when you squeeze and love them just hard enough.10/10 on release will be 11/10 once the (free) pickle DLC made its way to PC.
1;A huge improvement since good old PSP days. It's totally playable solo yes it need performace tweaks &amp dependable servers... But besides that HOT DANG this game is realllly awesome ! I'm a veteran and mostly play solo all the way to G Rank missions so for now I don't really care much about multiplayer. Git gud.
1;PROS addictive tons of depth lots of different weapons types with unique playstyles multiplayer is fun bosses are challenging but rewarding crafting system is good graphics are nice mods are supportedCONS hitboxes can be buggy at times cant skip cutscenes dialogue can get annoying cant customize characters body (only face/hair)
1;It's fun. The port runs very well I get a solid 60 fps in 2560x1280 with everything maxed out (mid high end PC). Controls great with a gamepad wouldn't bother attempting it without one.I've had lots of connection issues connecting to one specific friend but haven't had any multiplayer issues at all with anyone other than him. Also just the way that multiplayer is designed makes any kind of co op during the main story a pain but... who plays MH for the story?
1;Product received for free. Ignore the whiney people downrating this game they obviously don't know how to operate PC's.I bought it on Xbox and a friend gifted it to me on PC. It runs infintely better on PC controls aren't bad. (Why aren't you using a controller anyway?)I've seen a lot of FAR worse PC Ports this game had a fine launch just as it did for console.
1;A game that has taught me about the importance of proper levelling and resistance management.Seriously f*ck the first Nergigante fight. Spent 30 minutes beating that as*shole three and a half f*cking quarters to death then he just dive bombs my as*s like a special ed kid at the pool.
1;I want to take this time to apologize to my school my family and my friends and anyone else who is going to believe that I m dead for as long as this game is out there. Very fun runs well on my PC and my machine is not by anymeans top of the line. Great progression customization and above all challenging combat. Loving this game!
1;Spent 500+ hrs on PS4 and now this!!This is kind of the game you can easily spend 1000 hours on itThe dev keeps updating free contents. Performance For me it's pretty good with i7 6700K + GTX1080 with controller supportI'm using Dualshock4 and I don't need to use any external mapping programs but the button layouts are XB1's but I'm okay with that.
1;amazing game been loving everything from it so far!this game had some issues with connections but they are working on those and for me personally there gone for most of the time being.this game is great in many ways also i have met many new friends in a discord community.https //discord.gg/ZVgyVgtry it out.See you soon
1;There are definitely some issues with this title's multiplayer functionality and frequent disconnects are definitely a thing. However when all is running smoothly this game is amazing...I've been no lifing it with friends in Canada and the US since release and I've felt both challenged and rewarded.When the connection issues get ironed out it'll be a 10/10 for me &amp easily Game of the Year. Until then its an 8/10.
1;&gt be me&gt new to Monster Hunter&gt open up Monster Hunter World&gt choose insect glaive as class&gt work my way up through the story&gt get Black Diablos quest&gt try to hunt it&gt manage to get it to turf war with a barroth&gt excited as &gt they back up and charge into each other&gt barroth took it like a &gt barroth limps away while diablos turns to me&gt never abandoned quest faster before in my life&gt sweaty af&gt 10/10 would never mess with a black diablos again
1;Product received for free. Great game I'm a huge MH fan. However the cut scenes and intro sequence is way too long I just wanted to drop in and play with friends but I had to play through 10hrs of campaign before that was a viable option also the multiplayer is verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry buggy at this point.
1;Connection issues aside it's a solid game QoL changes are nice (with the exception of the ability to get new items at camp) and all the weapons including the newly added Charge Blade are fun to play with but at the same time monsters are a little too easy so we will have to wait until Lunastra and the evil pickle Deviljho get added. Game would be amazing if it had G Rank.
1;played monster hunter on the psp a decade ago and never finished it.played monster hunter world on the pc 2 weeks ago and finished it.great game good pacing never letting me down. but beware of the op monster. his power drops frames. 4th wall breaking. amazing.so many hours into it i still haven't found an attack gem tho
1;EDIT THE CONNECTION IS FIXED THIS MAKES THE GAME 50% MORE PLAYABLE.The game is good now we just wait for patches that may or may not come to improve performance and mouse issues.Turn off volumetric rendering though. It trades what looks like an awful gray filter for 20 FPS.
1;Most of the negative reviews are coming either from the launch of the game when the servers were horrible (fixed) or losers who have nothing else to do but put 700+ hrs into a video game and then complain that there's no end game content (sad!).It's great play it.
1;I love this game I really do. Unfortunately it has some major connection issues when trying to participate in online play. I've caught word that they intend to do something about it That alone would make this game a hundred times better but until that happens trying to hunt with friends is nothing less than frustrating.
1;monster hunter world. basically a solid monsterhunter game on steam!negative reviews here are mostly salty because of little network issues.like the game its fun farming a lot. story line takes like 40 hours if you take your time. post game content still okayish!only sad thing is list of monsters in this game is pretty small in comparison to the 3ds titles and mhgu.
1;Hallo everyone.I make this just to say that the keybord and mouse are working just fine i have no problem with it at all and the game is running super good on a nvidia gtx 980Ti i have no lag at all and i have maxed out the grafic i will say that it is the best game that have come out so far on steam and. Thank you capcom for making our dream come true.
1;After the online connectivity and mouse control fixes I can definitely recommend getting this game. Good combat lots of weapons co op character customization wiggler head. This will almost certainly be my game of the year.Note As of November 2018 the content update schedule is really exploding. I hope it stays ACCELERATED like the devs promised so we can catch up with the console version.
1;A good and solid experience 30 hours of fun in just 3 days so far sure it has some problems in multiplayer but they are not a deterrent to buy it for sure since it's more likely to be a server overload problem just like in the ps4 launch.EDIT In the last patch the Multiplayer problem was fixed mostly I have played 5 hours straight with friends and still no disconnect issues
1;First impression playingNice game and the graphic so smoothly for me _ Update after playing 500 hoursOkay being a player who wasting time to half 1k hours kinda bored becasue the update kinda slowly hope Lunastra and Kulve Taroth coming out as soon as possible.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter game and it absolutely rocks!Pros Easy to pickup the basics Good unique list of weapons Combat is great! Multiplayer is great when it worksCons Multiplayer is unstable. Its prone to disconnect. Keyboard + Mouse support is not good. Mouse movement is not smooth and the default keys are confusing.
1;If you enjoy killing researching the local wildlife this one is for you peeps. Loooove me some of that sweet sweet MonHun genocide researching goodness. Best part is you can use your victims research studies as parts for some badass armor and go slay meet the now orphan sad kids looking like their mom a real fashionista.
1;Monster Hunter World is a great addition to the series. It easier then the rest of the games merely because of the fact it has less clunky controls. MHGU feels like fighting the controller as well as the previous games. MHW is truly the next gen upgrade Monster hunter needed. I hope MH5 is in this engine but has all the content of MHGU or MH4U. This is a great jumping in point to the series.
1;Game is honestly stunning probably my favourite Monster Hunter game so far. Performance on my i5 4590/RX580 had been smooth except for some slight frame skips when elemental weapons proc.Multiplayer is very spotty at the moment however the game is still strong when played alone.
1;Amazing game! Writing this at roughly 300 hours of game play if you're having troubles slaying monsters remembers to keep upgrading your weapons and armor look for builds and make sure to use decorations. very fun. just wish the PC version would catch up.
1;Apart from the over the top salty fanbois having a fit being behind on content i'm enjoying this immensely. My first MH game and i can see why it's really popular over yonder.Playing on gamepad but used K+M for the first 40 hours and they weren't that bad. There's even a patch announced to further improve keyboard and mouse controls.I like it. And I definitely will also be checking out Generations Ultimate on the Switch.
1;God damn it I can't believe that people are still giving a bad review right after a port console to pc has just been released. Instead of giving a bad review because you have issues with the game just ing wait till they fix it at least this game is a really good game but performance issues can happen when a game just released give them at least a little bit more time till they fix all those issues ffs...Btw I'm running on a gtx 1060 6gb and i7 6700k no issue so far just a very demanding game.
1;Great game with Bad server I would still recommend it to my friends. But plz fix the servers I am now getting so tierd when either me or other players just randomely got DC. It's now more like a single player game there is the option to play with friends but it just does not worth trying to connect for an hour and still could DC anytime it somehow really ruined the gameplay. JUST FIX THE SERVER and the game is 100% perfect.
1;people can be monsters too!yes the game has had connection issues in the first couple days. yes it was kind of annoying. yes it is already getting better and no it was not worth being legitimately upset about.This game takes the fun parts from the previous games and eliminates almost everything that made them annoying. Very happy to see the series making strides to refine the mechanics rather than just pile on more content.
1;As an old Monster Hunter veteran the game feels refreshing and beautiful on every corner of the world. Yes it had a rough start for this PC version but with the latest patch release couple days ago I have not experienced any lagg or issue with online gameplay in fact I played over 6 hours on 3 days in a row and 90% of the HR quests I played were online with upto 4 players with not issues or whatever. A truly challenging way to hunt down monster and kill some time. Highly recommended!
1;An absolute masterpiece this game is fantastic and probably the best monster hunter game in the series. If you rated this game badly because it didn't run on your computer or bugged out then just buy a better computer and don't blame capcom for you not having a good PC.
1;Never had connection issues Never had a bug occur Never had a crash my pc sucks i don't know how everyone keeps having problems. Gameplay is great I have not finished the story (nearing the end) but its about what i expected (go here fight big boi go there catch big boi) Optional missions and investigations mix things up having you hunt multiple monsters and what not to get qol stuff. Would reccomend using a controller movements feel better than keyboard+mouse
1;I love this game so much but I wish you could throw the insect glaive at a monster and in later versions it having a cool effect based on which ever path you went down. Like having it summon a lightning bolt at the last stage if you went down the electrical version.
1;This game deserve better review. After deviljho update the connection seem become better. Even I'm still facing connection issue and the game will freeze a few second sometimes. The gameplay is fun. Hopefully Capcom will improve it in the future and I really need Nargacuga in MHW. lol
1;And excellent game haven't played Monster Hunter since Tri on the Wii and I'm having more of a blast here than I ever did before.My only complaint is the terrible optimization for PC's this is the first game I've ever had trouble running since it was built. Even with every setting at its lowest you'll never get full FPS and I've had a few instances my computer shutting itself down due to overheating which has never happened before. Only buy if you're truly confident in your rig.
1;100+ hours in using HH/SNS/IG/Lance/GL and it's great. Biggest problem(s) I have are the horrible texturing and optimization issues both performance and connection issues. Other than that it's been a great journey. Also I'm HR 100 so will anyone farm Sapphire's Guidance with me?
1;Awesome. I never tried a Monster hunter world game before however I am truly enjoying the experience. I don't really usually enjoy games where you often have to grind the same missions for rare items just to grind more in the future for more rare items. However every round of monster hunter feels different and it is really fun too constantly being slaying monsters for that new greatsword you want. I recommend this game to almost everyone and worry about getting addicted!!!
1;I'm a new player in the Monster Hunter franchise and I must say that the gameplay is pretty solid.However this game faces serious connection issues.For those who have issues with fps drops try rollback your NVidia Driver to 398.36I recommend this game if you don't mind playing solo for awhile.
1;This sounds and looks like a great game but it wasn't working for me. When I open it it opens showing a normal window but it is completely black. Then it would load for 5 minutes then say it has stopped working then close. Then the update to try and fix it came and my results were the same even after the fix. And putting it's priority as high as possible. Please fix this. Besides that issue I would recommend it.
1;Big fan of the franchise and an even bigger fan of the quality of life changes made in World. Since they fixed the communication issue all I'd really like right now is HDR more large monsters and the option to skip cutscenes (I've played through all of the content available on the PS4 and Xbox One versions).
1;"""For those who are having trouble connecting with friends because it displays """"Failed to connect"""". Make sure you and your friends have watched the cinematic individually then you can play together. Another thing to keep in mind is that when you join someone else's room and the host leaves everyone in the room will disconnect. So when you hunting with friends make sure you host a room. Overall the game is enjoyable. The co op system sure needs some fixing but it's still playable."""
1;This game deserves better than a mixed rewiew currently it's gone through a couple of connection issues but that is to be expected since it is the first Monster Hunter to be on pc but after the recent patches I can say it is definetly worth the buy for any Monster Hunter veterans or anyone wanting to get into the Monster Hunter games!
1;This game is worth the money Guys and Girls. Don''t hesitate to buy it and support the developers.I'm a long time fan of MH games and all I can say that this is the best in terms of graphics and QoL improvements. With these we all know that the difficulty of the game will lessen. But every generation of MH games become easier because of the improvements.Enjoy the game. You can finish the main story and even the optional quest solo.
1;I can only comment on the gameplay since i have not had fps issues that a lot of the negative reviews are about and all i can say this is a an amazing game and also very pretty.There are currently occasional disconnects that the devs are trying to fix i havent had many of these but they are very annoying.I would say if you think you can run it give it a try its great.
1;Very fun very smooth both gameplay and optimization wise. I can run it on a laptop with no issues and have been playing with keyboard and mouse so far with no issues at all. The connection problems are a tad annoying but I mostly play solo so it doesn't affect me much.
1;Incredibly fun game once you get the hang of it. Not for everyone but if you have no problem with grinding then give it a shot. This entry is perfect for newcomers to the series and is easily the most accesible and user friendly Monster Hunter game to date.
1;Worth the wait. Went in blind (yes dodged EVERYTHING for the 7 months it was out on console) and my friends and i enjoy it thoroughly. My only problem with the game is that progressing with friends through the main story is wonky since you have to watch all the cutscenes together. Everything else however is fine to me. Also it is optimised very well. Good job Capcom
1;Played 700hours on the console version waiting for this pc port. The game series I love through out the years finally on steam. Playing it on all high settings but still waiting for the multiplayer fix it's still buggy. Im currently hunter rank 51 and almost 60 hours gameplay as i write this review.
1;Its a good game but it does have some annying things like my fps dropping to 30 when somoene uses a lightning weapon loosing connection to servers and having to change the resolution settings everytime i get on because if i dont i get 2 black bars on the side of my screen these can all be fixed and i hope they do
1;If you understand how the game mechanics works and you are used to these kind of grinding games you will love it. WARNING Can make you addicted to the game!I have not had any problems beside the multiplayer connection which is already known but this will be fixed hopefully very soon. Definally recommend it!
1;The Monster Hunter World PC port had a rocky start with graphics drivers issues from Nvidia bizarre graphics settings in game and connection issues. Launch issues aside (all of which are problems unique to PC) the game is a lot of fun. The game is a ton of fun solo or with friends has plenty of content now and more to come.
1;Over 100 hours into this game. Still havent completed the main story. Sure it's had it's hiccups at start. No great game launches flawlessly. Grouping with friends was a little difficult at first but once everything was figured and the connection patch everything has gelled. My friends and I have been having a blast slaying everything in our paths
1;So despite the Online issues The core gameplay is solid. It looks gorgios as . and it invoks a sense of wonder with each new area and vista I find that I haven't felt since I was very young and picked up the Original game way back on the Playstation.Maybe pick it up once they patch her up a bit theres a Fantastic ing game in here.
1;The game is one of the BEST ive played in a LONG time.BUT the servers are so BAD i cant even find words to describe it!!!I WANT to love it because its fun and challenging but it makes it realy hard to like it when you get several error messages or disconnects on a daily base...I still recommend it because i belive at some point the servers are getting patched enough so the game runs stable. Just be aware of the flawed servers...
1;Monster Hunter World is absolutely amazing. Sure the game has some disconnect issues but it isnt bad enough to not recommend the game. It is extremely easy to join back to your friends sessions so i find it just a mild inconvienice until they push a fix through. Definitely one of the best games of the series thus far.
1;it's a very fun game. performs and loads so much better than the console version. ignore the haters they're not real monster hunter fans. rollback your nvidia drivers and your performance improves tremendously. capcom support confirmed that they are resolving the online issues.
1;Hand's down best game out there going to be spending a lot of time here regardless of what others have to say. keyboard feels werid but once you get used to it it is fun. Co op is pretty nice doe's really well if you have discord buddys. ingame mic is low so no one use's it I dont think and if you press Insert while in game it opens text chat so you can still talk to other's. The story is nice aswell map creation was flawless and looks beautiful.
1;Don't let the negative reviews deceive you.I got this game as a gift from a friend who was constantly playing it.At first I was a bit unsure. I felt like the game wouldn't be that much fun.Boy was I mistaken.The game is incredibly fun and the combat is superb.I've managed to squeeze in lots of hours in a short time and I am definetly going to keep playing it.9.5 / 10
1;I'm editing this review to positive since the connection issues patch came out and mostly fixed all the disconnects. If you have been waiting like myself to hunt some big monsters or even play a Monster Hunter game title with your buddies this game is for you... It's easy to understand the game mechanics and the gameplay is quite fluid and fun.However!Beware as this game is rather unoptimised so I recommend setting Volumetric fog at Low or even Off if you dislike the effect.
1;Can all you complaining about the poor connection stop playing the game so the servers clear up for those of us with even a modicum of patience? In all seriousness though need to get this connection/server thing sorted CAPCOM! The game is phenomenal as ever however and all three of the very different PCs in my house run it fine so not sure why so many people are having framerate issues...
1;If you're already a fan of MH games then you'll love it. It took a little tweaking to get it running smooth and the online functionality has some issues but that will get fixed in time.Definitely deserves better reviews but I'll still enjoy putting several hundred hours into the game regardless.
1;Great game but matchmaking is utter jank. The fact that you can t join a friends hunt until they ve seen all cutscenes is a joke. Then when you finally get in. You ll be 10mins into a fight and the whole group get split into single lobbies... beyond that. Great game
1;This is the greatest game ev... Connection to the session has been lost. Error 50382 MW1.Don't worry I'll rejoin again. Searching for an Online Sess..Failed to connect to session members. Error 50382 MW1.Error 50382 MW1Error 50382 MW1Error 50382 MW1Did I mention Error 50382 MW1? Great game ruined by Error 50382 MW1.Edit They actually fixed the connection problems there are still some issues with it but it's very rare.
1;Gameplay 10/10. Absolutely incredible as expected.Edit Game is now 10/10 across the board since they fixed the online issues.Runs incredibly smoothly on 6700k &amp 980ti. Maxed out settings and 60+ FPS. Just turn off Volume Based Rendering or whatever. The volumetric fog. It looks bad and kills your framerate.
1;Even if you look at all the negative reviews very few actually say this is a bad game. There are problems with the PC port but none of them game breaking. The issues are annoying at absolute worst. Capcom has a history of supporting their games post launch so I don't expect any of the issues to persist.
1;Played it on console gonna grind in PC version. Very good in terms of combat and gameply smooth and got a lot of fps in highest of settings. Absolute game meeting expectations of a fan and a gamer. I only have a bit of hard time using controller because of the default control keys so I had to configure them to my liking. Overall Excellent
1;"""Worth my waiting time when I saw it on PS4. As a monster hunter IP fan I absolutely love it. About the connection error it suck of course but please this it Monster Hunter most of your time you have to grinding alone. I am also love playing cooperative with my friend but it not that bad. If you new to monster hunter IP this is the game for you.If you old to monster hunter IP you already had it right?Beside the """"mix"""" result for bad connection this game is amazing!"""
1;Although it's not the hardcore monster hunter game we're used to the graphics and fluidity make this game amazing. You get used to the ease of use changes Capcom made and begin to appreciate them after a while. It's my favorite monster hunter yet. I definitely recommend if you're not a salty hardcore MH veteran just have an open mind if you've played a previous MH game.
1;A little less challenging than previous titles which makes the start of the game a bit more soft than you'd expect from a MH title but there are some challenging fights in there even for seasoned hunters. For newer players I expect the curve to be nice and smooth. I feel there is little else to say than that this is an amazing adaption of the series.
1;Like many Monster Hunter games before it this game is a great addition to the series. I personally have no other problems except connection issues sometimes but at the same time I get to enjoy 60+ fps beautiful gameplay that is smooth as butter. These games have always had amazing hitboxes and fun gameplay like carrying eggs! I highly recommend purchasing this game if you love progression and challenges that will never end with a multitude of weapons to learn and master.
1;Good game bad release. It's a very fun game even better playing with others. Unfortunately the game is plagued with multiple different and unfixable connection issues. When I play I'm lucky if I stay connected to the server. Even when playing alone constantly getting the MHW 83 disconnect error.I would recommend this game.. but you should probably wait until Capcom gets better servers or for the popularity to die down.Update TConnection issues resolved. Great game.
1;I love the game and its one of the best ive playd. But ing hell man. After killing the final boss of the game I get a bug that dosent let the final cut scene finish and it crashes. Please for the love of god I want to keep playing the game but IT DOSENT LET ME. If someone has an answer to this problem then please help me. I have more than a 100 hour already and it feels really bad that this is happening now. PLEASE HELP.
1;Works well for me even with a computer below recommended specs at 1080p for the first 12 hours. All setting are set to low but for someone who came from the 3ds version of the game it still looks great to me! Game would appeal to those who like a mix of MMOs gear grinding Dark Souls esque combat and those who like to strategize for difficult fights beforehand.My specs for those curious Intel i7 6700HQ8GB RamGTX 960m
1;some time error when is try to connect to online season automatic move to offline mode it's like crash i think the serve is not stable yet. when i in online season im olso can't see another player in village maube make list player on monitor with the name it will be great so i can see how join in my room. i hope it will be fix as soon as posible.. i feel not comfortable about this problem.
1;I have yet to see ANY of the issues players are complaining about. The only issue I have seen was when I encountered 2 network errors with my friends and they were easily fixed. Gamers these days are too lazy to figure out how to work around problems on their own.
1;Like all games it's not for everyone.It's a lot of grinding and it gets harder as you go on. And a lot of people feel like it gets repetitive.But it wouldn't be Monster Hunter without it.Multiplayer is even more fun when it works. Yet there are times when it doesn't.Overall I enjoy playing it.I've been a fan of the MH series since 2007.
1;Pretty fun game be it multiplayer or solo. The story until now is a bit shallow but the gameplay is what shines the most here getting to know the monsters and learn new weapons is really fun and makes the whole experience worth every dollar. Fully recommend it grab a couple friends as well and enjoy.
1;While this game does fit into a niche type of Audience if you would like a game with a great single player challenge fun co op expierences and very extensive end game grinding fighting large bosses over and over Look no further. The servers on PC are kinda crap and still need a lot of work. PC options also aren't great BUT there is a lot of great consistently delivered content.
1;They need to implement a 'fashion slot' into the game because I'm sick of my character looking like a hobo with horns and fur randomly sticking out.But otherwise I like that I can just be lazy and let other people carry my butt and still clear all the content.
1;I dont care what people say this game has plenty of variety and challenges to do always something to keep you busy. Also runs like a loop which is a fun break from LoL recently. I give this game 5 Stars. Running on my inspiron 5675. 16Gb RAM (dual 8 DDR4) radeon rx 560 AMD a10 9700Wish there were more character skins though...
1;By reading reviews from people who got it on the release date i was expecting a worse port to pc honestly i totally recomend this game its a must have for fans of the franchise and a worth triyng for newcomers mostly if you manage to get it with an offer.
1;Newcomer to the MH series this game has 90% enslaved my soul. It would be 100% but connection issues and PC port issues are very real and The Handler is probably one of the worst supporting characters I've ever encountered in a game.Palicos are cute af.
1;It's hard to specify what this game does correctly when it does so much correctly With a Dark Souls esque combat system that focuses entirely on boss fights and a ton of variety in fighting styles this is enjoyed both solo and in groups. Don't expect a hack and slash as it might look at first glance but there's a ton of depth here.
1;Really enjoying the game has various flaws but a recent patch has addressed some of the glaring ones so I have faith they'll continue to improve on it and eventually catch up to the console releases.May want to consider waiting abit until more of the current bugs are ironed out but even with them ive pumped stupid time into this and loved it.Continues to get updates some better than others still grand.

1;After coming from the PSP and 3DS games I'm amazed to see what they could do with Monster Hunter on something more powerful almost 5 hours in and I'm loving every bit of it so far and being able to jump into other hunters quests is quite awesome. Seems like a good entry game for people new to the world of Monster Hunter.
1;I put a lot of hours into this game and I enjoyed every minute of it. The game has a variety of weapons and monsters for you to use and fight. Also the game has pretty good graphics and most the environments look pretty nice. Some cons I have on the game is I wish they would add more monsters and fix bugs on the game quicker. But overall I really enjoy playing this game and I would recommend it!
1;Fantastic game good old coop fun really cool weapons that play very different and offer a wide variety of play style . Right now there are alot of disconnects but the game did just release and server trouble on a new games first few days is nothing new. So far I very much reccomend this game but if your still unsure go watch so reviews/gameplay videos
1;Really wish they woulda included the ability to skip cutscenes for the intro. First several cinematics take about 30 minutes and having 300 hours clocked on the Xbox version its annoyingly long. Besides that the graphics improved greatly thanks to being on better hardware voice sync and voice lines match up better than the xbox version. Besides the slow intro great game!
1;Don't let all the butthurt reviews fool you. This is a good ing game. While co op functionality is not working there are very few working multiplayer functions on day 1 release. If you like monster hunter you will love this. If you're new to monster hunter you will love this. People really need to stop dropping bad reviews because of some day 1 problems that's just ing .

Buy it have fun with it. Don't group with players with Chinese text in their names.
1;The game itself is great bringing a lot of that Monster Hunter which I played back on the PSP to modern day. There are a lot of quality of life improvements which I like and others which I hate (I hate the weird lock camera lock on). Big problem is still the constant connection issues.I recommend this game yes but if you want to try and play with your friends its going to get frustrating.Lastly git gud.
1;Took me a while to digest the game. This tittle is like driving a foreign vehicle everything seemed backwards and unintuitive at first but after a while it just clicks. It s a bit rough around the edges missing some pc settings no hd textures but steam is not getting a game as polished as this for years in this genre.
1;Not the most challenging Monster Hunter game not by a long shot and very very strongly lacking in endgame. However it's a great introduction to the series and while it goes over the top on making the hunters way too powerful to the point where the monsters feel like they're at a disadvantage it's still very fun.It is a monster hunter game so expect to have to grind if you want armor or weapons and expect there to be mechanics the game doesn't tell you about.
1;Its definitely not for everyone but if you like boss rush kind of games with a bit of grinding this might appeal to you. However the first hour or 2 might be a bit boring and the game wont be as fun if you go at it alone. Make sure you have friends to play it with to maximize the fun you will get from the game. You can play with randoms online but it will still be more fun when playing with people that you know or at least talk with even when not playing the game.
1;Amazing game. Terrible servers. I will change this review to positive once the servers are fixed.Edit Haven't had any issues with servers lately. Not sure if they did something but as promised this review is now positive. ) I love this game as I did the previous MH games.
1;Monster hunter world is a different experience from the past monster hunter game for example the environment interaction the monster fight with each other and the map is huge!! This game will definitely be another great experience. I kinda miss velociprey though (
1;After hundreds of hours on console I picked up the PC version and this is the definitive version. A smooth 60fps makes a great game even better and I'm having a blast replaying this content. I waited to pick this up until they ironed out some of the bugs and I haven't had any issues with the PC version at all. I highly recommend this.
1;This game is great if you have a good computer. If you don't then sucks for you. Go buy a good computer. If you're poor I have recommendations 1. Stop it.Network errors were and are being addressed DLC is probably going to be oncoming since they can force download monsters unlike what was done on nintendo systems because steam allows more freedom as does Sony albeit not much better than nintendo.
1;Absolutely amazing the multiplayer is currently having a lot of problems but gameplay wise 10/10 skill based game graphics 10/10 made me tear up when I first saw the beautifully crafted world the monster AI is very realistic and the game is very immersive(Day/Night Cycle Monsters fighting each other and doing other stuff not much more can be said verbally since this game can only ever be judged by experience.
1;i am editing my previous review to state that the connectivity issues have been fixed. Me and my friends have had many hours of just plain fun. this is probably one of the best multiplayer games on the market. It can be played completely solo and is still just a fun as well. ignore the negative reviews for the connection issues its been patched and fixed.
1;It's Monster Hunter on PC and gameplay meets all expectations. I haven't gotten much if any lag at all but graphics can be disappointing in some settings. Need to fix the random disconnects in multiplayer servers and matchmaking is sub par. I'm optimistic it will improve with time and so far am having fun with the game.
1;"""Just the right amount of challenging. Soloed the game because day one online co op was impossible but it had the satisfaction of getting past something challenging without the darksouls """"if the game wants you dead you will die"""" programing. had a fun time"""
1;I've been a monster hunter fan since it launches in psp. Pre order MHW and I'd sure it is worth my waiting and beyond my expectation. Improved combat system and graphic quality makes the game play alot of enjoyable. However this game is not mouse+keyboard friendly nor is the muti player connection stabliity.
1;I've been playing Monster Hunter since the PS2 days the game has never felt this smooth and looked this pretty.I'm 38 hours in and haven't seen any bugs crashes glitches.. whatsoever.If you too are a long time fan of monster hunter but are on the fence then don't worry about it.It's amazing! Lots and lots of QoL improvements (including some things to make it easier on the new players)My new favourite game of all times.
1;Monster Hunter ReviewPros Nice Graphics Great Combat Monster Design Controller Support Cons Terrible Co Op Experience Turn off Volumetric Rendering to boost FPS. No 21 9 Support (I have a ultrawide monitor so this is extremely annoying.) Hopefully a decent mod will come out.Final Review 8/10 Will update this post when I complete the game.
1;This is one of those games where i say this is the last quest and before i know it i go from 3 hours to 14! So far this game has been a blast and i would recommend this. But if you can get this on console over the pc seeing as the pc version has DenuvoDRM.
1;"""If you want to smash some skulls and have fun throwing your weapons around and shooting stuf up and doing tons of dmg and having fun with others and do missions together than this is a game for you if you like to have a go at some big monsters and see what you can do than this is a game for you sure i only got 12h but all thoes 12h were 12h of pure fun and enjoyment.""""Worth every euro i payed for it"""""""
1;recommend this games because im love this game but what the hell with the datasave local save?after change to another pc loss all the savedata?capcom know how to make a pc games?this games is publish on steam now so just let the savedata link to steam cloud not hard disk
1;Only haters would give this game a negative review D Seriously I love this game. It's different to everything else in a good way. The connection issues got fixed everything works as it's supposed to do and now there is nothing to complain about.I hope people change their negative reviews to positive. Many of them did it becouse of the connection issues which have been fixed by now. This game deserves a far better rating.
1;Product received for free. System CPU AMD FX 6300GPU AMD RX 470RAM 16 GB 1333mhzLoading game off 7200 RPM Drive OS on SSD.The game runs really well displaying at 1920 HD. There is a little frame drop during high intensity moments but otherwise 60 fps pretty consistently.Multiplayer is easy to use but needs to be looked up about how it works on Google.
1;"""Anyone that says """"This is the worst MH ever made Ive played the game for thousands of hours on the other games"""". Is lying.This game has drastically improved annoying mechanics such as having to carry pickaxes and nets. It also adds some great mechanics such as vigorwasps and an eviroment that can be used against the monsters you hunt.Negatives Denuvo Motion Blur Mouse Acceleration Hard to do campaign mutiplayer (but regular quests work fine in mutiplayer)."""
1;It's basically Bloodborne 2we got doggo in rotten valegot the Hunter Axe Kirkhammer and Ludwig's Holy Blade in the form of the Charge blade and Switch AxeVaal Hazak is a Bloodborne bosswe got the Rifle Spear combined with the Stake Driver plus a giant shieldIt's like Bloodborne on pc
1;Good game for the Monster Hunter series very nice QoL from previous games. Assigned quests the story section of the game still contains the issue of having to watch a cutscene before others can join.Denuvo and some CPU/GPU/drivers will cause issues issues thankfully I have not experienced many issues except for an occassional freeze during monster animations after a very long play session.
1;"""Net interruption issues will be fixed. They were present at console launch as well. Game is meant to be played with a controller and it controls beautifully with one. These are the two main issues people are giving the game poor reviews for so this is one of those rare cases that I recommend you ignore the """"mixed"""" reviews rating and buy the game. It's AAAwesome."""
1;Good Game so far Pros Gameplay good. Optimization good. Runs perfect on 1080P on old rig. Okay story CatsCons Keyboard config. (players need to do a lot of tweaking to make it work) Servers are up and down. Overloaded with new players. No way to kill motion blur depth of field or mouse acceleration. few bugs with mice controls for gaming mice.
1;First Monster Hunter game I've played. I'd heard of them for years but never thought I'd be into them. Not sure how this compares to the others but I love this game. I mostly play singleplayer but will do multiplayer if I'm in the mood (rarely) so I haven't experienced any of the server issues peolpe are saying.
1;"""VERY FUN GAME!All the negative reviews say the game is awesome but there is a lot of connectivity issues. This is true. Playing multiplayer is death by menus.That being said once you get used to the multiplayer """"complexities"""" it's great. Some people have more connection problems than others and I've had good days and bad with connectivity.They'll fix it eventually. But the game itself is amazing."""
1;Probably DC'd only once since they patched the server issues after the first week and that was due to my own internet. Reviews are still mixed because of the r/MonsterHunter attack but if the server issues are the only thing preventing you from buying the game know it's a lot better now.
1;This game is kinda like to make you do smash crush rip tear all those monster you see.But not without one painful flaw that annoyed the heck out of me.A communication error occurred. Error code 83 mw1 What's this? I can't even played with my friend every single 10 minutes per battle . I had to kept making Sessions in order to do this and that. Thats annoying and tedious as hecking heck.Otherwise the game is excellent and a Recommended game. Plz fix this Connection Error problem.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter game and i really like it it's fun and has a lot of content to dive in but what is bad is the already known dissconection issues putting that aside it's a very solid port i honestly had my doubts about the performance but it runs really well on a low end pc that is a bit better than minimun specs.
1;Ok so me and my friend who is a major monster hunter fan have been waiting for this game for so daimn long this is my first monster hunter game and i really think it is one of the best games ive played i got it on day of release and i already have over 100 hours in it if you are thinking of buying this game do it. it is worth the money and so much more.I R8 A Solid 8/8 m8
1;some of the monsters are reskins sadly and some of them (lucky that its just a few) have outright broken moves and/or movesets this makes it really hard not to hate some t that comes thy way. but i still cant stop playing it... (update they call a horse an elder dragon...why even live at this point?) (call me bad at this game too if you wish but im just saying)
1;Gotta balance dem reviews.Yes there are problems but most are minor IMO and server problems will certainly be fixed.I mean c'mon guys at the time of this review the game wasn't even out for 2 weeks and it's not like we are playing on the old EUW servers from RIOT games.Also I used the potential fix from reddit and since then there are no problems with online play (which ofc doesn't excuse that the problem is there).
1;Better textures better online and better m/kb support would be nice but until that happens nothing is stopping me from beating a t rex into submission with a massive bagpipe made out of the bones of the unicorn I fought yesterday. That's fun that's what I play this game for. If the first three problems are dealbreakers for you then do as you will but if that second part sounds like your kind of time grab this game and join the hunt.
1;Framerate can be choppy multiplayer experiences frequent disconnects and there have been a couple bugs but the gameplay is still extremely solid. I have high hopes that Capcom will patch the game quickly and sort the most glaring issues out. It's a brilliant game and it'd be a shame to have it ruined by some bad missteps
1;I've prayed to the Lord and he hath sent a beautiful widescreen gem to me to finally play on the PC. I've easily poured 600 hours into the PSP titles. Im expecting a lot of mileage outta this baby. FPS ranges from low 50s occasionally but mostly 60 on a i7 6700 + 1070 on 2K.
1;10/10If you don't own it you're missing out.Blind playthrough Insect GlaiveJust beat Temepered Bazel fight )Amazing game.. first monster hunter and just an amazing experience.I'm now working on hunter rank to be able to get high rank temepered fights from elder dragons like Kirin for the best weps.
1;Actual Gameplay greatPC Controls not that bad some odd choicesOnline Connectivity pretty terrible inexplicably complicated grouping system bugsWhile a number of frustrating issues detract from the experience the core gameplay is so good that I would still whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone interested in a more deliberate action experience.
1;Hello. I've had this game on my Xbox one and it plays great on pc too. These connection errors though. Also I wish there was an option to skip cutscenes for people who have played the game already. As starting over because of no crossplay and having to go through the weird story limitations while playing with friends just takes out some of the fun factor. I also hoped they would have some nice exclusive contents for pc players too. More importantly CONNECTION ISSUES? WTFish? haha
1;This game is the most fun i've had in a while in gaming i LOVE this game.Slaying monsters with your friends is the best thing ever the amount of random conversations and that feel when u defeat a new boss AMAZING.The only issue i have with this game is that we sometimes have to remake the session cuz one of us won't be able to see it or DC from it as a whole.
1;This by far is one of the best games I have ever played. With the servers being pretty much fixed now I can undoubtedly give this a 9.5/10 only reason it loses the 0.5 is because I disagree with some of the cosmetic changes they chose to go through with from previous entries in the series. It's easy to pick up hard to put down and man is it satisfying to get that first big kill or get the weapon you've been grinding for. Super big thumbs up!
1;God this game is so fun. Im not sure what to say about it if you like hunting giant monsters and upgrading loot to go do it all again it very muich is the game for you. Lots of fun gear to upgrade to play with lots of good reasons to go out for just one more hunt.
1;This game is absolutley beautiful and so in depth some times its very fast paced as you're hunting a challenging monster other times it can be relaxing as you go on an expedition and just explore as you gather materials. It isn't bombarded with DLC everything is earned which is really appreciatied and theres definetly enough content that just keeps coming.
1;A step up in the standar for a monster hunter game and while it could use some more optimization for pc (let people join via steam for gods sake) The weapons feel much more fluid than previous titles. The only issues ive encountered are some online disconnects occasionally but otherwise its been fine so far in the 65 hours ive played it so far and Im willing to play more as it patched more and if new content is added.
1;The definitive Monster Hunter for now at least. Staggering amount of content amazing visuals satisfying gameplay Bear in mind it's quite resource intensive. It runs fine on my mid tier PC but I can hear the fan whirring like crazy within seconds of booting it up. It had heavy connectivity issues at launch but it's gradually stabilized in the time since then. Still get the occasional disconnect but almost never during actual hunts so it s a minor annoyance at worst.
1;This has quickly become one of my favorite games. Connectivity problems are there but they aren't game breaking for me or my friends. As a long time Monster Hunter fan I love the new direction the games took here. It's challenging and feels oddly like less RNG than previous entries. I've been enjoying every moment and haven't been feeling like I'm grinding my face against a rock. Can't wait for the new content we're getting in the future!
1;Played the hell out of it on PS4. Was great then.Still great now With a few issues.Online does work. But you can get disconnected randomly and have to recreate the room. Squads are gone. Which is pretty lame. No ability to create Friends only lobbies now.A lot of the graphics settings do not work but somehow cause performance hits. Restarting the game to change certain settings is also pretty dumb. Considering it is 2018.
1;R9 Fury X and 4690k this game is running great on Med high settings (only noticeable drop is from the rain).Mouse and keyboard controls surprisingly well.Biggest complaint at this point is the co op for story quests but I expect that to get fixed soon.
1;New to the series and having a blast! Initially tried using mouse and keyboard but found it inferior to a gamepad.Graphics sound is great. Playing at 4k with a 1070. Just make sure to turn some settings down.Gameplay is fantastic. Being new to the series wasn't sure what to expect but having a lot of fun.Haven't tried the multiplayer yet as I want to try all the monsters solo first.Quite surprised at the low rating on steam most definitely one of the better games I've played this year.
1;"""I wish the story will be more lengthy and more monsters are available in this version like as many in MH Frontiers hehehe.Overall its a good game. Haven't experienced any connection issues just sudden fps drops but the causes probably comes from my HDD """"."""
1;The game is not without network issues and related bugs but the core mechanics of the game work and the network is stable enough to play contently with friends. As a long time fan of Monster Hunter this is the game I've been wanting since I first started playing it on the PSP.
1;Fantastic intro game for new players into the Monster Hunter Series. It simplifies and streamlines many aspects of the series' mechanics that might have been otherwise tedious or kind of intimidating. Definitely the simplest Monster Hunter title but that's not necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. Especially considering it's attempting to garner a larger player base which I fully support.
1;Deep gameplay great visuals had some connectivity issues but it's now fixed.Might be the best game of 2018 even with keyboard + mouse )Of course after some time the grinding starts.... but game's worth about 100 hours of great fun... which is much more than most titles.
1;My first Monster Hunter because I have no console and I have to say great game with a bad net code (hope they fix that soon). After 150h ingame I still enjoy grinding for weapons/gear and trophys. The only thing I miss so far is a ice biom and there are to many monsters that are weak to thunder and only a few to fire....a bit imbalanced in my opinion. Still I can highly recommend it for every fan of the genre/series and hopfe for new monsters/content to come.
1;Not sure why there is tons of bad reviews i realy enjoy this game so far good music monster alot of cool wepons the only thing i disapoint is not much monster to hunt i want more monster i dont care if needed DLC i will buy it or this game gonna dead soon so far they buff monster into 2 difrent level Tempered and Arch Tempered (power/more powerfull) or updating few mosnter like (Deviljho / Kulve Taroth / Lunastra / Behemoth from Ffantasy) Extend the game life times.
1;Absolutely Amazing Game and easy to drown yourself into with the intricate weapons and addicting combat system. The mixed reviews were caused by only connection issues at launch in Aug 2018 but was fixed after a week. Free DLCs keep coming and the community is thriving so well. Most hours I clocked ever in a game and that's saying a lot. 11 STARS OUT OF 10.
1;except some connection bugs here are there everything else is good.Edit now that they fix the connection issues it's time go give this game a try if you are looking for a good co op game to farm with your friend while getting charge by black diblo over and over again while she eats cactus and after gets bomb rush by B52 bazel bomber and cart to camp
1;HAhahahahah.... 10/10 would slowly progress here than Dark Souls.Being a fan of the series it's a great game to introduce new players still be fun for veterans and be kind enough to casuals like me to want to clock in at least 4 hours a day. Get the game if you like to fight huge monsters and wear their corpses.
1;"""This is my very first Monster Hunter that i played and i have to say i love Monster Hunter World.Sure there are a few things which are """"unfair"""" but with all that great stuff you can explore or do you kinda forget these negative things very quickly.I RLY cant stop playing this game D"""
1;Guys let me say this about the game. This is a huge step up from MHGU with HD assets and with a few minor changes to the formula. Honestly I really enjoy this game more than any other game I have played in the last 14 Years. No other game has hooked me into playing so much that I almost live of this game. Not only is it a good refurbished game compared to the other MHs its also great for first time player in the series. Even though the price of this game is $62.05 USD Its worth the full price.
1;I really enjoy this game although I love the series in general so I was going to enjoy mhw either way.I haven't experienced any connectivity issues for weeks and with the camera fix for mouse users it feels wayyy better. A big QoL improvement would be to bind the quick item menu to 1 9 rather than having to press f1 then 1 9.If you enjoy killing monsters for armour so you can kill more monsters for more armour this is your game.
1;seriously the game is great but somehow the connection error is really getting annoying everytime when we are close to taking down something it usually pops up and practically takes the kill away from everyone within the grp. when the hell can a patch be available to fix this crap?!
1;Loving it! While the game has a very serious flaw in the 20+ year old tech used for the multiplayer once you learn to get around it it runs beautifully on high settings on an old ish budget rig the gameplay loop is really satisfying (if you're into grindy games and gear progression at least) and the game world while not supported by much of a story is designed well.All in all there are a couple of very poorly done elements to the game but I'm having way too much fun to care.
1;Can I play Co op? Sure but you'll might end up solo due to connection issues.Can I hunt tons of Monster? Yes either solo or Co op (which will ended up solo).What kind of pets can I have? A cat.DO you recommend it? Unless you like solo and you're fine playing solo most of the time then yes else you might wanna look up for another game or until they fix the connection issues.Also the PC version is folowing up with the console version. So you can think bout getting it now.
1;A great addition to my favourite game series of all time. The best mechanics to date and all the quality of life and presentation you would expect from a PC version of a previously handheld series. The only issue i have with it is that the late game is mediocre compared to previous titles such as Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate (though i'm hoping the upcoming Iceborn expansion fixes this).9/10 game but tempered monsters are artificial difficulty.
1;I've not experienced issues to the extent others have it's been pretty painless. Otherwise it's a fantastic MH game.The first week I got disconnected from the 2 MP attempts I tried.But now I play mostly online and never have problems with connectivity.
1;Through its early release multiplayer is almost like impossible to happen due to some network issues in the game and Steam. I am still getting occasional DCs but mostly I am doing fine. I'll be looking forward for the Iceborne Expansion of the game that was just recently announced. I hope that there will be a lot of updates this coming 2019.
1;Pros First day of HR go into SOS of dragon. Midway through hunt not one but TWO other dragons show up. Party wipes.Cons Fix yo damn servers.Update Server issues mostly fixed.It is P2P so some hunts are still laggy but thats once in a blue moon its 2018.
1;Soooo.. for those who gave it a negative review and said would change the review when the connecting issue and mouse optimization were fixed have you guys done soo?Other than that the game runs smoothly.......WITH the EXCEPTION of when your stunned and your palico comes to you thinking thats it gonna hit you but nooo it just comes to you to drink a potion.
1;Great co op MMORPG. Great action combat. 10/10 would slay the big monsters again.Experienced no PC keybinding issues or connection issues. You play for the combat the graphics/cinematics and the gameplay. You prep hunts grind monsters upgrade armor rinse and repeat. The story is paper thin and it gets tedious at times like doing dailies in WoW but you can mod that part out. Don't be afraid to change weapons. It can make the game feel new again.
1;Played a bit. Its a good game. Despite the issues the game is still a good buy.Points of Interest Core gameplay is great nothing to complain there. Connection/Server issues on Capcom's side are a huge problem they needed that fixed last week. Denuvo possibly to blame for this. Game could've used an Open Beta test to iron out these issues. Menu system is garbage could've used PC style menus and a better quality UI.
1;Product received for free. I bought this game on my PS4 year ago and I got it free when I upgrade my rig. This game is bored but when you have friends that do the hunt together it multiplies the fun for 100x.Play this game and all your free time is consumed
1;You know what time is it? Itssss review timeeeeeeeeeee!!played old MH(MH 3rd portable &amp freedom unite) for about 1000+ hours and this one is the best so far. combat is preety amazing decent graphics * * . The only complaint I have about this game is the targeting system it is really really bad I hope they fix it in future other than that game is mofkn amazing!! and its more fun to play with friends/ random hunters but hey playing solo is actually quite fun too. no regrets Money well spent D
1;Very fun game. Brings back memories of the previous games that I used to play on my old 3ds system. Not to mention that it runs really smoothly and the keyboard controls are not that hard to get used to. I'm assuming that other reviews that keep complaining about game performance just have crappy computers and need to get ones that can actually handle a game like this.
1;yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss9/10if you liked the monster hutner franchise or interested in starting on one this is one of your best choicesome crash here and there if the settings exceeed your spec and such but overallgrinddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd and enjoy
1;The more you get to know the game the more addictive it becomes. The combat is quite satisfying once you've learnt how to use weapons properly the monsters are also well designed despite still having some dumb happening at times. Though the grinding part of the game might get tedious at some point but overall a great game would recommend.
1;"""I had read it had some porting issues but since I didn't pick it up until the Autumn Sale that wasn't a problem for me. I am enjoying this game quite a bit. The graphics are great and the game is polished """"kill monsters to get more stuff to kill more monsters """" which I can enjoy for sheer mindless fun.My only material complaint is that you can't save your custom quick select circles for more than a mission before they revert to default. Boo!"""
1;I flat out love this game. Personally I have not experienced any issues.I have played monster hunter for around 10 years in various forms and this is a beautiful game to me.certainly some peoples expectations are a lot higher than mine and yes there have been issues for some. The networking issue is easily fixed you just have to look up how.back to the hunt.
1;Dont pay attention to bad reviews even when u get network errors and other stuff the game itself is beautiful smooth and perfect for sure they will fix the issues but still this game is well optimized for all MH fans this game is just what we where waiting for!I preordered it and cant be more happy.
1;multiplayer options are poopy right now because of game's recent launch.everything is good minus the artificial difficulty (i.e. having to put your weapon away to sharpen it having to put your weapon away to drink potions and many other poor design choices that make the game harder than it really needs to be.) otherwise good
1;Never played MH game before and this blow me away. Updated my review after clocking 100+ hours. I am enjoying every bit of it. Luckily i have a rig which runs at 60fps with all settings high so no issues with performance.Give Hammer a try its OP with less combos but awesome moveset and high damage.My Experience 10/10.Let the hunt begin . . .
1;Although there are a few issues with Online I would still call this (by a large margin nontheless) my favorite Monster Hunter game. From MH4U to MHGen to MHXX this just brings so many QoL changes and just plain amazing new aspects which make the others pale in comparison. Now we just need Online fixed Pickle to come over and G rank for this to be nearly perfect!This is probably my 5th favorite game at this time. I'd give it an 8/10 (10/10 when online is fixed)
1;ive played 50+ hours so far never had a promblem beside lunch day with playing anyone i love this game its one of the best game made this year i have over 500 hours on xbox hr rank plus 350 on xbox and first monster hunter ever and its hands down a 10/10 game
1;I meet all the requirements for this game I have the lowest possible settings and yet it still doesn't work. It seems to hover around the 10 frames per second mark and is incredibly slow. Bummer... but I did hear about the patch that'll hopefully fix this so I'm ready to play whenever that comes out.
1;Fantastic game. Game of the year for me logged 127 hours in 3 weeks don't do that btw take the game slow I ruined my full experience got hunter rank 100 that amount of hours played it way to fast but great game all around the servers are a bit iffy right now as I review but they are sure to be fixed seem you can't connect to people early in the morning where I live in est time zone worth your money for sure be ready to grind your butt off
1;This deserve a GOTY. Even though this is by far the easiest MH title in history and the story final boss is literally a sandbag it is still great to see MH finally releasing PC HD title. Anyone who are willing to take on a challenge and learn their way to a victory should definitely try this game out.
1;I played Monster Hunter 2 and loved it. This game is a little tough to learn but that adds to the enjoyment. PROS Able to hunt monsters. Able to hunt monsters with friends (when you figure out how to decently connect to other people) New Gear Tons of Collectables 14 main weapons to choose from. Cool Cat who aids you. (can customize him too) Seeing monsters engage with other monstersCones Quit whinning and enjoy the game. Rave
1;ive only just begun this game and so far i love it. from the creatures the characters to the weapons. its a game i can easily find myself sinking ours into. the only problem that I do have with the game is that there is no regular jumping machanic. other than that great game.
1;very good as im one of the fan since 1st MH love this game as until now with my friends. love it a lot. dont mind about the negative commend if you want to complaint should upgrade your PC before that and for connection problem it always happened since it just 3 days release what u expect? everything perfect? its good as long as they will release new update to solve this anywa GOGOGOO MHW!!!!
1;"""Port is not the best but it works. Some kinks need to be worked out but the gameplay is what really gets you. Give this game a try! It has mixed reviews atm but honestly it's just because it doesn't support 21 9 aspect ratio and having """"low"""" fps when in highest settings when Volume Rendering Quality isn't OFF. The core gameplay is really good whether you're playing solo or with your friends."""
1;An amazing agme that i recomend with my hearth i start playing since the PSP and i have to admit is just gold to me.Rework the monster graphics and implement new mechanics made the game really cool just a tipGet an xbox one or ps4 control or you will struggle with the controls if youre new just dont get youre self down if you fail a quest is normal an more if youre new on seriesnow get out and hunt '3
1;Monster Hunter on PC what more do I need to say pit's great fun has lots of QOL changes and is just the best one to jump into the series with. The PC port could be better have had a few random crashes fps drops on some Elder Dragons and don't see much point in Denuvo on an online game like this I guess some people would play it solo but it only hurts the rest of us paying customers hopefully they remove it down the road (yeah I doubt they will)
1;Don't listen to the negative reviews people are salty they were having disconnection issues which for the most part at this point are resolved. If I didn't need to pay rent I would literally play this game non stop. I already plugged 100 hours on PS4 and this version is much better due to quicker load times better textures and it just feels damn good to play with keyboard and mouse. A welcome addition to the MH franchise.No you do not need to play previous games in the series.
1;This is my first review because I couldn't help but recommend this game I preordered the deluxe version especially since as a long time MH fan (played since the first one on PS2 at 2005) it is a dream come true to play it on the PC especially this REALLY polished port.Now there were some inconveniences at launch like FPS drops and server issues but as of today it works great.I lost all of my friends to this.
1;The game is fairly ported to PC. With some issues here and there. The worst thing was the disconnection issue which was improved 2 days ago. If you like this game on the consoles you will love it as well. for me I can get more than what the consoles do such as more FPS and mods.
1;Its amazing game People are crying about connection issues they dont know when the game was released on PS4 we had to play whole story solo because of connection issues It took month to fix the problem.PC people just want stable build since day 1 .Other than that game is stable runs amazing and pretty fun.
1;You'll understand how to play in about five hours and become decent near the ten hour mark but continue and you'll have hundreds of hours of gameplay and then the gameplay of the other incredible (though clunkier) Monster Hunter games. Which have upwards of three times the monsters. And hundreds more weapons. And hundreds more armor sets. There is a LOT but do not fear for Monster Hunter quantity is not without quality.
1;Alot of people complaining about some small problems which will most likely get resolved in the future the game itself is a blast and I am having alot of fun I normally don't review games but I couldn't stand the game having a mixed rating it does not deserve that at all.
1;I played this game when i first came out and was anticipating ther PC release once i got my hand on the game i fell in love with the game again and havent stopped playing. they have released a very good port and done a great job westernising the game and is a great game for beginners to the series.
1;If you love solo games and also don't mind having a bit of help at times this is the perfect game for you. I've been playing Monster Hunter from my younger college years and never have been disappointed. It's easy to learn and pickup new weapons and figure out tricks. There is a lot of hidden detail around the game and it makes it feel like a treasure hunt sometimes. Try it out!
1;If you are looking for a challenging monster hunting coop game that makes farming items seem fun then this is the game for you. There are plenty of criticisms of this game by PC gamers but there has been indication from the devs that improvments to some concerns are on the way. This is truly the nicest looking and most fun version of monster hunter I have played and that is why I couldn't recommend this game more.
1;Don't call it a comebackI've been here for yearsI'm rocking my peersPuttin' suckers in fearMakin' the tears rain down like a monsoonListen to the bass go boomExplosions overpowerin'Over the competition I'm towerin'Wrecking shop when I write these lyricsThat'll make you call the copsDon't you dare stare you better moveDon't ever compareMe to the rest that'll all get sliced and dicedCompetition's payin' the priceI'm gonna knock you outMama said knock you outHammer experience in a nutshell.
1;A must buy! Well worth the price.As a single player game it is Great.As a Co op Multiplayer it is Best.Network Errors are a problem but has been acknowledgedMinor nuisance not deserving of negative reviews.9/10 for now10/10 once Network Errors are fixed
1;So 69 hours in... since most of the reviews have been on the connection errors and the bad console port imma say this The game is fun.I have fun playing it.It feels nostalgic on one hand but also completely refreshing on the other.So since the purpose of a game should be having fun you should try it.(Maybe imma write a more in depth review at 420 hours in)
1;The core game is so amazing that it really makes you look past the issues here and there however get used to seeingError 50382 MW1 Want to open the gane? Wait 5 min for it toconnect only to tell you its offline. Error 50382 MW1 Want to play multiplayer? Error 50382 MW1 Almost finished a monster in multi? Error 50382 MW1 Looked as the game funny. Error 50382 MW1 Capcom CEO sneezed. Error 50382 MW1
1;No Plesioth 10/10 recommendedHonestly though it could be a lot betterFirst and foremost the network errors. Fix ASAP.Mouse controls seem to be under works I play with a controller but some people still prefer mouse and keyboard so I guess it's a good thing they're trying to fix that.Textures please fix fix fix. Game looks ugly despite its demanding specs.Xenojiva game breaking bug. Please at least fix this if you're gonna hope that this game gets more than 60% on steam after bug fixes.
1;Since they've got at least one patch out the door addressing the connection issues I'll go ahead and write my positive review It's Monster Hunter the best video game series ever except you can play it on PC. If you aren't playing this game you are stupid
1;Multiplayer has some bugs atm yes however single player works 100%. Ignore the rage even if the game was perfect some people they would probably find something to complain about anyway. The game is a lot of fun and worth trying especially multiplayer (if you get it to work )
1;Many may say this game is hard this game has bag connection bla bla bla.....SHUT UP NOOBIf u think this is a bad game or too hard for u noob try monster hunter 3 portable on a phone beat to the last boss then u may come back here and maybe just maybe u can like or dislike MONSTER HUNTER WORLD ultil then SHUT UP AND GIVE THIS GAME A CHANGE AND A LIKE.
1;Best Monster Hunter to date. The only thing that is hurting it in my mind is the MP connection issues. There are work arounds to it so it isn't a deal breaker but annoying nontheless. The handling of coop could of been better. Highly recommend this game especually to fans of the franchise.
1;Game works fine even on a 2011 PC like mine AMD Phenom II x6. Does not require SSE4.1 so runs fine on chipsets unprovided of such functionality. Game runs well even on a GTX 1050ti OC between 30 to 60 fps on medium settings.I do hope there might be some better optimisation to get better fps for medium Graphic Cards.Overall its a game that will grant easily 200h+ of gameplay enjoyement.
1;Don't get confused with the negative reviews!This is a great game and I never had issues with it.I am playing with my friends online and with thelatest patch I never had connection issues.Moreoever the game perfectly runs and it nevercrashed at all with my game time 379 hours!This is truly a wonderful online game and I defitenlyrecommend to buy and play this game!Cheers!
1;"""Soooo.. steam shortcut Target """"C Program Files (x86) Steam Steam.exe"""" nofriendsui tcpEnjoy multiplayer as it seems to be steams lovely new UI that is causing disconnects Once we did this we are able to enjoy hours of co op on end we """"Dropped connection"""" to the match making session but we remained in the same online session and could continue without any further issues. Thanks steam"""
1;This game is my sort of game i love the grinding and the graphics on highest is sick.I dont like the people that hate this game is perfect the connection errors are the problem sometimes but Capcom are looking at it right now so chill... i love this game anyway )i rate this game 10/10
1;Really enjoying this game. This is my first monster hunter I play solo and have not experience any issues. I understand there are multiplayer issues but as a solo player it does not impact me. Great game and I hope more monster hunter games come out on PC.
1;i was already a fan of this series since mhf2 and this game has been my dream for many years...now it's here and even with my unrealistic expectations it didn't disappoint.EDIT continuous crashes in very important parts of missions drops of framerate w/ gtx 1070 ti...you get the idea its frustrating but it's still a great game.EDIT it seems the crashes have stopped for good! thank the gods at capcom.
1;Since i was in middle school i really enjoy monster hunter now with this MHW i really love it after 75 hours play this game is amazing after the update now we can enjoy real hunting with friend. Amazing gameplay amazing grinding and amazing time. can't wait for another update and new monster.
1;If you come from the older Monster Hunter games you will definitely like this. Most negative reviews come from connectivity issues and people complaining about graphic options and getting motion sickness. Well almost every AAA game has terrible connectivity issues even weeks after launch and the graphics are so much better if you compare to handhelds like PSP and 3DS where I come from. To me it plays like any other 3rd person game so maybe you are just weak .
1;As a player with over 8000+ hours in Playstation 2 PSP WII U in Monster Hunter games. The whiny negative reviewers are just that. I've waited 12 years since the first monster hunter ever to have a PC control game because I hate consoles. AND FINALLY I HAVE ONE.AND THE PCCONTROLSARE GOODTo the whiney console morons you're all trash and you can suck on the eiffel tower for giving this game a bad review. The world deserves better than your existence.
1;I saw Mon Hun I came. I played no regrets. I only wrote a review because this game while simpler than previous iterations of the franchise with many QoL changes is still an absolute gem. The end gamrle may be a bit confusing and tedious but it's still gorgeous.
1;I almost have 100 hours on this amazing game and it is truly amazing but i dont understand people giving this game a bad review since they can't run the game or just dont like it for simple things i absolutely love this game and my experience has been top notch multiplayer does have some issues but it from those hosting. Do not give this great game a bad review for simple things that trigger you.
1;If you like salt this is the perfect game for you if you dont like salt play some battle royale game and come back. Positive aspects bad team mates wierd hitbox bad optimisation best waifu handlerNegative aspetcs japanese team mates that make the game too easy korean dudes that speedrun the mission you post Dungpods the game makes you hurt Dodogama... NO ONE WANTS TO HURT A DODOGAMA!
1;Alot of the negative reviews are based on people with toasters who can't run the game properly. Definitely a gem of a game and the port is better than most ports from japan. Nice fluid combat mechanics the story is so so but the gameplay is what makes this game superior to similar style games. If you can run it definitely worth your time.
1;To all the people on this game. Your levels of ornery bs are so ing stupid its killing me. The bugs are minor. The learning curve is way more tiny than thousands of other games you nerds butt with good reviews like dark souls. Like jfc get past zorah play the actual content mh has always been a late game type of game. Yes the story sucks NEWS FLASH it always has. Wanting to butcher the handler is a natural and completely understandable offense.
1;Edited Review A lot of fixes applied the last few weeks. Game is now running on my current hardware fairly well. Still some odd issues such as long launch times and freezing if I remove / add USB devices but otherwise a solid addition to the Monster Hunter franchise at this point.
1;Even if there are currently connection issues it's still one of the most fun and satisfying games I've played for a very long time. It's going to be 100% worth it to be patient. Just be glad you're not on console and it only takes 15 seconds to connect to a new session instead of minutes.
1;After the changes to the networking and some tinkering with settings using a program called NvidiaInspector which I would highly reccomend to anyone using nvidia cards especially to those who have trouble with rotten vale framerates the game now sits at a solid framerate everywhere for me. That asside this is by far the easiest game on newcommers to the series so if youve ever wanted to get into the monhun series this would be the one to do it.
1;Great games where you can sink a ton of hours into. The controls are streamlines compared to the older games and the gameplay is much faster. Totally worth it if you enjoy these type of games. Dont go expecting a killer story but if you like challenging games with a lot of grinding then this game is for you. Now we have to wait for the updates.
1;Game had some major issues when it came out but was still playable. In less than a month they have fixed almost all the major issues (connectivity and mouse control). The only thing they haven't fixed 100% is some of the textures in PC but they are almost unnoticeable.
1;I have played on PS4 then on PC.It is a great monster hunting game and I recommend it.The gameplay is satisfying and the graphics are modern despite the game being greedy CPU and GPU wise.If I had to say something negative about it it would be more about the genre.This kind of game becomes repetitive after a few dozens hours and the enjoyment is slowly traded for completionism.
1;500+h on Console and now 100h on PC still cant get enough if you run out of things too do in this game you still can tryout a new Weapon witch can chance your game experience.Its an unforgettable adventure witch brought me and maybe many other people into the MonsterHunter series.
1;Just going to put this out there. First game in a long time I feel I can devote many hours to. More content being added. Community is active in trying to make harder content. All in all a solid game that is released not in alpha state for once. Worth the money.
1;Networking deficiencies and hardware issues aside Monster Hunter World truly offers an experience that is both unique and satisfying. This game has consumed my life for the month of August leaving me with little desire to play anything else. If boss battles are your thing then look no further.
1;It's been said before but if you played Dark Souls and wished every fight was a boss fight this is the game for you. Oh and the connectivity issues have been 90% resolved so you can actually play with others now.100 hours played at the time of writing.
1;Great game most of the issues regarding online connection are resolved now it's only some frame drop issues left to solve. This game is great higly addictive and super fun wether you play solo or in a group. There's so much depth to the weapons monster gameplay that you might have to figure out yourself or look up online. But for me exploring and discovering things are part of the monster hunter experience happy hunting!
1;I originally wasn't happy with this game and it's multiplayer connectivity issues. However this has since been resolved and I have had several long gaming sessions without a single drop out occurring. I've put over 150 hours into the game (incorrect on Steam due to some offline play) but I'd rate this game the highest I can.
1;Currently got 105 hours on this and I've loved every single one. A very skill based game and at time of review it seems to be running to where I experience few to no disconnects from online and have a very good time finding or playing with other people when I desire.
1;"""""""Why delay the game more than half a year and not actually prepare for the release? The servers are always down so it's impossible to play with other humans. What a garbage port.""""That WAS my review before they fixed the servers so you can play multiplayer properly. Pretty good game 3"""
1;The kind of game that make your hands wet from sweat. Every fight is intense and feels like boss battle. Fluid animation good level design decent difficulty and a unique game on its own. Although PC port and its multiplayer is a bit unstable you will forget all of them when playing the game.Is good wether you are casual or hardcore. Great to play on single player or with friends.
1;Great Game! And Who care about network issues!?I'M A SOLO HUNTER SINCE MH2!!*EDIT 20/09/2018 Now that's network problems are gone.I'm make it to the end game and still recommended it.currently the end game don't have much to offer but it still fun doing a couple of hunts per day.
1;this game is fun to pop into random SOS quests and just kill monsters but shines at its best when in a discord with friends having a blast please keep in mind that pc updates come later because capcom isnt used to pc but the updates a re coming i highly recommend 10/10
1;Dont listen to the bad reviews. This game is so amazing ive played alot of games in my time and this is some quality that shouldnt be overlooked. Yes is has a few minor bugs and can be confusing to grasp but once you do its legendary. If you are a little baby i recommend this game. )
1;Game is a fun multiplayer experience. Solo isn't so great but it's playable. Had some issues at first with connectivity and some minor fps issues but they released a patch fixing the 50382 MW1 error (As of August 26 I haven't encountered this error ever again) and are currently working on further PC optimisation so that's good. Overall this isn't as bad as a port as everyone is making it out to be.It's still a better port than Mighty Number 9 anyways.
1;Haven't had this many issues staying connected to a lobby since For Honor hopefully they fix it because it IS a fun game.And here I thought they delayed it so they can give us a good port from the get go.EDIT They have now addressed the connection issues that I initially disliked about the game. You can now enjoy getting pummeled by bagel goose with your friends would recommend.
1;The game is now a superior port in every way thanks to them actually fixing the network issues other than the fact we're behind in updates like Deviljho etcAlso use mods like Transmog armor if you don't want to look like a clown just because you want a specific build.
1;This game is amazing!! It is the boss fight game! So much action and so much to do. Loads of weapons to choose from and the gear sets are unique. The monsters are challenging yet fun to fight. One of my favourite games by far. It may have some frame drops during a couple battles but overall the gameplay and vast amount of things to do deserves a thumbs up.
1;Finally on PC!not limited to the 3DS runs super smooth and makes a ton of fun alot that helps out if your new to the game and helps you with collecting ressources its Monster Hunter how you love it it feels like it and plays like it with the taste of a helping hand which feels fine by me short in short i can fully recomment it.&lt 3
1;My very first Monster Hunter Game I'm actually impressed by the variety of weapons and possible different playstyles. Every weapon also seems to be used by players there ain't a single weapon that seems entirely pointless. Having lot of fun with the game so far playing online works pretty good at this point aswell can recommend.
1;The monster hitboxes are and the internet connection thing must be fixed this is an online game its frustrating and stupid to go alone against strong monsters in early mid game.Ofc the game is really beautifull and all but those are issues that need to be fixed fast.
1;The whole game aspect r rock solid for both new and veteran hunter like. Still hopping on multiplayer session are near impossible and incosistent as welll (the SOS/riin choice r too few for a game that has 150k+++ average population)Update The whole mp session is still got up and down but at least i could play properly with my brother today. Also the game has UNOFICIAL TRANSMOG MOD!!!! HUZAAAAAHHHH
1;Great game but don't buy until the network error is fixed. I'm getting disconnected from other players 2/3 times then you get left with a 4 player scaled monster solo. Optimisation is really really bad as well if that's a concern for others ). When fixed I'll change to recommended**Edit seems like some of the disconnection problems are happening a lot less now (still a few occasionally) so it's playable now. Optimisation is a concern but otherwise amazing game.
1;I've played 200 hours on PS4 and I still buy this just to play with my friends. And guess what? The thing I bought this version for doesn't works! I can't even go to the same session as my friends not even trying to go for any quests yet.Will not recommend this game until Steam/Capcom fix this issue.Edit The connection issue occurs less now.
1;the network connect error is freaking annoying where we are losing our patient to play it although it has been long await. if you dont mind to play it sololy .... frequent disconnect ... unable to detect friends online ... then this is your choice.__________________________________________________________________________Recently fixed 95% connection error i remain my previous comment as it was reacting slow onto problems.
1;Not the best monster hunter (yet)but not bad for PC port.Still need a lot of improvement in terms of graphics and performanceI am running 1080p resolution with GTX 1070Ti the FPS drops to 40 on Jungle area.Other than that they fixed (80% safe) of the network issue Yes this is for casual monster hunter.
1;Really awesome after a month after the game release. Almost all issues are fixed.If you are having disconnections issues still and have done all the dmz portforwarding and etc...Try the cloudflare dns 1.1.1.1 and secondary 1.0.0.1And to people that say that people dont change their review. Well here I am I changed my review.
1;OK This games great however be prepared to spend 26 hours trying to get a specific item because sometimes it happens. Also the hitboxes are a little janked up. The story's also pretty mediocre. BUT BUT BUT the game is still fun the combats fun and when has a monster hunter game ever had a good story? its just fun Idk what to say.
1;Well it is a good game on ps4 but porting it to pc has more problems like frequently dc after several quest together. Tbh example like re6 capcom product has the most connectivity issue. Which i do presume it is because the data record we played is linked to the capcom server. They really need fix this But about the game itself im surely don't have to explain myself. The title already explains what this game is. Even some people called it jurassic park rpg lul
1;I am a bit biased because I am already a fan of the Monster Hunter series but so far this game is amazing. Tons of little quality of life improvement from previous titles that make the game feel really slick and complete.Pretty graphics fun combat interesting new mechanics. Running a solid 60fps at max settings.The only cons I can think of are no ultrawide support poor mouse+kb support and some slightly lacking graphics options.
1;With the fixed netcode the core game of MHW is great.The only negatives that come to mind are issues with graphic drivers (I had to rollback to Nvidia 398.82 avoid crashes have been crash free since). And a lack of toggles for certain options such as DoF (you can minimize the DoF by turning off the volumetric fog but that sucks if you like the effect the volumetric fog brings).
1;I had fun with this game compare to other Monster Hunter it is easier to get into but still require online research to learn to play. It can be played on Mouse and Keyboard but I just like Xbox Controller. The bad news is that the pc game isn't updated or focused like it's console siblings. It feels like we are second class cilizens but I still recommend this game for anyone who like Challenging Solo/Co op Boss fights.
1;After a long awaited return Monster Hunter is finally on PC again. Most people here are putting up things on network issues and yes matchmaking could be a hell of allot better but that does not take away that it is a solid fun game. If you like Souls type games then welcome as this would be it's father.
1;OMG guys this is litterally the best game i have ever played but like the game just came out and there is one problem it disconnects me from the game every now and then LIKE OMG its not like it has only been out a week and this is there first monster hunter GAME on pc lol. Are people really that stupid?
1;First thing first the game is running on high fairly old rig (2 years old) no issues and fluid gameplay at 1080p.It's a polished eye pleasing and new player friendly monster hunter game heavily multiplayer oriented but still fully enjoyable by lone wolf hunters expecting to solo high rank monsters while wearing nothing more than their underwear.A solid 9 out of 10 in my opinion with gorgeous graphics and music. The gameplay is a matter of personal preference but I quite like it.
1;The latest PC patches No more unresonable disconnects never happens now after recent fixes Motion blur can be toggled Mouse movement support Better Optimisation (somewhat) Skippable cutscenes Lots of Bug fixesLack of content in terms of an entire MHW title as a whole. But it hasn't even been an year yet since release something that MHW team will take notice and possibly include a stronger endgame mechanic(s).
1;It's a great game with a mediocre port at best. The port could really improve (HD texture pack better controls for items and performance increases).Other than that multiplayer works (for me and my friends and all the SOS I did up to now) barely any bugs. Can't share a lot of problems others have.Also runs at around 80 100 fps on 2560x1440 resolution with almost maxed settings so that also works quite well for me.
1;Experienced some connection issues in online play though they are usually resolved pretty easily. Not as bad as many reviews make it out to be. Runs at stable 50 60 fps on high with my 1070 and i5 8400. Having friends to play this game with is a must to get the optimal experience.
1;The game has been made to include more beginners and causal players to play. The mechanics or the game would say around 3/5 for this port as some of the control were not thoguhtful considered from controllers to keyboard. They have fix the screen resize bug that causes the game to crash. However the game still occansionally encounters network communication error when playing in multiplayer.
1;"""Error 5028f mw1This is not acceptable for a full priced game that was delayed for over a year in order to be fully """"Optimized for PC play"""".Buy when price drops or network bugs are fixed.EDIT I believe connectivity issues have been addressed. Game gud now x"""
1;"""should rename it to """"everything is an simulator"""" or """"a million ways to die""""i can guarantee that you're going to get chained or one shotted by the most unbelievable setups possible ranging from airstrikes toads wasps and your own cattl dr mhw streamlines a lot of the tedium from the it's predecessors allowing for the more relevant gameplay of actually hitting on monsters"""
1;This is honestly one of my single favorite games there are some issues with the online mode and such but overall the game is amazing. I love playing this and just finished it recently so I am going through all of the optional quests and even after beating these monsters multiple times before I still have fun using one of the many different types of weapons each time and using abilities and combos that go along with them
1;It has all the crappy stuff from the PS4 (Like not being able to play the campain co op untill both players have seen the cutscene to that mission) but like 99% of the crappy PC stuff (Like not being able to get online and costant dicconects) are all fixed.So buy this game and go bash a pickle.
1;ed up mouse controls and weird bindings special attack is stuck connected to the interact/harvest/speak keys which should not be linked together. Disconnects from the server.They fixed the disconnects and the mouse controls. Key bindings are still not as good as you'd want for a PC title but they're fixing the ed up
1;Personally I haven't encountered TOO many connection issues. Sometimes I will disconnect from online services at random intervals but it doesn't affect my single player experience so I'm not too fussed. Other than these connection issues the gameplay and graphics are very good and it's an enjoyable game. Love the turf wars between monsters.
1;This Game is Fun STORY very mediocre in terms of actual story but its there first time making cutscenes for a story so whatever GAMEPLAY Very fun because there are a massive amount of playstylesCool crossovers like Final Fantasy Behemoth fight that forces more mmo style playAddictingYou feel powerful when you use the heavy weapons such as the Hammer (my main weapon)Large difficulty spike that can make things really hard such as Nergigante Overall I give this game 8.2/10
1;21 hours in game already i just bought this recently. This game has been eating my time. Last MH game i played was on the PSP so i can say im familiar about the game except for the new features since. I can say its a lil bit easier than previous games. I havent touched Multiplayer yet im gonna try solo first ( Currently on Rathian/Diablos Quest). The game is Hardware heavy so check youtube first for Performance of your system. Good buy for me.
1;"""*New review (thumbs up) The issues I had were fixed and now its working fine.*Old review* (thumbs down)Crashes and constant """"MW1"""" disconnects makes this a somewhat painful experience. I currently don't recommend this game till they sort that out... oh and I'm also having fps issues which shouldn't happen"""
1;very cool and fantastic game really really fun to play tons to explore fun to grind ( with friends ) .the multiplayer got kinda lots of problem atm kinda ruin the experience playing with friends but those are just temp prob .the game just got realease on pc even after the 9 month dev the MHW team still new to pc port . so just them a chance the multiplayer connection is getting smooth as i post this review. good game fun game no regret just come buy it . its a must play PC game .
1;As a veteran Monster Hunter player (since Freedom Unite) I can say that this entry is one of if not the best in the series. There is much more freedom than previous titles as well as no loading screens between the areas of the map. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do either single player or co op. This game does have a learning curve but it is an amazing feeling taking down a monster that was giving you trouble.
1;"""""""A communication error has occurred""""You're going to be getting this message a lot of the time even if you are the only person in your own online session.Edit The kinda fixed it after close to two weeks later. You'll still disconnect once in a while but it's definitely more manageable. I've had disconnects once every 6 hours pretty much so regular players won't have issues anymore."""
1;Played Monster Hunters Tri years ago on the Wii. There's a large learning curve but it's worth it. You'll have to play around with the graphic settings since it's a resource demanding game. I lose network connection once in a while but it might be because I'm connected using Wifi. The game will switch to offline mode so you don't lose your progress. This game is a lot of fun. Recommended.
1;"""Review has been modified and is now recommended as long as whoever is looking to buy the game is able to cope with these issues Cannot change specific graphical options (motion blur DOF bloom) Unoptimized performance no SLI support lack of ultrawide support (can be corrected with mods just not """"perfectly"""") texture rendering bugs simulated joystick with mouse and keyboard controlsIt's not a perfect experience but it's better than nothing."""
1;"""Don't take my """"recommendation"""" at face value I'm only reflecting my personal experience which has been fine. But as you've no doubt seen many others have been facing serious issues trying to play this game.I truly recommend the game itself but it's disheartening to see a new audience being put through all this. If you must play the console version instead. But that in turn will be playing right into Sony's hands.I love this game. But I'm saddened by everything surrounding it."""
1;3.6 hours into my pc playthrough I have to say zero complaints. I havent had any issues no pixelation no dc's no control issues. Maybe people are playing on potatoes? Obviously its a port from console so use a controller if you hate mouse acceleration. The first game I havent slammed on PC. Woot woot back to the hunt yo.
1;I bought this game to play with my friends since that was MHW is a naturally hard game. But little did I know how BAD the disconnections me and my friends has experienced and STILL CURRENTLY experiencing. such a huge disappointment. oni my 17hrs of playing i feel like 10hrs of this is just us desperately trying to play mhw with each other.EDIT Disconnections are now on a minimum. It is atleast playable
1;It's a bad port with all the things we've come to expect from a bad port sadly. Not remotely worth the 8 month delay we got.That being said the game itself is AWESOME. I've been having a blast while playing it so far. Definitely a must buy for any action/fantasy fan if you can look past it's bad port problems. 27 hours played and I have a feeling I'll easily reach 200 before I even think of getting bored with this game.
1;As a Monster Hunter fan from the PSP / PS2 era this port is amazing as far as gameplay.I do recommend holding off until they fix some of their port issues as it is sending everyone away. Once they fix matchmaking / mouse acceleration / graphical issues / keybinding this will be 10/10 for sure.
1;Xeno'jivan bug is t. Most of the complaints aside from the multiplayer crashing and disconnects are t. The only issue I have with the game is how easy it seems to be for people to hack. I haven't run into any hackers that I am aware of though. The game is great. I love it. I wish the Mouse keyboard support was better but this is about par for the course for JP ports of a game to PC.
1;Monster Hunter World is an amazing addition to the Monster Hunter franchise. The gameplay is solid and provides 100s of hours of entertainment. Plenty to do with the current release once you get through the story and with free updates planned for the next several months it will keep on giving.
1;It's monster hunter... if you like monster hunter you'll like this. I've got a pretty good PC and haven't done a lot of multiplayer so I've avoided a lot of the launch issues which probably helps my opinion. The only weird issue I've run into so far is occasional crashes when alt tabbing. For everyone else it'll be really great if the port is cleaned up.Edit I've done a fair amount of random multiplayer now and have had fairly few disconnects when joining hunts.
1;I can easily recommend this game absoultely love Monster Hunter sure it has a few game play designes that make Multiplayer a bit of a pain if you ain't used to it with the story cut scenes and there has been a few connection issues in its first few days but other than that its a good port of the Console version runs super well for me at least I'd put nearly 28 hours into this game by the time it had beeen out about 35 hours.... so that goes to show how much I've been enjoying it again.
1;Been playing since release here's my thoughts If you do not own any other platforms to play this game then buy it it's an amazing experience it has so much depth and things to master all the different weapon types feel unique. The issues are kinda annoying but not a deal breaker to me and don't really detract from the experience. But if you have other consoles to buy the game for just play on them right now they are the superior ecperience.
1;I love the game and have been waiting since release but the network issues are game breaking for me as I play a lot with friends. They patched a fix but I highly doubt that it fixed the issue as I still get disconnected a lot. A lot of textures in this game is also ugly.Gameplay wise it is really good.EDIT Since the recent updates I no longer encounter the network issues. I don't remember getting disconnected at all anymore.
1;Update The game has been updated and I've not had any disconects since then. So I don't really have anything significantly negative to say anymore.Update 2 The content updates really don't feel like they're coming out quick enough at all.300 hours on xbox nearly another 100 here and I still feel like there's a lot more mileage in this one.Make sure you're PC is powerful enough I have a 4970k and a 970 and it runs decent(ish).
1;Monster Hunter World is an amazing game on PC. It seems to be repetitive but it is repetitive with quality. Game itself will attract you with tons of item you have to harvest and intelligent AI that you cannot predict their behavior. I would recommend this game if your computer spec can reach the point. Playing with friends is main event for this game but it is also possible to hunt alone.
1;This game is the best Monster Hunter I've played. If you are a fan... You should get it. I have had Zero connection issues (preordered) and My friend and I have always been able to get into games together. Ive done all the quest and now I am just grinding for the gear and decorations I want while waiting for new content. Took me about 60 hrs to beat the game game and 100 hours to complete all quest (I ran a bunch of different quests which added to the time but I am not complaining about it).
1;It's a lot of fun I highly recommend it. Be aware that the CPU requirements are fairly intensive I actually purchased it without checking and as a result was unable to play wiothout upgrading my computer. If you've got the PC specs it runs like a dream and looks beautiful. The gameplay get s a bit grindy after a while but hunting everything once is a worthy enough goal to keep you going for a long time.Highly recommend trying co op with a friend.
1;It's one of the few titles that reward player for time contributed. Amazing ecosystem so random interactions between players and mobs and what's the most important lot of fun if you at least a little bit curious. I encurage all gamers to buy it as it's just ripped from salt and negative attitude of players known from other multiplayer games. Amazing graphics leaves you amazed by world panorama scenes. However this all is connected with cost of a good computer. But still worth.
1;"""On the main review page? You see that thing on the left how many reviews does it say I have. Jack squat right? I never review because I never often have something to say of importance. This is the exception.""""PLAY MONSTER HUNTER WORLD! If you are new to the franchise this is where you start. If you are a veteren from older games me this is where our community grows.""""That is all."""
1;Amazing game beautiful graphics and great gameplay. Playing with friends is even better with the Monster Shenanigans. I haven't witnessed many bugs and I would gladly play full price for this game. The Coral area is absolutely beautiful as well. Can't wait for Pickle Joe to deathbeam his way over to the New World.
1;ok so im going to make this quick.... This game is awesome. Ive played MHFU Mhp3rd and MH3U and this is by far my favorite.. Everyone who leaves reviews is just a salty sunflower. There is a reason this is the 4th most played game on steam right now!!! )
1;I played monster hunter since the first monster hunter and this game is so much easier compared to previous gamesAlso there is not many new monster the rest is just converted from the previous gameBut evenso i still like monster hunter can be played on PC and you can create meme character
1;Worth the wait! Not sure why so many people have had issues with the game but I seem to run it fine. Currently running a i5 7600k with a GTX 1060GB. Seems to work fine. Multiplayer is so much fun too!**Update****AS OF 9/11/2018 I have not had ANY connection issues whatsoever****9/19 noticed connection issues when I'm in game and press the windows key or tab out of the game it will occasionally disconnect (so long as I dont tab out often or at all game seems to stay stable.**
1;As of September 20th patch I think this game is finally worth buying at full price. Raw input more consistent FPS (looking at you Teostra) and functional multiplayer has the game working mostly as intended.Original You took 7 months to get this right? Really Capcom? Unless you're a die hard fan of Monster Hunter this isn't worth your money. At least not until they fix the broken multiplayer lack of raw input and otherwise terrible controls. An amazing game with a terrible port as it stands now.
1;Graphic 10/10Gameplay 10/10Multiplayer still sucks keep dc but doesn't really matter just need to wait them to fix itThis game is not for everyone because the grinding and the mechanism makes the game quite hard if you don't know what this game is...But overall it's good and brings back memories...EDIT The connection patched already and it fixed... Great game...
1;Now that the servers are fixed I feel like a real human being again! I'm definitely not just saying this so that Capcom doesn't rip the game from my grimey lil gamer hands! P.S. Where is the aggressive pickle Capcom? I know you have him stored somewhere in the back...
1;MHW is a great game. Yes it has a server problem that is being worked on and it's not as bad as people would have you think you might the boot once ever 5 hours and it's not that big a deal just go to the next one. This is my case with the game some people might have more DCs.
1;I love the game I love the Monster Hunter series but how long does it take to fix your server/connection issues? The First few days I was alright with it but the fact its still happening now is ridiculous. I can't reccomend a product that doesn't work as intended at full price.UPDATEEver since the first patch connection has been much better it's more diffcult to find people to play with but at least it's stable and playble. If you want to play with friends it should work well now.

1;Haven't dc mid fight in some time is been like 2 weeks now. The only time I have is only when I tab out on fallscreen. I recamend borderless window mode and having fun. xDOnly problem I have with the game is that monsters clip in things a lot. But thats not something you don't see in games these days.Performance 8/10Graphics 9/10Sound 7/10Gamplay 9/10Cats 100/10(Was updated on the 18 September 2018)
1;Pros Very good PC port Game is kept fresh with regular updates Issues that were present at release have nearly all been fixed Good controller support Massive amount of content after story is completed Many different types of weapons available so you can find which weapons suits your playstyleSo many more good things about this game i could listCons Besides server issues that were present after release the only con I found is the decoration farming post game very long grind
1;"""Its a great one of a kind """"boss"""" fighting game but is weighed down by being a quite below average port. But seeing as how high quality each of the monsters are and the amount of content present in the game combined with more bosses and gear post launch for free I cant help but reccomend it.However If you're thinking about buying it I highly reccomend using a controller the game and the controlles feels a lot smoother with it."""
1;So this game has been out for a few weeks and I've already logged nearly 100 hours if that doesn't say enough I don't know what will. Gameplay is smooth and QoL improvements over previous series entries are immense. Initially I had connection errors but the recent patch has really helped and I'm sure it'll improve more in the future being their first PC port. A solid first entry in the PC realm for Monster Hunter.
1;This is easily one of my favorite games from this year. If you can look past the network issues every so often its a amazing game. It's finally a monster hunter where it doesn't look like a ps2 game. ScottFalco did a amazing video covering this game and i reccomend you watching it if you're intrested in buying mhw.
1;Never really do reviews but this game is worth putting one out for. The mixed is mostly due to the connection issues on release this is fixed now personally I have had no problems at all since release. So all in all brilliant game good times great with friends and great solo.
1;Game is amazing it's Monster Hunter afterall! Treat yourself you won't get this kind of experience in any other game.Negative reviews are mostly butthurt don't make them change your mind theyre just minor issues that are bound to be fixed soon after release.
1;The best Monster Hunter game of all time. Perfect for beginners in the series. Despite the early network issues they are all fixed by now (at least to me and my friends). Hundreds of hours worth of content. Must buy and extremely cheap on steam (compared to console).
1;Im a regular gamer ... i play alot of moba's final fantasy's etc. this game has alotta mixed reviews and i believe its because gaming these days is expected to be .... easy. This game is NOT easy. This game chalenges you and who ever u play with. it's for lack of a better word challenging and refreshing.I give this game a 5 star rating because its beautiful challenging and if u push through the the uncomfortable beginning game and get used to things one oif the best games ive ever played.
1;this game is definitely one of a kind! if you have played monster hunter series before this one is for me the best. It has some new things that make hunting monster more fun. I am already 50 hours plus into this game yet I'm still enjoying this game wanting some more.
1;As someone who had 400+ hours on PS4 I def reccomend this game.Ppl who are worried about the connection issue there is a temp fix and its steam fault why the dcs happen so ofen not the games fault so no need to blame the game for it and they are working on a fix cuz steam wont fix it.11/10 would sink anouther 400+ hours ezy
1;I am having a great time in MHW it runs better than all of the pc ports ive played so far the connection issues only appear to occur at a random time but it get consistent connect at 1 point. Also i blame valve for disconnections in multiplayer (If MHW is P2P)
1;this port crash after crash after crash on top of all the grind for deco at end game now you also have to deal with loosing your rewards cause the game keeps crashinggggg.they seem to have fixed the crashing problems since SOS are a lot more stables now.
1;11/10Playing on a toaster with 15 25 FPS and enjoying the hell out of it. Never played a Monster Hunter game before but it is everything I hoped for.Fight increasingly stronger and more complex monster until you come across one you can't beat improve your self your gear your prep and try again until you push through or go for easier hunts for a while and then return.
1;First Monster Hunter since the mission on MGS Peace Walker and I love it.Disconnect from the online servers from time to time even if the game say you are online your session is unaccessible and will need you to make a new online session.I would say play with some friends the game is clearly made to play with friends and not strangers.DENUEVO inside this goes to your own moral if you are okay with it or not.
1;The game is a ton of fun but with all the problems it has right now I can't give it a good review.After the newest patch most of the online issues have been fixed there's still some occasional dropped sessions but a lot of games have those.There's still quite a few issues but Capcom has shown that they're going to work on it consider this a neutral review.
1;Review adjusted post fix to online issues.Amazing game. There's not much as entertaining as killing huge monsters with your friends. Combat feels great. If you're playing with m+kb you'll likely have to adjust a few controls but it's decent. Getting trough the story is just a beginning the end game grind is real.
1;I dont think I have words to describe what could be one of the best game I've played in years. This game is top in Singleplayer content replayability and ability to make you lose track of time when playing. Granted the game has several issues such as the famous connectivity problems and other bugs affecting gameplay experience. What I will say is that these problems will most likely be fixed sooner or later and 95% of the game is accessible regardless of them.
1;A very detailed game with beautiful effects I think capcom did a good job on this game sure there are some bugs but not many and capcom addresses any known bugs to the public and notifies when a fix is coming. In my opinion I think they handled this game very well and recommend anyone to give it a try.
1;10 30x better load times than the console versions. Performance is fine as long as you can accept not running on ultra if your rig is older. Don't listen to the negative reveiws the only issues the game has are a few minor bugs and the expected launch server issues.
1;Product received for free. Communication ERORR 83 MW1 !.. if your connection got RTO or become high ping or sometimes you got offline while playing multiplayer but this is at early 1 week after release the game and now i didnt got it again.. Fun game. too much grind hunting and hunting. fun to play with other players or with friends. Epic fight while the monster got duel with the other monster. nice combat and good weapon.i recommend this game.. gg!
1;FIGHT BIG MONSTERS AND WEAR THEIR SKIN LIKE ARMOR TO FIGHT MORE BIG MONSTERS10/10 ING AWESOMEEdit #2Capcom sort of got their together and actually made it possible to play with friends so it's back to being reccomended for me.Game is fantastic best monster hunter to date.
1;Played straight 9 hours from lauch (19 00 PM) to 4 AM. I will skip work tomorrow.Worth it.Edit currently the game have a very important connection issues. This make multiplayer unplayable most of the time (I now go 95% of the time solo). Since this really impact the game experience at the moment you should not buy this and suffer.2nd edit after the patch the multiplayer work really well. I have played about 10 20 quests with no disconnect problem so far.
1;I would say so far this game is worth buying especially when you have friends to play with it makes the game more enjoyable. It only has some minor connection issues and sometimes resolution issues (changing from windows to full screen). But if you are buying it be prepared for tons of challenges )
1;My only complaint is not being able to join a friend's private session from in game. You have to go back to the main menu to join and its really annoying.Other than that the game is absolutely gorgeous and I love it. Just wish they would've brought in some of the dlc for the pc when they finally released it. I'd love to see Gore/Shagaru Magala on here but it probably won't happen.
1;Capcom does not care to solve the problem.Disconnection problems are not resolved.I never end the hunt with my friends.Monster hunter world is a single player game.Status Update My friends stopped playing this game.They were disappointed not to be able to play together.Status Update Connection problems have been resolved to work well.Me and my friends have fun together again.Thanks capcom
1;Good job running well with my old x58 machine w/ 1070ti all time smooth and no glitch or freeze situation while ply in high setting 1080p.The graphic really amazing! Seem connection issue fixed and tested for a few match no more DC!!!Well done Capcom and Steam make this game shine again
1;I haven't played any other monster hunter games before but I'm having a ton of fun here. However it's true that the online multiplayer has a lot of problems with frequent disconnects or failure to join sessions. If that's a sticking point for you consider holding off on your purchase until (hopefully) Capcom fixes the servers.
1;60 FPS at 4K 7700k and 1080ti. Game runs like butter. Turn of Volumetric Lighting to git rid of the ugly haze. Update your graphics drivers for the best performance.Some suggested remaps Sprint/Sheath &gt QBlock &gt ShiftAim &gt Right ClickLip syncing looks like it was done twoard the Japanese language but it's not really a big deal. Mouse acceleration seemed bad in the title screen but after adjusting settings the game runs fine.
1;This game is fun despite the menus being a little unintuitive at first. Connection issues seem to have been resolved. Joining random games is fine...the only time I ever have problems now is when trying to join a friend's online session directly. The easiest workaround for this seems to be connecting directly via SessionID rather than trying to Join Friends Session.
1;This is one of the best game released for pc all year. The devs took their time in making the port and it runs great on my 4 year old laptop. I would highly recommend it to anyone who can buy it. Its story is weak but the gameplay is stronger then ever in this addition to the monster hunter games. This is by far the best monster hunter to date.
1;I'm MHW fan. i been wait since PSP.This game is definitely a very good game. i'm still bough it if it a offline game.But when u said it can play online and turn out can't. that's bad.i invite many of my freind to play. now i feel bad. ( now they fix it. it's alot better.
1;Absolute blast with friends and strangers alike. There were a few connectivity issues at first but Capcom worked dilligently to correct them. Easy for newcomers to pick up but still has plenty of meat for older fans of the series. Give me a moment while I sharpen my bagpipes.
1;I love the game. It's fun when it works. A lot of people are apparently having issues with framerates and crashes. I am one of those people. Settings all put as low as they get still get BAD FPS drops due to CPU (i7 6700) being obliterated. Then the game crashes randomly but I haven't been able to figure out what causes it. Overall I'd say it's worth and I'm gonna keep playing it because it's a lot of fun. Be wary if you think FPS drops and crashes will make your AAA experience unenjoyable.
1;Now that the latest patch mostly reduces the number of disconnects that me and my friends got I definitely recommend this game for the gameplay experience that it offers.Also dear Capcom please bring the DLC monsters and events to the PC version ASAP.
1;The game itself is amazing.Gameplay is smooth monsters are challenging enough and the graphics are great.It's a surprisingly good port with no frame drops and well transfered controls from controller to keyboard+mouse (it does support controllers too).The only problem right now is problematic servers but they appear to be less problematic every day since release.All in all amazing game.
1;Post a new Quest to hunt Anjanath Find Anjanath. You can use Flare now.Me Well time to use flare so my friend can help me to kill Anja Server Not on my watch ! *Disconnect now you will continue to play offline mode can't use flare*But seriously I hope they will fix this frequent disconnect as soon as possible.
1;Fun and addictive game. Well worth its money. People nagging and moaning about fov and mouse input is a good sign that the game itself is excellent. It looks good plays good and most importantly feels good. I really started to enjoy it after i plugged in my trusty 360 controller. Only flaw in my opinion is the slightly awkward multiplayer regarding story missions but its not that big of a deal people make it be. 9/10
1;Let me put it to you this way you're missing out on something great if you haven't played Monster Hunter with your friends. Monster Hunter World is a great game. I've been playing monster hunter since 2009. I've put thousands of hours into the games in the past. So far this monster hunter is an upgrade from the past titles. Tip ReShade. Download it install it. Makes all games look better.
1;mostly enjoyable but needs some optimization connetion stability and quality of life fixed. hope it gets better over time.highly recommended if you like bossfights a lot. just don't expect the combat to be arcade y(like witcher 3). it takes some getting used to.
1;Easy enough said I love this game BUT there is the one issue i have and I am pretty sure i speak for everyone playing this is that we all wish the internet connectivity was fixed. If this issue is resolved this would be my game of the year hands down but because of this online issue I have to knock the score down until they fix it so I give it like a 6.5/10 if fixed then it easily be a 9/10. PLZ whoever is responsible for this fix do it soon its killing off your community.
1;Having tons of fun with this game it's combat is fantastic and extremely statisfying. The only negative I have for this game is that the multiplayer is a hazzle. When you and your friends hunt a monster for the first time you have to go watch a cutscene with the monster alone before you can join eachother.
1;I think you guys should fix the controller problem.Everytime I play MHW I have to restart the game for few times to activate my Xbox console.Plus I do hope u guys can fix the connecttion problem in multiplayer.Keep disconnect even I change my setting in firewall I comfirm that my Internet connection have no problem.Lastly I really hope u guys can fix those issues that I mentioned earlier.Thx.
1;No performance issues on my side but i came across some network issues. Also it seems like the voicechat is broken.Taking that aside the game is great loving the track mechanich (not so much the glowy footprints) and the monster fights in the connected map and the little quality of life improvements.
1;It's really fun and pretty much the game I've wanted to play since January of this year BUT it isn't without issues like mouse acceleration being annoying motion blur and MP being very unstable at the moment.Other than that though the game plays well runs fine for me and looks pretty so no complains here on my end.
1;A game that has consistently been well worth my money but with a few annoying quirks and issues. I don't know if I can recommend this game if you're looking to play through the story in co op only but if you're looking to delve into the meat of the game (the endgame grind) with friends you should be good to go. If this is your kind of game the amount of value and content it delivers is insane easily over 100 hours
1;It's great. The best Monster Hunter game ever made is now on PC. Yeah it requires a recent CPU from the last 2 years and make sure your graphics card drivers are updated but it really is an amazing game. Played for 12 hours straight on release day don't ask me how it's just that good
1;A few fps drop in first area and area 14 on first map (I assume it's heavier on those specific part).Other than that the game run smoothly on my pc (Win10 1060 6GB 6700K 16GB RAM).Satisfying kill for the big monsters Edit 2 Multiplayer seems to be fixed with recent patch.
1;This game is godly in its gameplay. However people who have low end computers (such as myself) really suffer with the frames at 30fps on 720p. Besides that theres also the problem of connections being lost at a certain time of day where the servers have gone to Wouldn't recommend this game right now while theres still those game breaking issues but if things get under control this can easily be GOTY worthy.
1;Monster Hunter finally gets its debut on PC and is simply delightful. Originally released on the PS4 the port functions entirely as expected. This review is 3 days after release and sometimes there are issues with staying connected to the online services but there was the exact same issues on the PS4 launch that was resolved early with a patch.Now if you'll excuse me I have monsters to hunt and new gear to craft.
1;My experience with this AGAIN! is that its beautiful amazing and so nostalgic! I really wish they had the OG theme song I would def recommend this to anyone new to the series. Hands down an easy game to come into. Its not like it use top be I can assure you that! G rank I hope it comes out soon! or another version with G rank monsters!
1;This port definitely has lots of problems that need to be ironed out including frequent connection issues.That said as someone who has not played a monster hunter game before I find the core gameplay very fun even solo and thoroughly enjoy the variety of weapons in particular. Still worth it even in spite of the problems in my opinion.Besides if Nier Automata can get a pass for it's port this game should too.
1;a great game to play but sadly the multiplayer problem that is making the player frustrated. As MH is a fun game to play with friend together. hope capcom or valce can solve the server disconnection issue soon and will not recommend until the new patching is done for the multiplayer problem.new patching is done to solve the DC issue.
1;The game content immersiveness is awesome. BUY NOW!!I have an i7 4790k overclocked to 4.8ghz and GTX 1080 with 16GB RAM and am only getting around 60 80 FPS on 2560x1440 with the Highest settings and Volume Rendering Quality turned off.My partner has an i5 6500 (stock) AMD R9 390 8GB RAM and getting around 50 60FPS on 1080p High settings with Volume Rendering Quality.
1;at the end of the day it's monster hunter. if you're a vet you should have a good time. I haven't had many connection issues and i'm enjoying the loot grind. running it at 4k 45 60 ish fps looks great and i don't mind the frame drops all that much but hey that's just me. if you have a 3ds or a switch buy those monster hunter games they're better in my book but if your looking for a monster hunter game on pc that isn't in nintendo speak this is a good pick.
1;This is the first Monster Hunter I have actually played past five minutes. As soon as I heard Monster Hunter was being released on PC it immediately drew my attention. I can honestly say that it is such a rewarding and action packed game. The combat is beautiful the creatures are challenging and the world is so vibrant. You can tell a lot of time effort and love went into the creation of this game. Wholeheartedly recommend. Will continue to support the brand for years to come.
1;OLD It's just frustrating playing something you love that won t work when it's at it's best... UPDATE Even tho the patch was small I've had very few DC's in quite a few hunts. Still having some errors with creating rooms but so far so good. Lets just say that when the connection is good enough to start running into trolls we on the right path.
1;Honestly this game is great. Really really great but pls Cupcom fix your godforsaken servers. If I see another (insert yours favourite numbers) MW1 I'm gonna tear my eyes out.And I hate that on steam there is no option to give something else than positive or negative review. Because seriously Because of server issues I'd love to give this game pretty fair 50%. But I cant and this suck.
1;In my previous review I gave this game a thumb down because I can't play co op with my friends after got so many network error. With this new patch I rarely got network error again when playing co op. I hope the developer continue to improve this game. Thank you for listening to MWH PC players CAPCOM!
1;pros u get to make a cute cat and then as u progress u get better armor for ur cat and even get to face ancient creatures known as elder kittenscons the game sometimes disconnects from ur team when ur playing with other cats (rarely happens to me average 1 in 10 occurences)very well recommended
1;Always been a fan of Monster Hunter games but stopped playing when it got ported to Nintendo now that its back to PC i had lots of fun playing/grinding through the game. Only problem that i encountered was the servers constantly getting me disconnected but still kudos to the devs hoping for more updates/events soon
1;Amazing game been a fan of the series since childhood when Tri came out on Wii and me and my brother rushed to the next town over to buy it on release day after watching the advert for it every time it was on TV for months. None of that was important aside from perhaps highlighting a bias anyway I'd say World is just a beautiful game and a great addiction to the franchise.
1;Multiplayer errors are rare now and no crashes or any save file corruptions in my part. Game is enjoyable but I know someone whose save file got corrupted after a power outage. Give the game some time it will sort out most issues. Great experience with the game so far. MHW is a 9/10 for me.
1;"""Game is taxing and you need a """"powerful"""" pc to play at 60 fps and even then you might experience fps drops when attacking monsters or when big effects happen but that's kinda to be expected.But that's a small inconveniance compared to the fun and thrill of this game.11/10 Palicos"""
1;To briefly summarize what people were saying on the discussion page yesterday NO PRELOAD! DENUVO! MOUSE ACCELERATION!!! SCREW THIS GAME IT'S GONNA GET REVIEW BOMBED!!!11!!!!1111!!!1111!!In other words this is the best PC game since The Witcher 3 and Dark Souls 3 and has surpassed both in terms of launch sales and number of concurrent players at launch.
1;So many diconnects from multiplayer it really takes the fun out of it. Bought this game to play multiplayer and it just keeps disconnecting. And it's definitely not my internet. I've played heaps of multiplayer online games with no issues and you get so many disconnects on a daily basis on MHW. Considering how much this game costs you would expect simple things like this to work.edit Now that they've fixed multiplayer the game is so much more enjoyable!
1;I love this game. It is as fun as I hoped it would be and feels the best of any Monster Hunter game i've played. If you are a newbie or a seasoned veteran this is a fun experience that you should try. Whats even better is you don't have to buy an entirely new console to play it.
1;Love the game played solo through PS4 version then got the PC version to enjoy the game with friends.There's still a few issues (FPS particle lag textures) but overall the game's enjoyable.*Updated to positive as connection issues are now mainly fixed.
1;Game is by far one of the best ive played have a 1050ti i5 3450 (bottlenecked gpu) play the game at max settings 40fps easily could get better but completed the game anyways had a wonderful time playing get a controller controls on kb and m are wonky this game is an absolute blast and i reccomend it to everyone if you like third person combat and killing massive monsters
1;Edit 08.09.2018 After they fixed the Servers finally I was testing it to make sure. But now I can give this game a thumbs up.Old I would really like to recommend this game but I can't right now due to the issues with the servers mostly kno*Error continuing in offline mode*Oh sorry where was I? Anyway like i said curren*Error continuing in offline mode*Sigh by now you should underrstand what I me*Error continuing in offline mode*Apart from that when they work it's fun.
1;This game is great. To fix the problem finding an online session via matchmaker don't use it. Search for an online session and pick one that has lots of people. Not sure how it works with inviting friends because I haven't been able to test it. Hopefully this helps.
1;Dear Sir or Madam I've been avoiding this on PS4 in favor of buying it for PeeCee Mustard Raisins.I like monster map make weapon catDislike ouch owieee ooftoo short didn't read sometimes it can be frustrating and it doesn't forgive mistakes but the camera works much better than in the handhelds and everything is prettier more immersive and dynamic. sent from my iPhone
1;If you were a fan of this series get it. Monster Hunter World saw drastic changes comparing to it's predecessors. It's almost like a complete new game even for experienced Hunter like myself.Somewhat bad porting. FPS drop with low settings buggy login status keep notifying Steam friend list about you started the game.
1;"""Extremely fun solo or with friends. Although others mention having extreme technical issues I have epxerienced absolutely none aside from 3 disconnects in my (currently) 51 hours of playtime nowhere near the """"constant"""" disconnects others mention. Highly reccomended."""
1;Personally I very much like the game I've been playing it sense it came out on Xbox. Despite the now and then internet connection disconnecting the game is still as great as it always has been. People can say they don't like it because of the current problems they are having with it but my mind will not be change. It's a great game
1;It's been many years of playing this series on handhelds and then consoles always dreaming for a PC version. Now that it's here I can finally play it the way I prefer. Compared with the XBox version performance is superb extremely quick loading times (on SSD) and easily runs on max settings (i7 6950X GTX 1080). My single negative for now is the lack of ultrawide resolution but due to the large number of complaints I am confident that a fix will come soon.
1;Really hoping they fix the multiplayer problems soon as randomly disconnecting in the middle of a fight with a full squad kinda sucks. At the very least they addressed there is an issue but we're just going to have to wait and see what they do from there. Great single player experience thoughEDIT Server issues seem to be gone
1;The first entry to Monster Hunter on the PC has been exactly the experience I've been craving!As of a few days out from launch there are some server issues if you are looking for a co op experience but the single player stands up as an excellent game on its own.
1;10/10 would buy againif you've never played a monster hunter game and want to start this takes all the previous games of 14 years and goes plus ultra! The best version of the series.only issue currently at launch is connection but its got a constant 10k players plus just on steeam not including the players on ps4 or xbox so theres just not enough servers it will fix it self with time or better servers.Stay safe hunters! and slay on!
1;Game rocks. The battles are a lot of fun and progressively get harder as you move along in the story and eventually the high rank. Beautiful scenery lots of interesting game mechanics and plenty to craft and do. It has a few flaws (connectivity is a problem) but overall it's just an awesome experience.
1;This is the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. The gameplay is great and playing with friends is really fun. The network connection errors suck but I believe those are getting fixed and it's still playable.Edit 8/26/18 They released a patch that seems to have fixed most of the connection issues. Still not 100% perfect but significantly better.
1;"""The game was definitely a terrible port when it was first released hence its low rating. However the developers have provided numerous fixes and updates and """"most"""" of the issues are resolved. One of the things I really enjoy is the updated mouse control. You can actually play this with a keyboard and mouse now without feeling nauseous every 5 minutes. Would definitely recommend this game seeing how the developers are working hard to fix bugs and the future addition of a lot more content."""
1;+Super fun with or without friends+Getting materials for weapons/armor doesn't feel grindy +14 different weapons classes and many different trees/elements for each weapon (I have about 120+ hours on hammer and still not bored of it)+Repeating same monster hunts are still fun and challenging 40 50 average frames for a high end rig (i7 8700k and gtx 1070x2 sli)(1440p/2k resolution ultra)(Extremely unoptimized for 6 8 months porting this game) No SLI support Disconnection issues when alt+tabbing
1;Product received for free. Easy to pick up but very hard to put down. It isn't perfect though World has its own set of annoying things to deal with such as how often monsters transfer areas resulting in longer clear times not being able to see people in sessions outside of the hub and the PC performance optimization. Still I'd be looking forward to what CAPCOM brings to the table in the following months especially the console anniversary.
1;this game is really perfect it will keep u busy with bosses that u notice ur fighting mosnters about hours but people said matchmaking sucks and their right actually its really hard to find someone to join or be joined in ur quest and if they do they dc usually and soloing monsters have no joy at all cause its a coop game other than that its really good game i think they will fix many things in future
1;This is the first time i write a review about a game in steam usually i hate grindy game because it's tedious not fun.this game is grindy as !! but i tell you this is fun as hell. Because it's not just you leveling up your character it's about you leveling up your skill as a player.Grindy yet RewardingChallenging yet OverwhelmingA truly master piece from the far east10/10
1;So I have had zero issues with connectivity or stuttering or crashing. I played this on PS4 also it's crisper cleaner and alltogether a more pleasant experience. I run it 1080p with 55 60fps constant (with a full party smacking a monster) with a GTX 1070 all settings on max except volume rendering which is off as it makes the game look washe dout anyway. I use both MK and Controller depending on the weapon im using. Such a dream to aim a bowgun with the mouse after YEARS of DS aiming.
1;Im a Bard when im bored im a dwarven lancer. Im pretty addicted to this game. Its not for everyone but if you like hunting monsters with a sometimes clanky combat and friends then get this game. It can be a wee bit grindy so keep that in mind. But its a lot of fun with friends beware the Black Diablos though. Hate that thing.
1;This is the first Monster Hunter I have been able to play and fully experience. Excellent game! Would recommend to friends. Very fun solo and in groups. Several different armor and weapon types to experiment and build on. I will buy more Monster Hunter games in the future.
1;Have been having a lot of fun with this game so far the monster designs are interesting and varied the gameplay has depth and is very fun. I personally have not been having the performance problems others have had so nothing to complain about there overall a good dame and a decent port in my experience.
1;i5 8400 GTX 1080 with updated driver 16GB ram zero issues thus far. I turned off volumentric rendering to get colour back into the game and v sync off. Other than that no settings changed. No crashes a few disconnects here and there but nothing substantial and no problems with mouse input.Very happy!
1;Finally my favorite franchise is on PC for the west! The game is a blast to play and I can't wait to get home to play after work.This is all I wanted from a Monster Hunter game since starting on PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom 2. The game has some issues at the moment and while I hope it gets sorted I'm having a lot of fun!I recommend this game to anyone who likes challenge tight combat loot and co op with your friends.
1;Pros Great combat.Great inmersion.Fighting monsters is incredible fun.Awesome graphics.Cons Some issues with multiplayer connection.Story is kind of meh.Extra info You will need to learn how to use your weapon items environment and monster weakness properly. It is a hard game to master but totally worth it.
1;I've played all since MH3. It's fun fluid and it's more actual monster hunting than menus this time around. I can't even go play MHGU now thanks to this. 90% of connection problems have been fixed so far Capcom SEEMS okay with visual mods but it's still kinda up in the air? There's not a lot of weapon model variety and of course the monster pool isn't as big but that's to be expected with an upscale of a series that's used to being on a 240p device.
1;Very fun and accessible for a newcomer to the series (like myself). Capcom seems very responsive to issues with constant updates in their update branch to fix issues. The connection issues continue to improve with each update (haven't had any since the first round).Performs well with few frame drops and those only occurring during heavy fights.
1;Fantastic game completely let down by multiplayer connectivity issues. If you want to play online with friends it is completely unreliable. The game is advertised as online/multiplayer/co op but has severe connectivity issues. On that basis alone I can't recommend it.This will change if the issues are resolved.Edit Multiplayer has been largely fixed. Can now recommend.
1;People are blowing connectivity issues out of proportion. The game launched with server issues which are essentially resolved now. I play for hours every day with my friends and the only time I get disconnected is when I'm AFK for inactivity.The game runs great looks great and is a ton of fun a great first experience in the Monster Hunter franchise for PC players.
1;This game is amazing. It has tons of amazing features and there is at least 100s of hours of gameplay. All the people complaining about server errors it is week one so let them fix it before you start crying unplayable. I have had zero problems playing this game and have already put 50 hours in. Don't listen to all the downers. They are already working on the servers and it isn't as impossible as people make it out.
1;Basically what I've been waiting for in a Monster Hunter game. It fixes all the technical issues I had with the mobile games to this point and having it available for PC is pretty dang awesome. It has it's issues but it's the most fun that I have had all year.Note I don't generally play online to this point I have played 100% solo.
1;This game is great. Don't get swept up in the negative reviews the game is better than they give it credit. Whatever issues the game currently has will likely be fixed as Capcom is noticing and responding to the complaints. I've been having a great time as is. A few disconnect errors here and there but it hasn't even been a week. Give it some time I'm sure we'll see some good patches. Recommended.
1;It's almost everything I've wanted in a Monster Hunter game. They also trimmed down or simplified a lot of the more grindy aspects making for a more fluid game. All the customization is still there just easier to work with an understand. However the biggest thing is the food graphics are amazing. Always makes me hungry.
1;Online connection has been fixed for the most part however alt tabbing can cause you to disconnect. SOS flares are a bit wonky since they only show a few missions where you can join other people even though there are over 200k people online. Overall it has omproved and I expect the other issues to be fixed soon
1;Ok so i got this game because it looked really cool and neat the only things i dont like 1)Connection issues to the multiplayer servers however that can be fixed so it is a solo only thing for now.2) i dont care for the targeting style it is either it jumps from target to target in the area hold down a button or dont use it. other than that i think it would be a solid game to play and i will enjoy it till the issues are fix
1;I have been lucky enough to not run into any issues with this game and so far it's been a blast. Although I haven't been able to play online for there is an issue being resolved on capcom's end. I turned off volume rendering and sit at 60 fps 90% of the time. Everything else is high/max. Running on a gtx 1080 i7 7700k.Basically the game does has technical issues (that I haven't ran into personally) and the game is fun.
1;Playable enough for a diehard monster hunter fan on an amd hd6850 and fx6130 (lowest settings usually 20 30fps).Main issues are disconnecting issues and crashing for some people.But its ing monster hunter so im obligated to drop at least 300 hours in it if not 600+ regardless of the tech issues. The game itself is great and very fun both solo and with friends. No regrets dropping $60 on it even if its barely playable on my rig.Bring back Lagiacrus damn it.
1;This game is great for single player.But for those who seek co op sessions with their friends like me I won't recommend this game until they fix Multiplayer.Edit They already fixed Communication Errors. Not totally fixed but at least it happens less frequent than before. Just to be clear I bought it for its multiplayer feature. That's why I gave it a Negative Feedback.
1;Game is absolutely amazing. Not my favorite in the series but pretty close. Friendly to beginners. My fps does seem to drop when weapons with special effects are used particularly with thunder ammo for some reason but it is manageable. An interesting roster of monsters combined with 14 different weapons each with their own unique play style gives this game tons of content. Highly recommend 9/10
1;Just like the PlayStation version this game quickly took over all my time. It has some server problems but the PlayStation version had the same issues. Taking out Squads and making everything run through steam made it even more complicated to join your friends sessions. I hope they patch squads back in at some point. I love this game and I know I'll end up with 300+ hours on it just as I did with the PlayStation version.
1;Did you ever have the sudden urge to smack prehistoric creatures in the head with oversized weapons made from the carcasses of their brethren? Well look no further.One of the best if not the best iteration of the series. Many great reworks quality of life changes and new additions. Online mode has still a few problems but nothing to keep you from playing.
1;In the past I've played MH in fact I played MH Tri and I became adicted to it if Capcom knows something is how to make fun grinds. MHW is so far a great experience except for 1 thing... connectivity issues Either some people can join the session while others are unable too or you lose connection to your team members in the worst time possible leaving you to fight 1v1 a darn Diablos. Capcom please fix this and your game would be the GoY hands down no questions!
1;Running smooth so far on Ryzen 1600x with RX570x. Multi player have some problems but I moslty hunt alone on lower rank and early high rank means more zeny. This is an easy game compared to MH4U moslty because the tedius stuff were removed but Monster hunting difficulty is moslty the same and balanced.
1;Great game. And absolutely no issues whatsoever except for some quality of life stuff which I would like to see in a PC game. Nothing that can't be added through future patches. The game is perfectly playable. Played online with a friend for 5 hours without any issues. I really don't get all those spoiled brats whining about the small stuff. Don't get intimidated by it unless of course you're one of them as well.
1;"""TLDR Pros It is exactly what you want when you think of a 2018 Monster Hunter game on pcCons regularly disconnects for no obvious reason controls with mouse and keyboard are clunky at times feels like they only spend about 3 days working on porting it to pc instead of over half a yearStill 8/10 would play for 500hrs because its MH but really disappoints in the """"well polished port"""" deparment"""
1;It is just sooo goooodddd!!! I've been waiting for proper Monster Hunter game for PC even had to use emulators before but now the hunt is on!I play mostly solo and there are no issues. Currently there are some major issues with multiplayer connection.
1;It's a good port of an instant classic High runs smooth on my GTX 1060 and low 720p runs smooth on a friend's GTX 950m (below minimum recommended). All menus seem to work fine with a mouse although it is clear that the game was designed with a gamepad in mind which I think is fine as everything works fine.
1;wish it came out for steam in june or may id already have a few hundred hours maybe a thousand or two. Ive seen disconnection problems out the wazzu but my net is bad anyway so i was planning on solo play for most of it until i went back to college. Yeah the disconnects are annoying but on my end they seem to be mostly due to my bad net and not servers. My friends with pretty good net never have a problem.
1;Haven't been this hooked to a game since i played Warframe back in 2014. It is grindy but the game makes the grind fun. Currently there are server issues thatvare being resolved as of now. Like many this is my first monster hunter experience and i highly recomend others joining in.
1;While the optimization of the game can certainly be improved i have found it to be quite a good port. Let hope Capcom fixes the server issues and it would be golden. As for the campaign being solo as everyone seems to think. The one thing you can do is simply have all you friends start the quests and watch the cutscenes. You can the return to town and post the quest now everyone can join. (Or us and SOS for random people to show up).
1;"""Hit It Until It Dies World is a great game.Some things have been streamlined from past entries but that's ok most of the things that people will say have been """"casualized"""" are just quality of life improvements. (Go play your looking game 5 year old XX Ultimate on the switch dudes)All weapons are viable for the first time in the freaking series all the armors are cool.The DLC can't come soon enough."""
1;I've played MH since Tri and the Wii and World is another great game in the series. A ton of QOL improvements pair well with the hi res graphics and open world. THe game has a slighy smaller roster than I would like but Capcom appears to be supporting the game quiet well based on the PS4 event quests I've heard about. Online play issues are a minor inconvinience but the game can be played solo and doing so is the best way to learn new weapons or get better at fighting monsters.
1;This is my first Monster Hunter game and I've been having tons of fun. There's a disturbing lack of MMOs right now and MHW has given me the grind that I've been longing for. I'm about 90 hours in at the point of writing this review. I have enjoyed playing both single and multiplayer. The multiplayer issues unfortunately affect me everyday I have to remake sessions or restart the game to enjoy it with my friends.
1;The game is an absolute blast but waiting until early launch bugs have been worked out to an extent might be called for. It's not enough to ruin my time in the game since most issues are simply intermittent and the game works properly after a bit of waiting but they are clearly very annoying to some players. The only issue I've had that I can't understand is a recent issue that causes my cutscene dialogue to slowly go out of sync to a quite large extent but hopefully that's fixed soon.
1;game is good... i have almost 1000 hours on ps4 and my only issue was with being able to data transfer to pc.. i realized that pc release wont have the updated content that the consoles have gotten over the months so data transfer may be a little tricky.. just wish i could have continued where i stopped on ps4 on pc.. i read that transfer is alllowed with other MH games
1;Negative Reviews Conection Issues (True but Sp doesnt need it)Hard gameNo 32k Resolution with Ultra MEGA Wide Screen (no one need)Bad Mouse and Keyboard port (I cant say this. Played 50h now with m/k and it works fine yeah you have to change a few bindings but tell me a game where all Setings are made for everyone)All in all They have to fix conections and its a perfect game 10/10
1;I fell in love with the Monster Hunter series with MH Generations on the Nintendo 3DS. I waited patiently to be able to play on PC with my friends and I wasn't disappointed.The game is fantastic. Hunting monsters is just plain FUN. Yes there are some bugs and server instability issues around the launch but that doesn't make the game bad. Look past the people who are so quick to just rate this as a bad game because they had minor issues on day 1.
1;Requires you to tweak the settings for keyboard/mouse default settings suck.. google some guides for this and this game is great.. has connection issues with steam which thay are working on.. these 2 factos are the main reason for the negative reviews. start with increase mouse turn speed in camera settings to 58 62.. otherwise this game will feel broken its on 50 by default.. AWEFULL default setting that is breaking this game's reviews
1;I'm really worried that capcom'll never put another monster hunter game on PC with this reception. Deserved maybe for the broken online. However I can say that my old junky PC is about five years old and has no trouble powering through this game. The game itself is a blast with buttery smooth controls and fluid combat but uh that's what you get when you play Monster Hunter.
1;"""First of all I bought this game for ps4 and pc. So I have put quite some effort in playing this game. It's a really good game as long as you play it with a controller. The only issue with the pc version is that there are """"some"""" connection issues when playing online."""
1;Look the servers are generally ok there are issues from time to time yes but nothing that hasn't stopped me from playing with friends for excessively.Long and short server issues exist but they are going to get fixed eventually the base game is a strong Monster Hunter game and is fun throughout.
1;I've played a lot of hours of this on PS4 and was happy to see that the experience was just as good on PC. I haven't had any trouble with network issues and I'm getting a good framerate even at max graphical settings. I absolutely recommend this game!
1;I'm a long time vet of the series and have enjoyed every moment of it. If you were afraid of getting into the series after rumors of the diffculty of the game know this While it is challenging the game teaches you. You will learn to study your target and remember the moves. After that you will excel. This is one of the most newcomer friendly entries to the series on top of being one of the most beautiful games out there.
1;I love Monster Hunter and World is definitely one of my favorites in the series. Capcom needs to fix the issues with multiplayer and improve the UI for joining games with friends. Great graphics &amp sound design. The game environments are quite beautiful. If you're scared of the negative reviews wait until Capcom releases the first couple patches. We need to show some PC love we're lucky to be given a shot
1;I love the gameplay and atmoshphere only downside is server issues at launch. feels stupid having to spend 5 minutes to get a nicely populated lobby.This game has so much replay value every weapon feels and acts so differently. it truly takes alot of time to master this game.
1;42 hours. Playing solo has no problems so far. Haven't tried multiplayer (except LAN). Trying it with my brother in the next room did not disconnect us or had any errors at all while connected. In short if you're a solo player it's great. If you're looking for coop and your buddies live faraway you might as well stick with consoles.
1;Okay so this port is getting a lot of flack right now. I just wanna say the mouse and keyboard controls feel fine after just an hour playing with them there's even an option to change the analogue item wheel to hotkeys. The multiplayer is complicated overly complicated to get right but once you learn it you've learnt it so you know chill.It's a fun fun funfunfun game and if you can only get it on pc get it. But maybe check if your graphics card has any problems with running it. B) Xx
1;A lot of people are upset about the network issues and yes its very annoying but this is the first monster hunter title ive ever played and I have to say as far as the game itself goes it is amazing. It is a breath of fresh air for the current gaming scene. If you can get past the network drops which is frequent. You will have an amazing time with this game.
1;"""Very fun. If you liked previous Monster Hunter games you'll enjoy this. Lots of qaultiy of life changes from past games. Also I got used to the """"janky"""" mouse controls in literally one match so it's not as big of a deal as some people have made it out to be."""
1;Definitly the superior version compared to PS or XBox. Loading times are a blessing and a constants framerate makes it all the more enjoyable.To improve FPS set shadows and Volume Rendering to low the difference in visuals is neglectable but the additional frames really help out to stabilize the framerate and keeping the game easy on your rig.
1;Got hooked on the game and got 30 h in 2 3 days. I recommend getting this game if you want some good Sologame because the multiplayer is bugged since a few months even on PS and Xbox. Kicks you out of online sessions with friends and puts you in offline mode /
1;I bought this game when it first came out for console. I do not regret buying the it again The game is fun game to get into but not for everyone. Unfortunately there are problems with connection issues and the Denuvo DRM situation. Hopefully these problems will be fixed becuase there is a big community for this series and many of them would love for Capcom to continue releasing games on PC.
1;The game had its many disconnection issues around the launch release but now it's pretty much perfect. This game can be played alone or with 3 other players. Take on an adventure together or get carried by the one friend who's super overpowered and has already won the game.Tell your friend to be nice and grab some gear at your own level and grab the real experience.After beating the game it felt pretty dead to me. Bam. But there will be more monsters and challenges later xd
1;Not a bad port but there are still a few bugs that should be addressed especially for a premium game. Communication errors are very hit and miss one minute you're with a full party hunting diablos the next minute you're solo. On launch theres a resize issue that can sometimes occur. However on the positive side the gameplay and graphics are really well done the lock on target system isn't great but other than that it's super fun.
1;Fantastic game the peformance could be better but with a Ryzen 2700x Gigabyte 1080ti 32 GB DDR4 3000 Mhz and the game installed on an SSD it runs quite well. The game is incredibly fun and well worth trying if you have a computer that can handle it. Hopefully they improve the performance in the futur
1;Love this game been waiting over 5 years before they even enounced it was coming to PC. My only complaint is the controlls. I also play on a Laptop so I can't use both LMB + RMB would love to see a hot key for both bottons in the combat config. Runs pretty well 98% of the time. I can't wait for this to be recognized as one of the best games on PC. Awesome job Capcom really made me wait for this game a very long time
1;Great game the gameplay takes some time to get used to but once you do it's a blast. The optimization isn't great though probably the only problem with this game it's not as bad as Ubisoft's garbage optimizations but still with the time it took them to port the game to PC I was expecting a bit more.It's a really good game though def worth a buy even when not on sale.
1;I run a 940mx with 2GB Vram on a laptop and this game is able to performance consistently above 30 fps at very low setting.Game still look nice at low setting.Fun with friends.Game is great overall with some annoyances 1. Can't skip cutscenes2. Lip sync is off sometime3. Can't turn off motion blur4. The side character The Handler will annoy you within mintues because she keep repeating the same quote like every 10 secondsDefinitely recommend trying
1;The game is great. It's smooth and the while there are some QoL things to work out such as the connection error messages I can't really complain about much.It's a fun game. The kinks will get worked out and after several hundred hours on MHW for the PS4 I'm glad to be able to play it on PC.
1;Ran into all the bugs Bad TexturesLots of micro stutters and general bad performanceHuge mouse input lagGeneral goofy console interface (radial interface instead of just having a 1 10 hotkey bar)Crash to desktop in middle of hunts losing all progressDenuvo using lots of cpu cyclesConnection errors on hunt completionAnd now 100 hours later they either fixed the bugs or mods are available to fix it for them. Great game!
1;Do you like Dinosaurs? Do you like giant weapons? Do you like deep skill based action combat with 14 drastically different playstyles? Most fun I've had since my winter vacation learning Rocket League. When the multiplayer is more stable this is a serious 9+/10 game.
1;Game is all good but the connection is terrible. Every time I did a mission with my friends the connection lost somehow. I'm 100% sure my network setting is fine because all of my friends have this connection problem as well. Wish this problem will be fixed soon.
1;Awesome game some stuff is not yet working as it should be but these things can get fixed in the near future.Game looks wonderful HD texture for armor and stuff would be awesome and a welcoming sight for the near future.Shame it's getting a mixed review for things that can be fixed C
1;Played Monster hunter ever since the 3GS and have been waiting for it to be on PC. Now that it is finally here it is a great game just like I remembered WHEN IT WORKS.The game is overall really well made and it is enjoyable when the online party doesn t disconnect EVERY GOD DAM TIME. I would recommend this product but wait till they fix the disconnection issues. Because it is really annoying when you are having fun destroying a monster and all sudden hit in the face with a error code.
1;Been playing almost nonstop and love this game so far. 0 issues on pc...runs butter smooth. Mouse and keyboard with a couple of key rebinds work fantastic. Multiplayer seems a bit wonky but works well enough to get by....could be improved though. Overall best game I played in a long while....I cant believe the reviews for it are mixed.
1;I have 60+ hrs on PS4 and the port is great. the only issue i've been running into is disconnected from a session with friends during a quest. The disconnects are not game breaking and given how Capcom handled things on PS4 im sure the connection issues will be fixed in no time. love the game and i highly recommend
1;Man o man! I waited for this game for such a long time and the hype was worth it. I have only done the tutorial in about 5 mins but spent the other 2 hrs and 55 mins tweaking my Steam Controller and also spend a fraction of the time making my character.Apart from the rough start the game is worth every penny! Oh and I will continue to update my review as I play.
1;Love the game. Extremely fun fights and rewarding combat. Very fun to play with friends. There certainly are some issues with graphics settings not working proper fps drops in certain areas connections issues etc. However they don't detract from the game experience enough for me to really complain. Things will be corrected over time and the game will continue to get better.
1;Great game silky smooth gameplay rewarding difficulty curve. Never had many connection issues with my group of friends or responding to SOS but hopefully todays patch fixes that for everyone else.Headed to 100 hrs on HBG and loving mouse and keyboard for it.May switch to controller for melee but time will tell.Long time MH fan looking forward to this game growing every new monster in the stable is a win for me. Just want a Nargacuga/ Tigrex to show up D
1;Its a great game. Yea the servers are but thats on steams end not the game. Wish there was better input for controls but at the same time i shouldnt expect to swing my switch axe and respond as fast as i would with dual blades. Also if theres a wishlist let my friends gift me materials or gear that i need for those items please
1;It was good but still have alot of poblems mostly on connection usually while playing you will get disconnected allmost all of the time and sometimes the steam cloud sync doesn't sync properly and eded up losing your progress for now i would recommend this game if you would bought it to play solo not for multiplayer yet
1;"""you like darksouls series?but easier one?dodge all you like?and you want to kill some badass monsters?go ahead get this things.theres a problem while we playing co'op with my friend """"A Random Disconnect Time"""" wich mean i cant help my noob ehm i mean poor friend who cant even fight pukei pukei alone."""
1;great game but the PC port is unoptimized and the network issues are frustrating to deal with especially when you're gonna play with a friend or while on a quest it just kicks you on online and you can't reconnect but i'll still recommend this just because it's still a great game even with you just solo
1;While not the greatest port it's still better than the console versions. Much faster load times. Higher framerate at higher resolution. Ability to use kb+m if that's your jam. Sure the servers are finicky and the game could be better optimized but that's hardly a reason to not recommend it. It's still a good game.
1;"""Despite all the """"problems"""" this game is hella fun. You get used to how the multiplayer works after a few plays its not the best but its not game breaking. It's been 3 days since release and I'm sitting at 46 hours worth every painful minute of dieing over and over."""
1;"""Review comming soon...It is a great game I enjoy playing it.This is just for those who are unsecure You can't play this on hardware from 4 5years ago. Otherwise with a bit of tweaking and updating your drivers (plz do that first!!) it will run great.Also this game needs time to get used to. You won't get used to it in just 1 2h. But after some 4 5h you will get this great feeling after slaying the monster that had been sabotaging you for """"days""""."""
1;The Monster Hunter World PC version is a good port of the PS4 version. At launch you get higher frame rates higher resolution faster load times and the ability to play online for free. Right now the servers are having some trouble so online play is a bit tough at the moment but there is enough solo content to get through that can take a week. This game will be a grind fest so expect that going in.Controls on the PC are playable I'm used to using the PS4 controller which it can support.
1;No idea what is going on here. I've only had like 3 disconnections so far and I can run the game at 4K 60fps with a few tweaked settings. Servers can be fixed and an HD texture pack would be pretty sweet too. The game itself is amazing. I would consider this one of the best games I have ever played. If you don't want to risk the server problems wait for patch to be safe I guess.
1;If you don't like this game I am so sorry.This is the best game I have played in a long time the polish and the beauty and the world they have created will be eating up all my free time for a good long while.This is not only the best MH game ever made this is easily the best game since Witcher 3. (I'm aware they are very different genres.)
1;"""haven't u noticed that CAPCOM is trying to deliver a message through this game?""""U love this game?then buy a PS4.U think PC sucks?so do we""""its still a good game thoughjust fix the connection problemI wanna play with my fat roommatePS After this I still don't think Tencent is reliable.Fxxk WEGMAE"""
1;30 hours in and the only major problem i clearly see is the stability of the online play (if you want to play in a group). For the rest of the complains i see in the reviews myself I am not bothered by the lack of in depth PC options to enjoy a great game!
1;It's been a few years since I last played a Monster Hunter franchise MH3 on 3DS. I remember enjoying every bit of grinding back then and I'm sure I would love it now as well especially with online sessions. The PC port is also pretty decent albeit needing a beefy PC for it run on its best performance. Luckily my 5 year old PC can still run it in medium settings with 40fps. I guess it's time to upgrade haha.
1;Awesome game. The PC port is decent despite some connectivity issues that every AAA title would have on release. This will be fixed in no time.Don't listen to toxic plebs with shi tty 5 7 y.o. PCs.Freaking gtx950 2gb in pair with decent CPU (Pyzen 5 1600) can handle 60fps on medium settings with high on textures.Buy it and have fun with it.
1;This is an absolutley amazing game. As soon as you turn off volametric fog you can run this game on a potato. Currently there is a multiplayer bug but there are work arounds if you can be bothered to look in guides or on the mh reddit. No crashes and buttery smooth 60fps.
1;One of the most enjoyable games i have ever played.The variety of weapon choices and builds available to you is phenomenal and really gives you alot of things to doThe variety of weapon classes really lets you choose your playstyle and i presonally feel like they really differ from each other in their movesets.Great game at the moment has no real technical issues. also i never played any of the other mh games
1;Edit 18.09.18 Game connects fine without any issue now! There are some minor issues with sounds looping when they should not and let's not talk about drop rates xD but it's a 10/10 GREAT game!As of 20.08.18 game still suffer connection issues it's fun when it works but I would not recommend buying it as it is now.
1;Coming from an MH vet this is a bloody horrible PC port but an amazing game. I avoided playing the console versions so I could wait for this and play it with m+kb... yet I'm forced to play with a dualshock anyways because of the absolutely horrid mouse acceleration and the way the camera functions. Recommending despite all the issues because it is still a good Monhun at its core.
1;This game is great don't listen to the bad reviews. The port is sub par and the game has some connection issues at the moment because of the demand but if you are playing solo or can put up with a few minutes of inconvenience every 30 minutes with multiplayer this is a great game.
1;The game itself is really fun! Once you figure out multiplayer it's pretty stable with the occasional disconnects but I didn't think of it as anything game breaking.If you're comfortable with controller have some friends you want to play with (after you figure out multiplayer) have an okay rig then I would gladly recommend this game.
1;Was pretty sceptical buying this game as I have never played a monster hunter title before but it absolutely amazes me. Unbelievably challenging want to break my computer sometimes but there s something in my head that drives me to keep on poaching monsters for no reason. 10/10 would get sexually assaulted by a fluffy pink T Rex again
1;Great game! If you want some challenge to be a full time hunter or a part time you can do it. A hunt takes 20 minutes and it is really fun. If you want to play online go for it. They fixed the connection errors so everything is good now. The game is really fun and challenging. 100% recommended.
1;I would love to play this game but throughout lags are denying me that. My PC is way better than the recommended performance is. CPU Intel i5 6600K GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GBRAM 8GB DDR4When anyone know's how to fix this problem please add me and write me a DM
1;I have a 5 year old PC with what I'm assuming isnt exactly top of the line hardware. I have 8gbs of RAM. The game plays with most of the settings on high looks beautiful and plays smooth. The load times are vastly improved over PS4. I have no complaints. Top notch port as far as I'm concerned.
1;the game constantly causes steam to disconnect the controls on keyboard and mouse are good in my opinion coming from games like BDO.optimization is good on an I7 6700k 4.2Ghz + Nvidia 980Ti 1.3ghz. the game stays a solid 60 at max everything bar volumetric effects.tho i have noticed that when steam disconnects it coincides with a stutter ingame.overall i would still recommend this game. it is has its flaws in places but none are terrible enough for me not to enjoy it.
1;I enjoy this game a lot. The only thing that is upsetting is that I've been disconnected from the last 5 SOS quests i've joined. Fix the dang network issues. A game breaking issue and a fix hasn't been put in place is past ridcoulus. I would recommend it to others only if they fix the network issues.
1;Love this game. it runs beautifully online connectivity hasn't been a problem for me and mine and it's Monster Hunter. It's a game that rewards replay and retrying as you learn how to best contend with the different monsters constantly throwing new mechanics and challenges at players without being a slog.
1;Game is damn good solo but nearly perfect with friends. Launch day and the night after were a little rough with disconnects but so are 100% of highly anticipated online games. So I can't really fault it for that because it is a standard with which the entire industry complies.If you want a lot of game for your money you can't go wrong with Monster Hunter World. Especially if you can talk a friend or two into taking the plunge with you. You won't be sorry.
1;An amazing console release the biggest in the series history has made its way to PC. The port itself is workable with noticable bugs in resolution connectivity and matchmaking. Hopefully an upcoming patch will sort out those issues but don't let it detour you from the best MH title available in the U.S.
1;It's taken 3 weeks but the problems with disconnections seem to have been resolvedJust remember to restart your Steam client every 24 hours.I don't need to say anything else. This is monster hunter if you're a fan? You've already bought this. If you aren't? There's little I can say to change your mind. If you have no idea why all this anime exists? Go and inject it straight into your veins.
1;I just started playing this game and already I've wasted hours of my time on this game due to the game crashing on me.I would be questing and all of a sudden the game would crash! And i lose all my progress!Although the game is fun they better fix the crashing issue or else I can't even get through like 30 minutes into a quest without it crashing on me.
1;Monster hunter is a game that is as large and capable of devouring the player as the many beasts that inhabit the game. The constant drive to go out and kill and hunt will overcome you if you are not strong enough. You will find yourself elbow deep in your 13th carve of the same monster wondering if this is it but then you find the gem you have been digging for and the game makes sense again. Bretty good/10
1;I do recommend this game. AS IT IS NOW today we finally got a patch fixing the mouse controls together with all the fixes alongside during the last 30 or so days the game is NOW in a state it should have been at the launch... This is a fantastic game you will certainly have ALOT of fun with. I just hope that CAPCOM deliver THESE kind of experiences in the future not the buggy mess of a game it was when we got our hands on it.
1;garbage servers with 5028f mw1 disconnections everytime of the day DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED21/8/2018 EDIT they released a 150mb patch claiming to fix the disconnection errors but still cant find a proper session to join in to overall ruining experience still DO NOT BUY UNTIL FIXED smh cant believe they're ruining a veteran's wet dream over connection issueslate edit they fixed it plz buy the game it's a delight.
1;Every fight is like an MMO raid boss after a fashion. It's clunky or at least difficult for Mouse and Keyboard to start learning controls but once you get into the swing of things you don't really want to get out of them.Definitely recommend playing with others/friends however. It can get stale at some points just listening to the annoying Handler 24/7.
1;Quite a good port but some recommendations Turn off Volume Rendering.Turn off Dynamic Camera.Swap your radial menu to keyboard mode.Tweak the mouse acceleration to your liking.The game itself is very good already put over 500 hours in on the PS4 version.
1;So many people whining about how buggy multiplayer is. Game is absolutely great even though its buggy but those ppl complaining about multiplayer dc's should srsly need to get gud in playing solo. If you're a true monster hunter fan its really not an issue. Weaklings
1;First week its having some issues with connection getting disconnected in multiplayer. that being said I played the entire day today with friends with no issues so its a bit random.Single player there is zero issues what so ever.The game is an easy must buy if you are even considering it just a little you WILL get your moneys worth with this game.its deep super fun. Lots to learn and get better at.Just dive in and don't look back its amazing.
1;It's fun. It's monster hunter on PC which I've been waiting for for years. The PC port pretty bad but is definitely playable with a decent graphics card a controller and if you are playing single player. I'm sure the multiplayer issues will be fixed within a week or two anyways.
1;Made it into 4star and I have to say Im impressed. Will drop a better review later. i7 6th gen16gig ram960mruns at 30fps on med + some settings turned up and some off.Updated moved to a negative review will change once multiplayer is fixed. Really kinda the only point to this game and yall done goofed it up.Updated First real patch and things are actually working now. Review updated to Positive.
1;game is fun especially during multiplayer sessions. unfortunately the multiplayer sometimes doesn't work with random disconnects and such. I find it weird that the server is always down at the same time every single day. it's like capcom is doing a manual reset on their server to clear their cache during busy hourgive it a few weeks till the connection is truly stable if you plan to buy it to play with friendsEDIT connection issue is solved now plus deviljho is out so go nuts
1;Played this game on PS4 loved it now on PC and still love it! Overall haven't had any major issues except for connection issues when questing and frame drops using thunder element weapons. As of this review Capcom are aware of the connection issues and are working with valve to fix it.
1;This game is incredibly good i don't have the problems that some people report besides some crashes after a alt tab.Connectivity is not a problem most of the time after launch it was y but now seems almost 100% of the times working.Overall it's not a bad port but i can see the criticism it's sad that the great game itself is overshadowed by port problems.
1;so far as i have play it has ben an great plesure to play the game runs good the grafix are good lip syinc is an bit bad but its not an english game dub voice acting is good and gameplay is what i payed for but in current state of just released pc its online is barrly functioning to that end il recomend it as an single player but as far as online havent ben able to play with anyone else so its ben an let down in that regard.
1;Performance wise its pretty goodi have an r9 390 8gb I5 4460 15 gb ram overall i can run the game at High with rougly 60 fps due to the high temps my R9 is getting i settled for 1080p Higest Settings on 30 fps and just runs smooth on it at that settings has controller supportbit of advice the game runs like the first time you open so open it up then when at the start screen change your settings then exit out then open it up again that should fix it up
1;Awesome game. I would recommend a controller primarily as it's designed for one and there are some mouse latency issues if you use KBM. There are also some network issues for some players that are being looked into but I haven't encountered any so far and I'm 37 hours in. Highly recommended but you might want to get it for two hours and see if you have problems.
1;Very fun game runs well on my 1060 6gb card with i7 4790k. Have played solo if you're planning on doing a lot of co op maybe wait servers are pretty unstable and have heard a lot of people are having constant disconnects. Feels better on a controller but keyboard mouse is viable. First monster hunter game and I was sucked in all weekend playing it.
1;I've had almost zero problems with multiplayer since launchday dont know what these other players are doing wrongly.Just make friend session and start a quest? Its that simple. If your friends cant see it just make a new session.. takes 1 second anyway.
1;I came back to Monster Hunter series from 10 or so years ago. The game of this version has become more casual and enjoyable for the beginners while there are lots of difficult bosses in the higher stages.I myself am not a good hunter of this game and I quit the series of 10 years ago at the lower stages. But the World is on PC so the graphics are so good and the control ability is much better than PS Portable.
1;I don't know why people are giving a thumbs down it's basically the exact same game as the PS4 version. It is a GREAT game that is very difficult to learn with gorgeous visuals compared to the other Monster Hunter games. Controls will take some time getting used to. When I first started playing I can't even hit stationary targets with the great sword xd but after a while it becomes pretty natural to me
1;Game is great I like it been playing MH games since the first one on ps2 only have missed the Wii ones and I can say this is on the top 3 favorites. Right now the servers are a bit unstable idk if it's on steam or Capcom side but the game is good you'll have lots of fun playing it either solo or multiplayer when it let's you. If you are having frame rate issues check the requirements and check if you have same or better but no one I know so far is having frame rate issues or crashes
1;Best Monster Hunter yet. They clean up a lot of the grind cleaned up a lot of the hit boxes and just improved the general quality of life on the Monster Hunter games in general.Had some issues with connection on day 1 &amp 2 but as of day 3 I haven't had much of any issues.Worth it.
1;MH game on pc.?what more do you want me to say?the game is monster hunter does it look the best? no does it need to? no. does it run perfect? for me it does.is the gameplay fun? yes and there is proof its fun dark souls combat is based on the same principle of dont get hit cause you'll die so dont become greedy and swing your weapon around like a headless chicken cause you gonna die pay attention to your target and run when needed.
1;I had been in love with Monster Hunter since it was on PSP and here is my review on MHW Connection issue (yes alot of people are facing this) Not support 21 9 ratio screen (Pls support this so i can play fullscreen on my 21 9 monitor thanks!!!) Why dont this game have hunter Arts and hunter Styles like they did in MH Genaration?? (Really love this new thing)Other than that the game is amaizing!!
1;According to all known laws of aviation there is no way that a Bazelgeuse should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The Bazelgeuse of course flies anyways. Because Bazelgeuse doesn't care what hunters think is impossible.
1;A vibrant and beautiful game full of humorous interactions with friends and the enviroment combat feels impactful and rewarding yet constantly offers new challenges and adventures to go on fun alone but so much more enjoyable with friends and others I strongly recomend this purchase to anyone who enjoys a game with grindy progression and an ok amount of challenge.
1;ive been waiting for this since they first announced it was coming to pc and i couldn't be happier. This game is AMAZING and i am so happy it works on my laptop. I will be sure to spend hours and hours on this game and i cannot recommend it enough!!!!!
1;So many people are not recommending this game because of the drm. This is a good game but because of the drm the game is keep on crashing for some reason. The game instantly crashes if your CPU doesn't support FMA3 instructions too... WHAT A GREAT PC PORT
1;I'm immediately in love. It's just so good. I'm semi new to the series but I've played a little before but this is a whole new take with brand new mechanics. everything is beautiful and wonderful. EXCEPT!!! The tutorial. Just dredge though it. It sucks it's hand holdy. Then everything past that great. It's a solid port it runs well etc.
1;DOWNVOTE Lack of updates Cosmetic updates onlyThis game is straight up dying. They're lacking good content and have a terrible community. This game is not worth joining into. I quit until they fix their servers and whole game.Update 5/14/18 UPVOTE Servers still crap but developers are at least fixing little by little. Interactive game friendly but can be pretty toxic. 30/70 Friendly/Toxic If you're a fan of doing cool tricks this game surely incorporates all of those.
1;I know that a lot of people are having a lot of issues with network connectivity and bugs. Both game breaking and just irritating. All these are valid and worth your concern. I can say that my personal experience has been nothing but possitive. To be fair I have been playing primarily solo. My system is pretty high end and with that I have seen no frame rate of performance issues at all. Overall it's a suggest from me.
1;Great on pc. Tho lower end rigs will have rough time running game but even maxed out with my rig i get around 50 60 FPS if it drops to 30fps it still looks great to me compared to other games at or near 30fps. I own game on ps4 but no one in the right mind would pay $60 for ps plus then times that by two for two people ($120) nope that s why I bought two pc copies. I think they did a good job on MHW on pc.
1;The Keyboard controlls are suprisingly well thought out.instead of pressing button combinations to go through items like on consoles youz can just scroll your mousewheel or use a hotkey bars. There are a ton of keyboard exclusive options in the controlls menus.Performanc is also good. My processor was middle of the road 8 years ago and it still manages 60 fps.
1;Worth waiting for 9 months.Graphic is smooth details are terrific and they optimized things to be easier for newcomers to the seriesThough I would love if they gonna support 21 9 screen as I just brought Predator X34. Even with black bar on the sides the game still look great.
1;Fantastic game I really enjoy playing it. Managed to make it run decently with my i7 7700k and a GTX770 however I think they should look into the current performance issue to make it an overall better experience for others as there have been a lot of complaints about it.
1;I have bought this game for PS4pro and PC. The PC port is by far so much better than it is on PS4pro. However there are a lot of people complaining that the PC port is not that well done. This is true. There are better PC ports out there and this is not one of them. I will recommend this game though because this version is definitely the superior version out of any of the other versions on the consoles.
1;This game feeds whatever is inside that me that enjoys progression based games. Over 100 hours in so far and not a single crash. I have a strong rig and it runs fantastically. I had some issues staying connected to multiplayer missions early on and it was a bummer but it didn't slow me down any.
1;EDIT After update on 24.8.2018 the connection seems more stable. Still disconnects but acceptable.EDIT cannot complete 1 single online game on 17.8.2018 night. Suspected that server cannot handle happy Friday.This is essentially a good SOLO game. If you are looking for multiplayer hunting it fails. So if you do not care about the Co op/Multiplayer tag of this game it's a recommended.
1;"""Most of the negative reviews are talking about a """"game breaking bug"""" which is entirely because of a need to update a windows codec to view certain videos. I have a total of about 600 hours on ps4 before coming here and assuming they support it the same the game is worth every penny."""
1;The multiplayer is wonky (but i hated its implementation on the consoles too so...) Controls are also wonky but I've adapted (bowgun aiming is V or C... i made it mouse 4 and said whatever lol) Best played with controller probably or you face having to relearn keyboard/mouse because its very atypicalStill a crazy fun game and i have it for ps4 AND pc. love it ( ing hate paying for the priviledge to use my ps4 online so i'd rather have it on pc)
1;Monster Hunter World when it comess to gameplay feels absolutely phenomenal and will not dissapoint in that regard. Connectivity issues do still occur though this can be usually sorted out by reconnecting in the quest menu. Play this game for the gameplay and remember not to tab out at the post final monster cutscene as that does cause issues.Yes/10
1;Beautiful world. Immersive combat system. Epic boss fights its like boss fight every quest you do which makes it even Epic er. Sh*t story line. Cringy acting voice and model animation. The game play is too good for that to matter though.9/10 definitely will buy again.
1;Love this game and being on PC now is perfect for me. My only gripe is they made the camera movements square and not fluid if you move the mouse slowly you can see its based on parallel movements and you cant really make a smooth circle without it feeling like its hitching. alot of people say mouse smoothing and acceleration is on and you cant change it but i just think its the issue that the camera movements are still based on how a controller would function.
1;Great game feels like home in the world of Monster Hunter.Beautiful and engaging just don't expect an RPG since you don't level up and get stats.You kill a monster carve their corpses and use the hide and claws to make better gear.I have an AMD RX480 4GB and an I5 4660 and the game runs without problems 60FPS
1;Guaranteed to make you into a cat lover.All jokes aside I am playing on a mid spec pc and even though I have to adjust my graphics the game still gives you that satisfaction. Sure at first you have to change your keyboard outputs to beat suit your preference and as time goes by you can still do the old combos you would do from previous mh games. I have been playing monster hunter since 2000s from psp to 3ds and this is certainly one of the best monster hunter game yet.
1;This game has vastly improve compared to the buggy initial release.But that does not means it good enough there is a issue with terrible graphics and texture quality while even at the highest graphical settings.Thumps up for the game because it's definitely on the right path.Just focus on the graphics and try to release contents timings to the consoles as close as possible &lt But shouldn't be the main focus untill the core issue of the game is fixed first.
1;Not sure what everyone is complaining about I haven't had any issues.My controller worked on first load with no issues.I can play on highest settings in 4K at 50FPSEverything is working really well I cant complain. This is much more enjoyable to play than the PS4 version which I also have.There was some trouble with getting my friends inside the same session but we figured that out.Ryzen 7 1700x GTX 1080 FE
1;"""TLDR good game got some port kinda issues and capcom underestimated the ammount of attention it would get.Pros its monster hunter good combat good gameplay good for slow burn enjoyment and one off bursts of funCons some graphical setting such as motion blur are unavaible and DRM neither of wich is a major """"dont buy"""" issue imo"""
1;In brief Capcom did for Monster Hunter World what Nintendo did with Breath of the Wild. They took the classic formula and pumped new blood into it which in this case resulted in beautiful graphics awesome new mechanics and a crapload of quality of life changes. My only gripe is the poor optimization but that didn't stop me from having a good time with World overall.
1;Truly a game for marathon enthusiasts at last ported to PC. 9.8/10 IGN and Deviljho of the year. Seriously. Devijho the gretest of pickles has now been added to the PC release which automatically makes this game a sublime experience the very few games could ever possibly achieve.
1;I am loving every aspect of this game from the crafting to the hunt but as a multiplayer focused game there are constant problems with disconnects from lobbies. Should the connections issues get fixed I could recommend this game as of now be ready to be frustrated trying to play with friends or be prepared to do a lot solo.Edit as of 9/10/2018Most connectivity issues have been fixed and playing with friends has not been a problem and I can now recommend this game fully.
1;I'm pretty much a newcomer to Monster Hunter and this game is a lot of fun. I'll be honest it starts off pretty slow for awhile but becomes a lot better once you unlock High Rank and start to learn the systems better and figure out what you need/want to do. I haven't had any connection issues since the patch they released a few weeks ago.
1;First review ever on Steam.I having a blast with the game really fun multiplayer is working for me at least after the last patch and it resolved my fps drops when fighting certain elder dragons which dragged my pc to the floor before.I would recommend 8/10
1;Have played mostly singleplayer and it s been great epic battles with big monsters leading to constant upgrading of gear. Multiplayer has disconnected once for me in quite a few missions together with a friend but I totally understand the frustration of those who have had more problems with this than me.
1;"""Tried on a laptop with a GTX 1070 at 1080p on max and a desktop with a GTX 1080ti at 2K and 4K on max and didn't notice any performance issues. It's a good game and runs/looks better than the PS4 version. Only complaint is the poorly implemented """"wait to watch all cutscenes"""" restriction when trying to play the story co op."""
1;I'll give it a thumbs up when you fix the damn connection issues!!! Trying to play with my husband is a nightmare when he keeps getting disconnected from the session and im left to deal with the now overpowered diablos (with a bow btw) that was meant for multiplayer! Love the game itself though.Update With the patches things have gotten a lot better! No dropping so far and now we can really enjoy hunting together.
1;Apart from the strange buttons used for menus etc. the game is fine. It runs fine on my pc and I didn't have a crash yet. Connection problems were solved once I forwarded the right ports and ran the game in admin mode. steam community only knows black and white these days it seems...
1;It's great to finally get a Monster Hunter game on the PC. Better yet it even has its own modding community. Had a few problems at the start but its already getting better. Certainly excited to see this game continue to grow hopefully to a G Rank version like many other Monster Hunter's before it.
1;Veteran to the series since MH3U. I really enjoy the graphics and the new abilities added to every weapon making them even more unique amongst themselves. I played MHGU when it was released and enjoyed it until I accepted the fact that it just looks like a PS2 game and went back to World. I enjoyed MHW even more after a taste of MHGU and am now in love with the game. Great game to pick up for any newcomers to the series as well. Would recommend!
1;CPU Ryzen 2700xGPU GTX 1070RAM 16GBRESOLUTION 1440pFPS Lock to 60 with volumetric off (helps ALOT for fps)Been playing for a few hours and fps is pretty much staying at 60 with some dips to 57 58 59.The combat is fun the story fine and lots to do on the armour / weapons front. I know some have had issues but it installed and ran fine for me. Although you will need a decent cpu and gpu for anything over 1080p.
1;Don't listen to the people who hate on it this is a great game. the first 5 or so hours are a bit slow but if you get through that this game will open up and become much better. 95% the disconnection issues people have been talking about have been fixed in the past few patches. Overall great game. For new people I reccomend watching a guide on how the weapon you wnat to use works and the basi mechanics of the game.
1;Alright changing review to reflect current state of the game.The game itself was fantastic from day one but it was plagued by horrible connectivity problems for like 3 weeks straight making it unplayable online. Most issues are now gone. And there are still cheaters seen here and there but I haven't had much issue with them.The game can finally be played with friends and have many hundreds of hours left of playability.
1;Decent port miss some options to remove stuff like motion blur and maybe move some elements from the UI.Combat is easier than previous MH and is kees rigid than before only downside is that hitboxes on some monsters are weird.Good game to play with some friends and there is not much competition for this genre of game.
1;This game is great and everything I have been hoping for since I preordered it about a month ago! 10/10 would recommend as a veteran monster hunter player. Hopefully will be more optimized as time goes on but I still would highly recommend this game to anyone who is new or returning to the series!
1;If you thinking no game can stop you from wanking? Try Monster Hunter World. After playing this game i can proudly announce my divorse with my both hands because of Monster Hunter World. Trust me if you are looking for next level or . MHW is the only choice.
1;Great game. New to the franchise but I played this for 250+ hours on PS4 and enjoying starting from scratch on PC. Only complaints are the lack of updates and connectivity fixes present in the console versions not being implemented for PC release and the lack of PS4 controller support (at least for button prompts being in PS4 layout and some of the controls being swapped).
1;I got this game as soon as it launched on steam. It is fun and i enjoy it. However there is one major problem that me and all my friends that play this game encountered. It is server issue. Getting booted from a quest with friend is extremely annoying. I hope there is a future fix.
1;"""Monster Hunter DC""""I don't know who you are but i will find you and i will disconnecting you""""** Finally the newest patch fixed the disconnect problem so from thumbs down into thumbs up now Ty for your hardwork but still alot of bugs you need to fix after this Capcom. Specially that lightning elemental weapon that make frame drops"""
1;I don't like thirdperson games. However this game screamed screw that and shoved a good time down my throat. Now I have played it for 5 hours straight... in one sitting... right before work... now I haven't slept but it was worth it.Side note If you start and are not having fun try switching weapons and trying something. I started out with the duel sword and hated this game but switched to sword shield thingy and fell in love.
1;This game is so great tbh. There're a lot of new gameplay environment to use in the map that so creative. Sadly the connection problem is so annoying and turn a lot of players into negative reviews. But this game still a best hunting action game so far. Just hope they can fix this problem soon or else I will turn to negative one too XD
1;Amazing gameVery in depth and engaging combat with lots of variety.Interesting and challenging monsters unique in their own waysVery well designed armor setsBeautiful and interesting environmentsLoads of fun with friends.Cons very awful storySlow early and mid game
1;EDIT Updates have been coming and I've had a much better experience. Flipping to thumbs up.Only staying negative until the connection issues have been dealt with. I could deal with all the frame dips and technical issues but all that on top of constant disconnects and some very hidden game breaking bugs is just too much. Once these issues are fixed this will go to a thumbs up very fast.
1;this is a farming based game so if you don't like repeating things.. buy something else.The world is amazing full of living creatures and monsters whitch create a large credible ecosistem. The gameplay is very fun 14 types of weapon very different one from another. The story is very very thin but fun and full of epic moments.
1;Rough launch for several people in terms of connectivity issues.Major resource hog make my GPU burn up something fierce. Loading times are fast and the frame rate is steady at least?Mouse and Keyboard feels weird but witht the bowgun I LOVE mouse aiming. Recommend using controller.
1;It's a bit of a shame the servers are throwing a hissy fit right now and thunder element damage effects being bugged (if you suddenly feel your framerate dropping check if there's someone using thunder element weapons. the effect causes framedrops like mad it seems.). Most of the issues'll probably be resolved soon though and we'll be in for one hell of a hunt!
1;Game's pretty damn fun even if the controls take a bit getting used to. Looks lovely and unlocked FPS is nice. Only gripe is the connection issues gripping the game makes it a bit unreliable to play with friends.EDIT CONNECTION ISSUES ALMOST ENTIRELY FIXED. 1 DISCONNECT IN 3 DAYS.
1;I wanna be the very bestLike no one ever wasTo catch them is my real testTo slay them is my causeI will travel across the new worldSearching far and wideTeach monsters to understandThe power that's inside One of the best games. Great graphics Great Gameplay. 9.5/10May the sapphire star light our way
1;Finally a Monster Hunter game on PC! It's everything I wanted and more. Sure sometimes you may experience some connection issues but they're rarer than people would lead you to believe. It is frustrating when your friends are DC'd midway through the fight leaving you to fight a multiplayer scaled monster alone but the game is fun enough that I can ignore it's minor flaws. 8/10
1;Originally bought it for the PS4 and decided that it was worth it enough to buy again on PC to play with friends. Has some connection issues and some other small bugs that a few patches should be able to fix. Other than that still fun just needs a bit of love to solve some week one issues.
1;Optimization could be better for sure. Writing this at launch there are occosional problems with online connectivity as well. Everything else however is pretty great the changes the game brings to the series are welcome and finally having MH on pc is worth the rocky launch. i'm gonna stab some dinosaurs with my cat now
1;Vega 56 Performance!Great game great graphics smooth game play. Only 8hrs in but I can see this lasting several hundred. I have a vega 56 custom water cooled and overclocked and I am getting 70 80fps at 1440p all settings turned to max with the exception of volumetric fog (off) and one click down on shadows. Awesome performance no stuttering or frame dropping. I am also on a 2700X at 103 BCLK (with PBO and all that stuff)
1;They fixed already. able to play co op with my friend which is nice and only got disconnect once or twice a day sad but still great than before.......Before they fix.*It's single player game server down everyday. they should put only single player only. For who like to play co op i suggest you should go play other game that support online multiplayer than this one.*
1;As a veteran Monster Hunter player (since Freedom Unite) I can say that this entry is one of if not the best in the series. There is much more freedom than previous titles as well as no loading screens between the areas of the map. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to do either single player or co op. This game does have a learning curve but it is an amazing feeling taking down a monster that was giving you trouble.
1;Overall my experience with monster hunter world is realy enjoyable overall the critics were bad because of problems that affected the matchmaking system as it disconnected you from the session but this problem was fixed in the recent patch.If you like grind in games i totaly suggest world as its well thought mechanics and graphics make this experience far more enjoyable
1;The frequent disconnects from Online Sessions makes the multiplayer mode unplayable. Capcom doesn't seem to be doing anything about it so that basically kills the game for PC. Don't waste your money on this unless Capcom fixes it and you see verification that the problem is resolved.UPDATE While still not 100% fixed it's very close and is now playable in groups with infrequent disconnects. I can now recommend this game for PC gamers!
1;Seems most launch issues were fixed. Worth the buy if you like the series. If you are just getting into Monster Hunter this is the best game in the series to start with. Plenty of play styles and weapons to choose from monster and enviroments look amazing and each fight is fun though some can be a little frustrating. Be wary if you don't like grindy games though this series is full of grinding the same monsters over and over to get the pieces you need.
1;This game has been out for a month. I don't play that much. I only have 375 hours on it but its pretty good. some of the monsters look cute and I just want to cuddle them. Since the game came out I had some dreams about me playing this game. I like the game
1;200 hours in. The best Monster Hunter yet! Old school fans might not like some of the changes however I think they improved alot. For example no more paintballs to figure out where your monster flew off too! The world is also a single zone so there isn't loading from area 1 to area 2 etc. I also don't feel like you're fighting the controls in this.I wouldn't try this game without a controller. That is a must!
1;This is an amazing game. I played the PS4 version for 300+ hours and still am having a great time. The PC version leaves a little to be desired considering its extra development time but it is a minor complaint. I love the weapons the monsters are fun to fight and the gameplay loop supports a lot of replayability. When you watch the opening scene and experience the horror of the english dubbing and lip syncing don't worry eventually the Handler shuts up.
1;the game is great...but u will have hard time connecting for online play.... i would not recommend buying it atm untill they fix the conectivity issue. but do buy it if u enjoy playing the single player mode.edit conectivity issues are fixed.... but it's still day 1 gonna give it few more days to see if it's really fixed.
1;Highly fun very few problems so far with playing with friends. Not a perfect port but certainly playable/enjoyable! Mutiplayer in private session (only with friends and without extra people) has not had any disconnects like I have seen in other reviews.
1;Honestly i didn't experience many of the issues of week 1 2 that people were complaining about. I've sunk a pretty decent amount of time into this game and i still feel no where near finished with it. Was it worth $60 on release? Probably not since the overwhelming majority say there were bugs and glitches out the but right now I am running completely smooth. Take that for what it's worth.
1;When i first started playing this game I gave this game a positive review. Now after clocking in 90 hours I'm still giving it a positive review. Bottom line it's a solid game that's worth every cent. There are a lot of bugs but bugs can always be fixed when given some time. To me all that matters is if the game is fun. Because at the end of the day it is just a game. If you're on the fence don't listen to these crybabies just get the game. It's worth it
1;MHW is a refreshingly original game from monster hunter series with strong human element it makes the player really feel like batman and the difficulty of the game can be viewed as the dark souls of monster hunter series too bad it has too much water 10/10 just like cupheadPS i hear the multiplayer is f*cked up but i'm a solo player so that really doesn't bother me
1;Good game. Good graphic. Newbie friendly. An interactive environment and gameplay. Capcom really wants to widen their demographic player. Started from MH ps2 MHFU and now this.Plus Newbie friendly. Story mode.Negative Nargacuga. Miss that buddy.For you who still has connectivity issue. Advice from MHFU.Git Gud in an offline mode while Capcom patching the game. Just give them time.See you soon in the next 200 hours.
1;I7 4790 and geforce 1060.Game runs perfectly and no crashes or connection issues so far. Now talking about the gameplay its perfect. im loving the heavy bowgun so far and the changes to both bowguns.The introduction of the interconnected map is awesome you no longer have to wait to load between areas and the result is a monster hunter title more dinamic.
1;it's a shame the multiplayer component is not working correctly. constant disconnects makes me think that capcom does not give a damn.UPDATE 08/23/18 they've actually done something about the connection problems it's not perfect but at least it's a step to the right direction. very hopeful about the state of the game.
1;You know what? Screw connection and graphical issue just buy the game and start slaying bunch of big dragon. Wear their skin use their bone and horn to make weapon. Swing your towering sword like kids on sugar rush. What could go wrong? And finger crossed you wont be kicked by random mid quest connection lost.
1;This game is fantastic if you have some friends. Right now there are some annoying network issues but hopefully they get fixed soon. One of the best games I've played in some time highly recommended if you have buddies. Probably still alright alone but the team makes it so much better.
1;It's cool after all it's a Monster Hunter series.Nonetheless prepare yourself for the ultimate loneliness experience.Join a session hunt with 4 players disconnected hunt alone for 4 players portion.Multiplayer experience is extremely bad.UPDATE the connection problem is rarely happening now.Hop in and enjoy the ultimate game of the year experience!
1;Very fun and challenging fights. One day you wafflestomp the monsters the next they are making you cry home to mama. Teamwork is important but the fun thing is to try the different weapons the game becomes fresh and you can play different roles. Very easy to get into and out of so you don't have to stay committed if you have IRL things to do. Best to play with friends and SOS for help. Yes there are bad players out there but you'll also meet good ones. Go have fun now!
1;Amazing achievement on the part of Capcom never has a MH title felt so fully realized to the original vision then World a really great achievement. But the performance issues and multiplayer connectivity issues make this review a temporary No. Keep your eye on Capcom and when this mess is over with pick it up.Edit It looks like the online connectivity issues have been fixed hanged my negative review to a positive
1;Aside of the connection error the game is really fun to play. Amazing combat systems playstyles and features. Adding some of the monsters from the previous MH is a nice touch to the game. 9.5/10 for the game 5/10 for the multiplayer servers. (Hope Capcom will fix it as soon as possible)
1;"""It's your classic Monster Hunter Games with a lot of quality of life improvement and the graphics is gorgeous.If you are new to the series this can be your first jump into the series.You hunt monsters and their family craft weapon repeat until you became the monster itself 11/10.*notes """"The game is too hard"""" is a bs try it for yourself they probably never played any action games."""
1;Pretty nice transaction. I know many people are complaining about the connection and many weird bugs but as far as I know these are more correlated with Steam its new UI rather than game itself. For most of time I have no problem with connection.But most importantly this PC version is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING with the control. I am personally not used to PS4 controller and the PC version hunting is much much smoothier.
1;Can actaully have a pet cat in this (im allergic to cats).... and its not a massive ! and also get to kill big monster guess thats fun aswell.... nah its awesome!! im playing it on high settings at 4k with 60fps most of the time. i7 4790k 16gb ram and 1080ti.
1;IF you are looking for a great action RPG this is a must buy. Just like all RPGs there are lots of grinding involved but the repeatable quests in MHW is just enjoyable. Everytime you hunt there is a chance to improve. The online game play of joining others frequent DC if you tab and not being able to watch cut scenes as a party when playing through the campaign sucks. That being said still a GREAT game to play solo or with friends.
1;I have about 400+ hours on this game its a fckn awesome game dont get me wrong but it kinda feels like it gets more repetitive and i feel like there s nothing more to farm. (I have 4 attack jewels lmao and most of the jewels i need for my sets i mainly use GS Lance and Gunlance) . hope we get more events like console does but until then i think im gonna stop playing for a bit. Hello car mechanic simulator 2018.......
1;One of the best RPG game on Steam. Brings me back when I played Monster Hunter on PSP. Monster Hunter as a series is one of my favorite games of all time. I hope you guys can look ever the trouble of the release of MHW. The connection problem will be fixed in the future. Happy Hunting fellow Hunters!
1;They finally released a patch that fixed some of the issues that were present such as the stuttering in the recess and the stuttering against Teostra. Now that the developers have shown that they care about this port and the endgame is playable I can recommend this game because the gameplay I awesome and the port is now good.
1;It's a good game where you tickle lizards. You might have to do some research to get it running swell on your machine but it's fun to tickle lizards and you should try it. Can't think of a better value for your money. More lizards coming in the future. It's finally here boys. Our prayers have been answered.
1;When I bought it I knew we were gonna have issues with the online It's the first MH on PC!. I love the game I held on buying it on PS4 and I think it was worthy. They'll be fixing the online implementations so this community grows and extends this amazing game even farther.The game itself has pretty good upgrades on gameplay and has an approach to new comers with the quality life modifications.
1;as a long time fan I can say that while the game is perhaps too streamlined compared to previous iterations. It's a fantastic experience with a new sense of freedom in playstyle movement and progression.10/10 will continue to slap wyverns with sharp pointy things for days to come.
1;Excellent port from the console version (being a controller user) and with the super fast loading times with a decent PC makes this so much faster and easier to go out and hunt all the monsters into extinction! Updates (both content wise and settings wise) will only make this better more accessible and more enjoyable.
1;i played all the mh since the first one for ps2... and this last one is amazing .. cant wait for the new monsters come out .. and i hope they bring the swimming monsters to this version along with new maps .. my favorite monster is the lagiacrus i hope i can fight him in mhw soon
1;+Here's a solid GOTY contender with awesome gameplay beautiful graphics and wonderful soundtracks. Probably hundreds of hours of fun content and enjoyment. Oh hey that sounds pretty cool.+It also has some connectivity issues. Piece of game go die Crapcom how dare you treat your fanbase like this fix your game.60% of reviewers probably...
1;Great game I just wished it had more of the old bizzare humor.Yeah the handler is more or less personified glutony but I have so many fond memories of the Guild Sweetheart messing up nearly everything she says or does or the Guildmarms loving personality and her monster fetish (remember her love letter for Brachydios?) this representation is very tame in comparison.But at least it has Monster Hunter Language as voice language and it has Poochie now easier to pet then ever!
1;I recommend this game regardless it is really fun.Steam this next message is for you.What you gonna do about my 200+hours of play that was quite literally deleted yesterday after i updated steam?Currently very ing mad and going through story AGAIN after i had finally hit HR49 to fight Tempered Kirin.
1;Amazing game. Connection issues and some optimazation issues aside I'm having a great time. It's all I play anymore and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. When they fix the current issues the game will be one of the best I've ever played and for sure one of the best multiplayer games on PC. Great job Capcom!
1;Definitely scratches a certain itch the core loop of hunting monsters to craft better gear to hunt more difficult monsters will keep you quite busy.The way the multiplayer co op is implemented is a bit shoddy sadly having to have watched a cinematic to play a story mission together and occasional connection issues.Recommended for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of grind and constant 'boss' battles.
1;Is this a Half life reference!? The char NEVER talks... so whats the pointon selecting a voice in the creation panel? just for random moans when you fight?can't skip cutsene... srly some cinematics are just for you to start in front of the monster...It's rly good but there are some annoying issues with the game.
1;Been playing it since it came out and I still find it fun and enjoyable. Majority of the people complaining are about not being able to play online which isnt hard to figure out if you search it up. sure the cutscene thing is annoying for online story multiplayer but other than that its simple to figure out. i do wish it was more open world and would have been nice to see players walking around in astera.
1;Hitbox is somehow broken from time to time. but anything else this game is pretty much RNG. Hunting the same monster over and over again and kill off their generation *cough* just to get what you want. At the end of the day this game is all about collection and have a blast with friends together either hunt some big or small monsters or do some really fun challenge created by friends. Oh last but not least Attack Jews is a myth btw. Happy Hunting.
1;i have tried rage games before. i have died a million times in darksouls but i never ever been so frustrated with anything more then the 9star arena quest. u cant counter build u cant choose ur items u cant choose ur wep. the diablos chain stun u and just spam borrow attacks wtf is this is this suppose to be fun at all? just being slapped around? this is just lazy endgame. nerf urself down to maximum and face the most annoying monster fight sense Tkirin.....
1;in terms of gameplay monster hunter world is a GREAT GAME but i would not reccomend spending money on this game at the moment because you cannot connect to multiplayer and many connection issues with the game i would wait. also experiencing a bug where you try to change applications and it sends you to a black screen forcing you to restart your computer. so i would wait until they fix these things.
1;Runs just fine for me despite all the bad reviews. Controler worked fine for me without any problems or setting up.Looks great and plays great. I wish multiplayer was better its harder to play with a friend than I like and some missions have to be started solo. Starting solo seems dumb when they let you call for help half way into the mission. running at 2k with a 1080
1;very fun game. port works fine for me and i havent had any problems with it crashing or stuttering. i have played every mission of this game so far with my two friends and have never had any problems connecting to each other. if you have a good pc i see no reason not to get this game.
1;Played the PS4 version really realy hyped for the PC version the port itself was acceptable for me but it is unplayable with friends since you can't even connect to a lobby. If you are lucky and able to get into one and even started the quest don't bother as you will lose connection 5 mins into the quest. A negative review until they fix the connection They fixed everything great game.
1;lower requirements can play this game and online dc and frame drop sometime but no problem.480p low borderless fullscreen volumetric rendering off / 22 30 fps720p low borderless fullscreen volumetric rendering off / 9 18 fpsi3 2100ram 6gbgt730 2gbwin 10 64bit
1;Negative reviews is just outrage because of the current issues with the game. People saying not to play and calling it garbage but I see 150k players in game right now just saying.This is the first PC monster hunter game I'm not surprised that there are issues espcially since it's a port. If the issues NEVER get fixed its one thing but there hasn't been enough time to made that verdict yet.
1;Despite the constant disconnection this is a gigantic leap graphically speaking from their console counterparts (I had 550 hours on the PS4 for this game upon writing this review)...they DO need to fix their server issues which understandably this is their launch and hence I will wait patiently for it.If you are a big dark souls fan this is a game for you D
1;I will change this review into blue after someone gives me a working tweak which disables mouse acceleration motion blur and depth of field.Edit They fixed it to an acceptable degree. Took them only 2 months. I stopped playing 3 weeks ago because i have nothing to do anymore and waiting for content. So here you get your beloved blue.
1;Tee El Dee arr Adun I like fighting the monsters!Just quickly pasting up a positive review since Steam is mad at a good game.Fighting the monsters is deliberate You can't button mash in this one. You need to watch the monsters and figure out what they're going to do and from which direction you should approach them when you attack. Don't get mad and mash the buttons!
1;The Game Is Very Good And Well Made And It Passed My Expectation Gameplay Is Great Weapons Are Cool And Armor Looking Awesome But The Only Problem Is The Multiplayer Session And Its Connectivity Issue Pls Fix It. The Session Keep Losing Connectivity Out of the random . Hope It Will Be Resolved Soon
1;"""Monster Hunter World without the ROCKET POWERED GREATSWORD """"Oh hey! I just killed/captured a monster in 15 20 minutes! I feel great!""""Monster Hunter World with the ROCKET POWERED GREATSWORD """"HOLY F*** WHAT IS THIS DAMAGE!? QUEST CLEARED HR 999"""" *Drowning in rare decorations and gems*oh yeah and it a pretty good game btw."""
1;The game is not without its flaws but they've gradually been getting addressed and the feeling you get when you finally down that monster after trying so hard is just so satisfying. There's tons of customization and every weapon has a distinct feel that lets you play exactly how you want. Every monster feels like a boss and challenges your skill in unique ways and heavily your rewards those who can push their skills to the ceiling.
1;Everything is Fixed The game is a Blast with friends they made all sort of changes from the older gamesPros Everything is just amazing Animations Graphics Maps etc lots of Quality of life changes no more Combo books!Cons its stupid easy compared to the Previous Games300ish Hours got 12 sets more than 30 weaponsMHFU or MHP3RD 400 hours 3 sets 5 weapons so yea the game is way WAY shorter
1;It's a game that's all about fighting single powerful enemies. And sometimes watching them kill each other which is even more fun. Combat rewards tactical thinking with a wide variety of playstyles provideed by different weapons and each weapon has different tools for different situations each of which is crucial to success.
1;"""Never before has getting beatten down relentlessly by two wyvern at the same time felt so good. If the thought of """"Oh i really need to go to the bathroom right now but I think i can fit one more hunt in"""" EVER comes across your mind while playing this I strongly suggest that you do not follow through with that thought. love this game."""
1;People are mad that the update schedule isn't as fast as they want. I'm happy to say that the game is worth it. Plenty of content and all additional monsters armor and weapons are FREE updates. Only paid items are cosmetics and emotes. Plus this is the first Monster Hunter on the PC so things aren't going to go as smooth as they would like. You can't just port over without effot. People just don't like to wait and have nothing better to do than post a negative review.
1;400+ hours with 300+ HR and theres still a lot to learn from using different weapons on different monsters with different builds. It's the little things that will keep you keep coming back otherwise it's just speedrunning and the waiting game for new content to arrive.
1;I have changed this review from negative to positive after the connectivity patches MONSTER HUNTER WORLD is marketed as a multi player co op game but in reality it was a single player game for a couple of weeks after launch. The game's connection issues have been patched and it's now fully playable online.
1;An higly addictive game plagued at first by permanent errors regarding network.Things seem resolved but it's quite a disgrace to see that happened.It's my first MH game and i have good times with it. Progression is quite slow but the game give the envy to push even more.MP is quite fun too but beware with your stuffs on expert monsters can be ultra lethal if you are not prepared for it.Right now I recommend this game with no problem at all.
1;Now has a good build. Very playable. My quad core processor and 4gig GPU are a slight generation behind and still runs at a nearly solid 60 frames. Don't worry about the mixed reviews they are old reviews by people who's moms won't buy them a better pc.Great game for people who like gear farming and having sweet boss fights all the time.
1;They dont call me Levi Ackerman for no reason with dual blades.Gameplay is nice I haven't experience any crashes at all.Able to play with friends just fine.One downside I have with this game is joining the friend if they are ahead or behind a cutscene which makes no sense.
1;The game reminds me of Warframe by the fact that you have to go on missions to get the parts/material for new weapons. But it also reminds me a bit of Darksouls because they have a similar combat concept. Overall it's a really enjoyable game and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good game that resembles either of the games mentioned above but also to anyone that is up to trying a new game.
1;Great game. Only slight annoyance is the story missions revolve around telling your friend to wait till the cut scene is over before letting them join don't quite get why they couldn't go the route of forcing all players to watch it/skip it but it will only plague the first few hours of the game and even then it is not as big a deal as everyone makes it out to be. Once the cut scene is over you can hop right in with them.
1;Don't let the naysayers discourage you game is fine atm and not hard at all compare to previous titles of the series. Always prepare for the hunts and you'll be fine. It still needs some performance fixes tho (CPU usage is way too high).Overall one of the best games of 2018.9/10.
1;MONSTER HUNTER WORLD 285hrs casual playerGame is all about grinding (farming materials for weapons/armors or consumables). Can be played solo or coop with 3other friends. enjoyable either way.cant wait for new updates to add in the other monsters.also hoping for new fresh monsters and locales to make game more interesting and refreshed.
1;9/10 because it's too Demanding for Ressources with that kinda unstatisfying graphics. Gameplay is great Story is whatever. Muted &amp went afk/minimized the Game in pretty much all cutscenes. Awkward voice actors in german. Also they lock content / bugfixes and bring them over time ...shady move.
1;I'm one of the few people yes they exist who got lucky enough to not have many technical issues theres a few rare fram drops but thats it. I hate to see this games reviews getting tanked so hard due to such a problem and I think it deserves way better. From my personal experience 11/10 bananas please goty right here
1;Now that the server issue is mostly fixed this game is a masterpiece. Whether you're a Monster Hunter veteran like me or new to the series this game is without a doubt worth every cent. I'm residually a bit sad that the issues were there but it's well supported dev's seem to mostly listen to community feedback one example being the mouse camera changes and it's an incredibly fun experience. Put your money on this game if you somehow haven't already.
1;Finally what we've all been waiting for a REAL Monster Hunter game on PC!Solo play is fun and challenging and the multi player is chaotic and a hell of a great time!Heck if after 150+ hours of play the game is still fun that's a good sign in my book. Not to mention several updates keep adding new quests and more monsters to slay.
1;Decent port online is a bit broken right now. Works most of the time (for me anyways) but other than that easily worth a buy. Very fun game.Update as of November 27th 2018 Game runs way better now than it did on launch pretty much no more fps drops. Online hasn't had a single hiccup in the past 14 hours I've played (started playing again a week ago). Only thing that's still a minus is the fact that we're behind on content compared to console.
1;Don't listen to the nay sayers about this game. It's honestly extremely fun to explore and fight larger than life monsters. Sure some people have connection problems but thats part of online gaming. The unique weapons are extrme fun and the graphics are beautiful. I'm really glad to see monster hunter taking steps to move into the next gen and stop looking and playing like a ps2 game.
1;Fantastic game but the decision to drip feed players with new content that is around for a limited amount of time outside has been puzzling. Previous MH games released the event quests and you got to keep them. This time around the inconsistently available endgame with the lack of G rank really has me disappointed. Do not get me wrong this is the best MH title mechanically speaking however from a content point of view there hasn't been so few monsters in an MH title in quite some time.
1;The main goal of the game is to fight the same monsters over and over again to learn more about them so that you can more easily defeat them (while also using their drops to improve your loadout). If you're not into that JRPG grind probably not the game for you. Much easier online / with friends. I enjoyed the game much more than I expected to!
1;Hunt monster get parts make gear repeat. Not for everyone but if you are a fan of previous games the quality of life upgrades are amazing. That and the constant updates like any Monster Hunter game make for an experience that is well worth the investment.
1;This port was done excellantly while the networking was off to a rocky start when first released it has since been much better plus the constant stream of updates and content of monsters and equipment makes this a really well done and enjoyable MH game for new players and veterans
1;This game is the most addictive game I have played in years. Dragon's Dogma esque combat with unique area and monster designs. I've enjoyed playing the game solo coop with friends and coop with randoms. I'm told the fun is in learning all the weapons but I'm quite happy just being a hammer bro. I can definitely see myself playing this game for years to come and possibly following the franchise closely from now on.
1;Probably should not buy this unless you have a lot of experience with Monster Hunter games or friends who do. This game needs more than a few patches.There is an addictive and amazing gameplay loop in here somewhere though.Edit The big issues have almost all been fixed. This game is absolutely amazing and addicting. The depth of the gameplay is basically unparalelled. Can't wait for the sequel and for more content.
1;"""If you come from other harder and grindier monster hunters you'll definetly dislike this one it's like a """"casual version"""" of the real deal.That being said it's still really cool and a good time with friends. The game really makes it hard for you to multiplayer the out of it... but it's been one of the best multiplayers of the year for me and my group of friends. Just make sure to use the equipment appropiate to their level."""
1;I have already put almost 130 hours into the game and I'm still not technically finished the story portion of the game. I have been enjoying every minute of the game so far. I am new to the MH franchise but I am definitly a fan now. From having access to all the weapons at the start to learning how to properly counter a monster it has been a wild ride. I'm looking forward to the other events that come out for this game!
1;Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game to play by yourself or with friends! There's a whole variety of weapons that cater do many different playstyles and whole menagerie of beautiful and well designed monsters to hunt! The team really did a fantastic job researching zoology and ecology in general the monsters really feel like they're animals with unique behaviors and not just some creatures standing around waiting to get pummeled by the players.
1;Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game to date! The gameplay and world are immersive and fun. I love the Monster Hunter series and have played it since PSP era.The texture settings are still broken and are worse than the Xbox One X version. Please FixOn an SSD a quest loads in 3 seconds. Coming from a PS4 where the loading times took literal minutes sometimes this is amazing.
1;Well you probably heard people praise this game for like a thousands of time nowbut i'd say it deserves all of it the combat is amazing but i play on a toaster so i couldn't talk much about the graphicalso the amount of free contentI recommend you to try it out and Iceborne expansion is dropping in 2019 too
1;Absolutely excellent game (as a Monster Hunter newbie always eyeing the portable consoles and their easy access with envy) whose technical issues at launch have pretty much been fixed. Lots to do fantastic gamefeel (tm) community largely not populated with pillocks.'s good.
1;as a long time monster huinter fan I will say that this is a good game but it reminds me a little bit too much of the wii game in that there are not all that many monsters to fight or equipment to craft relative to the ultimate/unite version of games but that will most likely be fixed if they make an ultimate style expansion
1;A fantastic game with great depth and love poured into it. The PC control scheme is a bit rough but you get used to it (or can change it) very easily. Solid gameplay stunning visuals. High skill ceiling and very good community to answer questions and provide tips/assistance.
1;Fun game. Most fun to be had for me is with other players. Hunting big bad monsters is fun and there are enough weapons to keep you busy! Slowly catching up with content released on consoles already so no worries on that front. Can see myself playing for quite a bit more.
1;Pros Amazing environmentAmazing soundFluid controlsQuickly catching up to console eventsConnection has improved a lot since releaseCons Feels a bit easy after a some timeNeeds more monsters (especially non wyvern monsters)Weapon design seems lazy for a lot of weaponsAll in all it's still a really good game especially since my last MH was MHP3rd. 9/10 would watch my friends get yeeted across the screen again because they misread a monster attack
1;i love this game to the core of just how fun it is to play with a group of friends and smack the hell out of a big dino and then make cool amour out of the dino you just killed and repeat it but each can have different outcomes due to different playstyles or just the enviroment change or even with different bigger dinos getting in the way but i heavily enjoyed this game.
1;Great game not perfect however the grind is fun until is not game is dependent on new beats to maintain the fun of the grind at least on my opinion since you can learn each beast pretty quick and once you learn the patterns it becames more mechanic and therefore less fun.Apart from that the game is solid really fun and a great variety of weapons and armor.
1;I really love this game only thing i don't like about it is that it takes a lot of my CPU and Memory. other than that it's a solid game that i would recommend for people who likes to whack a car sized hedgehog lizard or a scaly kitty that hates everything with a burning passion.
1;Good game good fight monsters do have some cute reaction and movement fine storyline don't mind the character detail there are always mods you could use connection issues are resolved if you love some good grinding and fine combat game go ahead and buy it!
1;I love how the battles feels rewarding for with each battle I get to know more of the weapon dan monster. Not everything is obvious so looking at outside sources for tutorials and insight really helps to find new ways of fighting keeping the game feel fresh.
1;Live out your life in being a hunter! This game will let you challenge yourself in many aspects such as analyzing the monsters building gears and such. It is a very hard game but with your friends and with the community you can reach greater heights. You can still solo but it is more fun and helpful to join other hunters in the quest of being a great monster hunter.
1;Been playing Monster Hunter since the first one came out on PS2 and while I certainly don't speak for everyone I've enjoyed the heck out of it. I have no issues with endless crashes or bugs like everyone seems to complain about but that's just me. A good way to kill time and enjoy the game for what it is the next step up in the series. Hoping to see more like this and more for consoles like Playstation Xbox and PC.
1;Great to play solo or with a group of friends. Lots of monsters to hunt and the different weapons each give a different approach to hunting. Many quality of life improvements over past installments make it easier for new players to get into the game but don't detract from the experience for veteran hunters. Bug fixes and new content has been steadily improving the overall experience of an already great game.
1;I don't know if I've ever been as excited for a port of a game from consoles to PC as I was waiting for this game. Monster Hunter World hit every expectation I had coming from previous monster hunter games while also bringing forward great quality of life changes and ideas. I preordered this game with my friends and it was the greatest two to three month binge I've experienced in a long time I love this game and it is very well worth the price and Capcom has pulled through for us once again.
1;One of the most fun games I have ever played. I played this game for over 200 hours on playstation and bought it again a few months after It was out on PC and its still just as fun a 2nd time around.The frame rate and graphics going from the normal ps4 version to this is well worth it.
1;Great monster hunter experience the conectivity issues that it had after the launch have been fixed for the most part.Great game with a ton of content if you are looking for a monster hunter experience this is a great enhancement of the original formula.
1;I bought this game on release and WOW did it surprise me and still surprises me today. They just keep on adding more and more content back to back. Very fun to play solo and even more fun with friends. I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes to spend a lot of time playing a game and collect everything that is possible to collect!
1;A lot of Variety with 14 different weapons great visuals nice music different monsters challenging yet fun fights/mechanics and the updates seem to be frequent. It is fun with other people but it is not impossible to solo I recommend at least 2 player coop so you can get 2 players and 2 pets (palicoes) in fights.
1;Capcom's first MonterHunter game on PC this game game is really fun there is a lot to learn in the game I m still learning and evolving as a hunter and would highly recommended this game to anyone especially those who appreciate action RPGs with good build diversity plenty of customisation and depth.
1;After years of waiting i can finaly play MH with my friends on PC. Well... we have a legal way at last.Yes this game is a bit different... few simplifications are made to make this game more friendly for a newcomers. But still it's MH game. And God i love MH.
1;This is a good game. I have not played any previous monster hunter games but that didn't matter in this one. The game is well put togather and altho a short story is still lots of Fun!Very few bugs mostly just conection issues (which have be improved alot)I would give the game a recomendation to play if you like killing things.
1;Until they Fix their servers and multi player sessions im gonna down vote this. yes you can play solo ok but when in multi player sessions? slim chance for completing a quest with the team. also they should put up a reconnect option.They have fixed the issue eversince the 2019 kulve taroth started the disconnection issues came back again.
1;Monster Hunter isn't for everyone.But for players that have played previous titles of the same game.This is a must try. Because compared to the previous titles that makes you tear your hair during high level hunts Monster Hunter World can let you solo every Monster without any frustrations. (Take note the hunt is not taking candy from a baby but not as hard as generations)
1;One of the best game in the monster hunter series. Personally im a monster hunter veteran played the game since it came out on psp. I would say mhw is some what simple to understand and they made the game quite friendly towards new players. I would say mhw is one of the easiest one to play of all the mh series.
1;As a long time fan of the Monster Hunter franchise I was thrilled with Monster Hunter World a game that managed to improve the recipe of its addictively fun predessecors while remaining more accessible to franchise newcomers. The satisfying pattern of hunt craft graduates from handheld systems with honors in this gorgeous big game safari RPG.
1;Be the meowster hunter this world deserves...1. Track the monster down2. Fight the monnster3. Kill or capture the monster for its parts5. Repeat6. ????7. ProfitBeyblade beyblade let it rip! (If ur trying to play with friends good luck not getting disconnected tho happens often)
1;This is the most amazing game of the year! (For me at least!) And thus I have followed this series since PS2 titles came out! I'm glad CAPCOM decided to try something new now! Keep moving forward CAPCOM!I highly recommended to those who are new to play this game with your friends! It is fantastic game that you won't regret at all!
1;Monster Hunter World sets out to simulate a living and breathing ecosystem and absolutely nails it. Monster Hunter hasn't felt this fresh since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and it does that by not only returning to it's hunting roots but also expanding that concept in a way the fans of the series never thought possible. This game marks a turning of the tide in the series and it will only get better from here.
1;Honestly one of the better games I've played in the past 5 years. Really really good gameplay. Good grind if you're into that. No grind if you don't want to play big boi endgame. It's for everyone to be honest.Has some issues on PC but imo none that keep the game from being worth it's money.
1;Simple pros and cons.Pros Modding community is available and active. Beautiful graphic. Can be further improved with reshade. Free DLC. I have fun slaying monsters. I enjoy watching people cart. I enjoy watching my friends cart.Cons Capcom gave a non answer statement on modding. Cheaters??( I have never encountered one yet.) RNG heavy. If the idea of killing the same monster 100 times is not your definition of fun I suggest you find another game.
