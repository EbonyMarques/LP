0;Had a ton of fun with this game for awhile until they released Freddy. Freddy isnt only game shatteringly broken he completely drains all the fun out of the game absolutely refuse to play any survivor until they actually do something about Freddy. Instead of pretending the slight tweaks they did as a 'nerf'. After weeks they still refuse to fix him. Would NOT recommend in it's current state.
0;At first i liked the game a lot but recent DLC's just take away the fun. Overpowered killers and a toxic community Bugs and Hosts with always 250+ Ping make the game 'exhausting'. 9 months ago i would've upvote it.. But the way it is right now rather not. Grab it if it's in sale because i think the standard pricing for the game itself &amp DLCs is way too high. GIve it a try and make yourself a picture of it.
0;Dead by Daylight aka Dead by T.w.a.t.s is a r.e.t.a.r.d.e.d game made by potato brains. It's full of kids and incompetent devs that instead of fixing their 'made by paint.exe' game bugs they ban you for them. There is an ocean of bugs like texture ones map bugs design bugs and a long etc.... but nah it's better to let the players 'swim' in those and instead of fixing them the devs penetrate their dirty d.i.c.k.s in your a.s.s.
0;GARBAGE. TRASH. POORLY CODED GAME. CRASHS AS MUCH AS IT RUNS. DEV'S PUSH OUT NEW DLC (PAY TO WIN) KILLERS BEFORE BALLANCE OLD ONES IN AN ATTEMPT TO MILK THE 'USEFUL IDIOTS' OF THER $$$. YOU ARE BETTER OFF HUFFING PAINT THAN PLAYING THIS PIECE OF TRASH. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A NICE IDEA BUT IT IS FAILED GARBAGE AND THE ONLY PEOPLE CALLING IT GOOD ARE JUST TRYING TO JUSTIFY THEIR TIME AND $$$ SPENT ON IT.
0;Great game HOWEVER do NOT spend money on killers. You will only be able to play about 2 games as a killer as you will constantly receive a 'No network connection' error every single time. If you want to play survivor it will work 100%. Playing as survivor every single time gets repetitive and draws me away from the game.
0;Its the worst thing you can imagine since its a 'fun' game to play with ur friends yet in a few hours in the game you can lose everything u grind for it . Not only talking from me but lots of persons lots their data because of the game it self so i don't recommend buying this game not only for the data but for the bugs the killers are the server etc etc . for a game that have more then 1 year its pretty bad
0;A lot of bugs i do not recommend buying it cause the developers make it worse and worse by every update. I tought to myself i will ignore the bugs and stuff but this game is WAYYYYY more terrible by every update comming . If you consider playing it with a mate be ready to wait for 3 years .
0;All the developers had to do before 1.0.4 is to fix remaining bugs. Not only some of them haven't been fixed yet but within the newest update the gameplay has been ruined and the only cool thing about the recent update is new outfit but that's it. Totally imbalanced and not worth playing anymore.In the current state I don't recommend this game to anyone. Uninstalling and rating negative.
0;Day 1 and a lot of server bugs. Give it time to see if they fix the lobbies and dropped connections (right now getting a game going is terrible) and add in some quality of life improvements like muting the lobby music and I might change my review. Until then meh.EDIT Almost a year later. Logged in to see what has changed. Lobbies still suck. Survivors still trolling killers until they DC. Lobby music still annoying AF. Uninstalled. Guess I'll give it another year.
0;Dodgey and crap security is terrible loads of campers i report but dont get banned. That includes swearing farming and other abuses load of those idiotic people do. My word to anyone who wants to buy this garbage it is a waste of money. The devs should lower the price and highten the security because i have loads of people abusing me so i report them but dont get banned. The flippin vids aren't even game footage.
0;Don't recomment to buy full prince. This game is buggy 30% of time when I join lobby I stuck on loading screen. Event Thingies become useless after event ends and wasted bloodpoints what you can't ignore or go way around them.Unbalanced matchmaking. Lazy devs are lazy.
0;Dont buy. Not even for little money. This game is the most toxic game every created and in addition got a highly toxic community. Avoid this game by all means !!! On top of this the devs are idiots and ruined a good game idea. The game is annoying and unsatisfying as the killer and as survivor
0;Dont waste your money on this trash game. The creaters are stupid because they removed infinites and nerfed survivors. But the funny part is they still have not removed iron grasp or nerfed it and they still have not nerfed the killer so this game should be better because the killer is to overpowered
0;All the bugs disconnections and frozen menu screens really take you out of the game. Not what I expect when I pay for a game... If it doesn't do what it's supposed to then it shouldn't be released. Please fix the broken game that we all payed for. Thanks! Update 1 year later... Can't even play the game... always crashes with no fixes available... thanks alot for the wasted money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!
0;Game would be great if developers give right rules in game. Killers can use unsports behaviour to win which we survivors cannot counter. Campers and tunellers in game more than 70% of games were played with toxic killers. If developers still let killers play like this this game will be trash. For now i don't recommend this game to anyone.
0;Good game the developers are fucking stupid. They give us DLCS instead of fixing game breaking bugs that cost many players such as myself to get completely reset back to level 0... ON EVER FUCKING CHARACTER. People grind countless hours on this game and the fact that you can get reset at any moment is bullshit. Would not recommend buying until the devs fix their sh*tty game...
0;Except when you get in a game where its laggy as hell and u just jump around while running. You get stuck on walls when you tried to turn and end up dying..... fix that and there will be a better review have a way to vote out for the lag on the game... so stupid i lost ranks cus of that
0;I think the game loses much of its value when it stops being scary. At about 10 hrs of gameplay you can see the flaws come out. While there is nothing with this type of gameplay out there on the market I feel like the game is a long way from its potential. Bugs glitches salt toxic community if you like this game you're not looking at the comment section.
0;Above average design but persistent bugs and a sadistic toxic community have destroyed this game. As decent players have moved on to other games the community has only continued to get worse. This stays in my library in case friends want to play with me but I will never pay another dime for content.
0;Absolutely hate this game the game mechanics sucks the devs are stupid and WHY THE HELL IS CAMPING A TACTIC?! the killers are all to tryhards the teams are sometimes i would rather play Friday the 13th than playing this crap. If i would recommend this game atleast they can do is make the ga e FAIR enough. But sadly i'm going to give it a not recommended game. Don't waste your money on this game.
0;At this stage I cannot recommend this game.DEVs are moving extremely slow. Either they are one of the following incompetent lazy or just not caring. It's been a year now since the release and they did almost nothing except empty promises. So many bugs still not fixed...
0;Awful game still full of bugs... Got to the end of the round and i froze right infront of the open gate and my character froze. I couldnt move and as the moster put me on the hook and i died but it kept me in the game. I had to leave the match and got none of the points i got for turning on mnost of the generators and opening up a gate. These guys arent fixing these horrific bugs SO DONT BUY WASTE OF $20.
0;Creators of this game are stupid es. THEY CANT IN BAN PLAYERS WHO CAMPS. WORST COMMUNITY EVER. WORST BALLANCE EVER.WORST REALIZATION. BAGS. LAGS. STUPID CAMPING S. STUPID BAN SYSTEM IT NEVER WORKS. OK YOU SAAY THAT THESE PROBLEMS ONLY ON LOW RANKS? NO! ABSOLUTELY IN NO! THESE PROBLEMS ARE ON ALL RANKS!I HAD 8TH RANK AND I KNOW.SO I DONT WANNA BEAT AROUND TE BUSH THAT IS WHY I CAN SAY FINAL VERDICT THIS GAME IS T AND THIS GAME FOR STUPID USELESS CREATURES
0;Day 1 and a lot of server bugs. Give it time to see if they fix the lobbies and dropped connections (right now getting a game going is terrible) and add in some quality of life improvements like muting the lobby music and I might change my review. Until then meh.EDIT Almost a year later. Logged in to see what has changed. Lobbies still suck. Survivors still trolling killers until they DC. Lobby music still annoying AF. Uninstalled. Guess I'll give it another year.
0;Definition of pay to win. Multiple Killers that are locked behind DLC and multiple survivors locked behind DLC. Locking gameplay behind a pay wall is pay to win. Oh also the game is an unbalanced joke and has been since day 1 The idiots making this game don't deserve your money lol
0;Probably the worst game I have ever played. Its fun at first but once you get use to the controls you realize the game is jsut 110% luck that's all it is. Anyone who says different is delusional. Community is garbage like most it's full of obnoxious cretins who'll just spam the chat with insults.
0;Servers are laggy especially when in Competitive. Not to mention the fail competitive system. When someone leaves in the first 10 seconds (or even later) the game is not cancelled or you don't get a bot to help out. If you like frustration this is the game you want.
0;After so much time spent in this game i can say for sure.Don't play this gameYou can be the best player you can do everything right you can just follow the basics your team will crush your hopes and dreams when you try to achieve something cool.And they allow semi pros and lower ranks to join ranked games ing absurd
0;I dont understand this game. Everyone plays 10 placements and get down bottom to prospect 1. So why have placements when you start from bottom anyway?I just hate that i must now wait couple weeks to get nice balanced matches. Its not even funny to have newbies and legends in same match!Its in the sale you can buy it now but dont waste your time on now. Do something funnier for couple weeks...
0;There is absoluitely shocking amounts of server lag if you are thinking of buying this game do not... at least until they sort it out.My ping is 26 (easily low enough) and my car slides all over the place with the disconnect symbol appearing. TL DR DO NOT BUY until they sort the servers out.
0;This game is cancer. Servers are so poorly maintained it made my mother divorce my father and made my dad kill himself. The auto ban system made Donald Trump win the Presidency. This game gives loser bubbles to all the kids giving them Bull hits like Bernie Sanders giving away free I get no bubble and my car misses the ball and the boost by 1mm and i slit my wrists a little deeper. This game is why ISIS hates America. DONT PLAY THIS GAME. Me 0/10 
0;Matchmaking is terrible. You regularly get 20ms ping players paired with 200 800ms players while the game is unplayable above 100ms ping. This happens in competitive 1v1 as well.I don't recommend this game.Update since season 4 matchmaking is super slow. Expect 5 minutes between games instead of 30 seconds.Update ... and a rank reset again. Every season (say every 2 months) you have to earn your rank again and end up terribly matched for about 50 games.
0;This game is so bad i could get 60 autistic kids and make a better game/server better yet 60 blind autistic kids and make this game great again! Trump needs to fix the servers before i take my life. On the verge of killing of myself also un installed 44 ping but game keeps skipping not my graphics card or anything.
0;ing gambling worst game ever created it requieres so much precision that you will loose always at least 7 of your 10 games played a day or 3 of 5 games a day.the 1 vs 1 is even worse as the only factor that mades you win is Luck doesnt matter how good you are at this game.This game has very poor physics. Making you loose most of your games.
0;I played this game about 200h and i realised that my life is worst than it was. i should be rising star or higher but everywhere is a hacker in every in' game. just dont buy it. EVERYWHERE HACKERS AND IN' KIDS. Not recommended at all. 'Rage League' 19.99$
0;As a player from Western Australia the lag makes it really frustrating to play at higher levels. The slight lag is enough to make you miss an occasional shot and this is a pretty big f*king deal when you are playing with other really skilled players. NEED SERVERS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA!!
0;Fuck this Game. In 2 days playing i get like 1 time Wasteland Map and 2 times Tokio Map. So when they handle that like this my thumbs down will stay .Edit Thanks developer for ruin the game by listening to the kiddie community and thank your for the last update every second game laggs.
0;Please stop with all the DLC you are ruining the game. At least include the new stuff if you have to make new cars... its annoying to have to pay to have all types of paints and .. i mean come on i paid 20 ing dollars for this small car soccer game at least give me what i ing paid for... i hate dlc...
0;literally the worst game I've ever played. Let me edit this real quick. Literal ing garbage. No way to add friends no remediation for ranked game leaves quite possibly the worst ing match system available... it is punitive and broken. Unplayable mess of complete and utter t. Do not buy. DO NOT BUY
0;Game is the shitest pile of crap with full on V neck sweaty cucks who have dorito's sitting on their router and can't even bend over to reach their toes. People that sweat out and get pit stains in this game make me sick. The best bit is when you intentionally get blown up by the crappy s who would be better off ended KYS SMH.
0;I hate this game with a passion on the top ten things I have wasted money on in my life this is on that list right below a lottery ticket. Its not the graphics or anything about the game except the human element within this game sucks. If I could get a refund I would delete this hot mess out of my life.
0;This has to be one of the worst games I have ever played. Ever hit a ball so hard it moves backwards? Now you can. In this game the physics are fucked. The driving and car styles are absolutley horendous. There like some kind of Tonka toy a kid would play with. Save yourself $20 and go buy an 8th of weed and enjoy life without this so called 'game'.
0;this stupid ing game.. it was HARD ENOUGH TO RANK UP WHEN IT WAS BY POINTS BUT NOW YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO GOING UP IN A DIVISION AND EVERY TIME YOU'RE IN DIVISON ING FIVE YOU CAN WIN 6 GAMES AND NOT GO UP A DIVISION AND THEN LOSE ONE ING GAME AND GO BACK DOWN. 
0;Worst game I've ever played hands down. You looking for teamates? You've come to the right game. Because every game you play we promise to hook you up with Abdul from India who get 300+ ping and a kid name yourmom69 who is absolute dog at the game. I've been stuck in gold for about two months because my teamates game after game drag me down ranks. The only reasonable gamemode is 1v1 because you cant get teamates you get opponents. Fix the ranking system and fix the players.
0;crap game so fustrating nothing drops played 12 hours since update no crates wat a load of crap wen they do its players chioce great pay to get gud stuff like usual makes the game no fun well done. mate has played it for about 3 hours today an got 3 new crates yeah great system and matchmaking still crap cant play unranked as 75% of games get cancelled wasting your time pointless.
0;Most of my hours are idled I haven't ever really played this game. So I'm doing the tutorial today playing as killer on the third or fourth tutorial bug where I'm stuck in a tree and can't move. Can't restart keyboard working fine I have to exit the tutorial now I must start from the beginning yeah bye uninstalled.Also there are barely any graphical options and the stupid game is capped at 60fps? I have a 144hz screen that's useless to me. Why the hell is this stupid game so popular?
0;One step forward and two steps back. Game was working great for a while now it seems like I cannot join a game without one or two people disconnecting. I've been kicked from a few games myself before the match starts. Needs work on connection stability or at a minimum if someone gets kicked off the game should adjust the number of generators required to escape. Come on devs you're better than this.
0;Play this game with four friends if you want to play lobby simulator. We never find a game with for people. We either have to be in a twos or a threes. This is a great game and fantastic concept behind it. However when you can't play with three of your other friends it's irritating. I do not recommend this game to anyone.
0; This is the stupidest ing game I've ever played in my life. The matchmaking system is wack and the hitboxes on everything are broken. Good survivors against noob killers and good killers against noob survivors. How does that make ANY ing sense? Don't buy this game.
0;Ranked games are unplayable people keep ragequitting without being punished. MM is broken. Peer to peer connection so if the host is downloading porn you basically can't play. With all the money they got from selling this game they should do more then something about these problems i'm disappointed.You can have a lot of fun with friends that's the only way you can enjoy the game.Looks like this game is still in beta but the major problem is the community totally sucks.
0;THIS IS NOT A REAL RELEASE BUT MORE LIKE AN ALPHA VERSION! If you wanna buy some alpha and to become a beta tester you are welcome. Otherwise stay away from this game. It crashes lags throws you out of lobby out of game etc. You lose your inventory items your points. It's simply completely unplayable.I REALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PIECE OF GAME!
0;Terrible game can't find lobbies more of a bug than a game no point in playing as a killer because survivors are overpowered and the servers are utter trash i usually have to play with around 200 ms which is not good compared to other games i get around 25ms in
0;Terrible game! When you exit the game there is a chance of simply just losing rank! Community games are a nightmare! Russian players as usual will start to insult you in the chat Russian words some players start to squat once dumped a pallet! Just a disgusting game... That why i hate this game
0;Terrilbe game. I played survivor got rank 10 play 5 games was back and fourth. then 5 games in a row got camped then after I started tilting i took a break I played another game and took 10 minutes to find a game that was 3v1 and got cammped the whole game again. I took another break and tried one more time and play a FREAKING 1v1 !!! THAT IS THE DUMMBEST EVER! you guys could fix this game so easily man ! but you guys are lazy and dont want to fix it! that
0;The Devs are completely out of touch with how to balance their game. Negative review based on what was said on the stream as well as based on the nerfs they keep throwing to killers while unnecessarily buffing survivors.The game should be hard for survivors. Not comfortable. Get your heads out of your asses.
0;This game is a piece of lagging and unbalanced game I don't recommend buying it because 90% lagging (to the point where it's literally unplayable because of the killer) matchmaking (rank 20's with rank 1's or matching you with someone from Korea when you live in Central Europe the classic ) )
0;This game is a steaming pile of should have done more research on it before spending the money for it. The devs are a ing joke the forum is run by ing idiots and the game is so toxic you get cancer and die the moment you double click it to start the mother er...Don't buy this piece of it will only bring you pain with devs that don't give a about you and forum mods that act like children... The game is craptastic
0;This game is full of funcking idiot camper killer and egoist survivors.But an easy way to win this sht game you need just to download as killer and the survivors get laags and leave easy win.If you find some people mid on day and not mid on night . shit game shit people with no skill and to much friends
0;When i play as a killer.it usually shows me that 5 survivors are in the game then my game crash. what the hell is this?I sent the report bug like 10 times and it still crash after many minor patch.When do you really gonna fix this? It really me off.I have lost many pips due to this kinda of crash.
0;YOUR GAME IS ING 1HRS I CAN PLAY JUST ING ONE GAME GO DOING WHY YOU DON'T ING FIX YOUR ING IDIOT SERVER ZONE WELL CAN YOU GET MY ING MONEY BACK ? YOUR GAME IS ING PIECE OF I'M SO DONE THIS ING GAME PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR? ING IDIOT ALOT OF WORDS GO FIX IT AND GIVE BACK MY ING 19.99$ ING DUMBASS
0;dear god.......the queues for this game are absolutely horendous....this is no exaggeration.....i'll try to play as a killer and sit waiting for a group for over 5 minutes........ if i want to play as a survivor though i get a group in 3......... the queue times really need worked on or the player base expanded right now because the queues are so long its not even worth playing.
0;listen this is a great game so fun i really well reccomed it but the only problem is it crashes all the time for me and its always mid game so i would definetily make sure ur computer is very well beacuse if not u can taek the risk i took and lag and crash
0;this is a so much cancer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and i have tumors that i can feel on my back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!they are not creators of good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i uninstall this because 1.the killer is ing invisibile 2.the event is bugged!!!!!!!!!this is not okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!it doesn t deserve twenty euros!
0;Why are lobbies always full of a million players making it IMPOSSIBLE to do ceo and bunker stuff along with lobbies with modders and hackers. Loading also takes A FUCKING WHILE.There should at least be a way to fix thisBut no its RockStar so they dont give any about us but our money.
0;This game is terrible the community of players is pretty bad the hacks are WAY out of control. Even if it is in its pre alpha it appears the dev team has little idea of what they want it to be. This being said if they tune it up nicely and figure out where the game is supposed to be going its grafically acceptable while being a terrible FPS. save your money for now and possibly forever.
0;the anti cheat is so bad that almost all server got aim hack and wall hack (see through walls)i played recently on HONGKONG HAPIS 1 and there are no admins online all the rad town is secured by walls just yesterday got raided by hackers he shot me before i even peeked through the window so......pls improve the anti cheat. the current one sucks
0;This game need 100000 Ram ... and with my good pc i have fps drops ... lags and more ... +1 year in early acces ... not bad game but this lags and fps frops bugs douing this game sometime unplayable... wait on release now i dont recommand you this game (and i play 700+ hours)
0;Honestly this game got worse by the years. Have had it since the beginning of New Rust after legacy. But this game is wierd it's clunky and Facepunch keeps adding stuff we don't need in this kind of game. They added a node minigame that was not liked by the community and now they added Tree minigames it's getting worse and worse. BUT it's not a bad game it just could get better.
0;This is the worst game I have ever played! I would rather have my balls ripped out while getting my eyes gorged. It doesn't matter anyway because by the time you finish playing this game your balls will have exploded (if you are a girl you will grow balls... then they will explode) and your eyes will have melted out of your face. And don't worry it doesn't hurt this game is so bad that your body turns so numb you can't feel a thing. UNINSTALLING!
0;Addictive in a bad way and has a community comparibly as bad as counter strike.I get it's a survival game.I get it's supposed to be hard.But what I don't get is how you can expect someone to be in ANY way when there are no incentives to being an abolsute .
0;Just dont buy this game there is a million way to spend your money to have fun rust isnt one of them.I cant play with my friends the game is too badly optimized for them (with 770gtx 8gb i5 3+).The fact that the game is in alpha stage since 2 years should tell you to run away from this game listen to your instinct and do it.
0;I actually generally think this game is in my top 5 least likes games thats not threw anger or salt it just seems like the developers just dont know what there doing. I do NOT recommend this game but if your up for a horrilbe experince be my guest but over my 3 000 hours most of my memorys are bad one. I dont like saying it but it is best to speak the truth.
0;i miss legacy i bought it when shortly after it came out. dont get me wrong i kinda like the new rust and all it has become but i really loved the basic concept of legacy. legacy offered a less competitive aspect which made it alot more fun for me and my friend to find new people and make new friendships. sadly those days are gone and the creators destroyed the rust i loved so i must give this game a bad review. i am sorry for this but i simply cannot recomend this game that claims to be rust.
0;Do not buy. Very incompetent team. I found the game to be pretty much a scam as there isn't much to do. Raiding has become nearly impossible and you can make a full reinforced base fairly quickly. Yet it is impossible to raid. Team keeps releasing bad updates and game has been out for a while and isn't optimized. Updates that do come out are bad and ruin raiding. Pretty much a non optimized form of COD now that you can't raid with tons of lag. Game is a scam. Do not buy.
0;verall very bad PVP either does not exist or you just can survive more than 5 minWithout a squad it's just not worth itPVE almost not existingWeapon mechanics bad Building mechanics actually  imagination is the limitUpdate 1 12 2018Can't join any server.Devs have no solutions.Just deal with it.ATTENTION DO NOT BUY THIS GAME
0;Very bad game and very bad community. I'm going to unninstall this game after I write this review. Then I will kill myself and burn my computer and haunt the annoying people who keep r*ping me in this game. They don't have a life when they have 9198935902867496757q785q709278670297602786429687q908760q79867398678937967827896789768957680929562 hours on this game and they hack or are just fucking pro players and maybe they should think of getting a job or a life.
0;This game is literally becoming trash! Ive just played 6 games with hackers all in a row.... ive been on for about 35 minutes. How the hell do expect to play a game when youre getting shot through walls from a guy driving shot gun in a car across the map?
0;This game is actually a complete pile of garbage. Too many hackers and the game is so choppy and laggy that it becomes virtually unplayable for the first two three minutes because everyone is from everywhere in the world and there is a massive desync issue that is still somehow in effect. This game needs to be sold to a company that will actually better it and not one that is just going to rake in the money without making any actual improvements. Bluehole is a terrible terrible company.
0;The game is getting worse by the day.Rubberband lagsBullets not registering properly (e.g getting shot even though you're behind a wall)Poor match making system (queue for team/duo get yourself and no one else)Extremely poor chances to get any decent costumes
0;It feels that with every update they make for this game it gets worse and worse. It would be nice if the F*ckhead devs would do something to optimize this trash. It's a good game with good potential but it keeps getting ruined with every update that comes out.
0;The game is unoptimized but fun. The reason why I can't recommend this game is because 50 players in every game cant speak english (mainly bad for squads/duos) and have 1500 ping giving them an unfair advantage. It isn't racism it's practicality. MAKE BETTER CHINESE SERVERS and put them all there so we don't have to lose to people who are essentially cheating/exploiting.
0;Do you like garbage game servers? Do you like trash graphics with computer melting gpu and cpu usage? Do you like glitches random deaths by freaked out vehicles and bad physics? Well then this is a game for you. This game is 'esport ready' after all.
0;This game is extremely poorly optimized and server desync causes very strange problems. For instance while firing backwards on the back of a bike I somehow murdered my driver. Cool feature.This game will be fantastic once it is optimized further. The sheer amount of money that players have thrown at it vs the state of the game is ridiculous.
0;Battle Royale is a great genre but if you're considering this don't.This game is still broken. I don't get when people saying the game is dead when there's still more than a player playing the game. But still not defending this trash. From what I see this should be a free game so it can compete with fortnite.
0;after spending a bit of time attempting to play this game my conclusion is region locking is needed badly hacking is a every game occurance and server stability or lack of it needs addressing promply . i love the idea of this game but cannot stand its flaws esports ready as claimed it is not get to work blue hole . you have less time than you think .
0;this game is so ing trash. i paid ing 30 pounds for this ing stupid game. the hit mechanics are so wank. the gunplay is you die in t ways i just dont liek this game no more. blueballs made so much money yet cant even optimise the game. the game runs like trash. stupid bugs stupid glitches 2/10. FORTNITE IS BETTER SO THIS TRASH REALSITIC GAY ASSS GAME. I CANT W8 FOR THE SAVAAGE MAP
0;Played this game for a few hours now. The movement controls are absolute garbage. You have to play on poor control settings Everything is glitchy indicators and sound bugs make it impossible to know where you are getting shot at Asains are at the gameAlso early access they proably won't improve this game.This game will be forgotten like h1z1
0;Absolutely awful game. They haven't even attempted to fix the lag desync and cheaters. You'll get shot after you are 5 feet behind cover ran over by flying cars and get pulled back to the ground when you jump because of lag. DO NOT waste your money on this trash. Wait for something better!!!!!!!!!!!!
0;this game goin to be die soon. it's already a year and they receive so much income from this game. but they never fix this trash server trash optimization slow development now they being so greedy by disabling trading and make more paid loot boxesfor they who want to buy this game better stay away if you wont waste your money. they losing player day by day
0;Utter garbage and the owner CEO or whatever Brendan Greene is a terrible person who panders to the majority Chinese user base lag is terrbile even with a powerful computer and good ping also map design is UTTER TRASH.Would not recomend even if it became a cheap game. (would be a good f2p though)DONT BUY!
0;badly optimized laggy bad hitboxes bad terrain character posing (can't lay on the ground on some rocks)...bad coding. it takes more than 3 shots from assault rifle to down a person (didn't expect that kind of sheet from ArmA dev) BUT u can be killed with 1 shot jump punch in the head. + u can farm pointsUpdate 03.10.2018Omg this is still sooo laggy and unoptimized. No fun in getting freeze at the end of the game and crash...Why am I still playing this....yep boxes of course...
0;Becoming unplayable. Honestly the guns are trash and uncontrollable. all i can use are dmrs or snipers cause the guns are just terrible. this was the only game i used to play daily and it just got ruined. Honestly the game is basically dead to me. i would recommend anyone who wants to play a battle royale theres a few new ones that are gonna come out soon but this game is just ruined. between hackers and terrrible just terrible gun mechanics.
0;This game is so bad the character's does not even respond to the mechanical keyboard when you for example strafe left there is a slight delay before your character starts moving this does not happen in the battle royale Ring of Elysium.The delay ruins the game 100% you should fix the delay before you even release such a .
0;This game is a total non sense. Assaulted NA servers by Asian and Chinese players bad ping bad hit detection non registering shots and hackers who know's exactly where your at...don't waste your money on this. On 10 games in a row I coudnt find a speakin english partner...what a joke
0;still glitchy still desync (altho a bit better still very bad) there are alot more cheater now and when you play vs chinese players they teleport around..... i have high hopes low expectations would not buy again untill fixed also when you are sitting behind a hill or in tall grass if a player is more then a couple hundred meters away they can see you even if you cant see them because of the poor distance rendering.
0;the ing lag is so bad it takes 5 min befor you can take 1 step and there is no chanse to pick up a gun. ( and no its not my connection its the ing servers) and its not because of loading at the beginning eather sometimes im fine at first than the lag comes but sometimes its after iv ben it the game for 10 15 min. fix your servers plz
0;This game has very very bad latency issues. Behind wall no problem just shoot the wall. Houses don't spawn.... ok developers ban you for their own faults. Game is unplayable in any servers you will get 250 million chinese hackers that pubg doesn't do anything about.
0;I want so badly to play this game but between the server lag and MASSIVE amounts of cheaters it is nearly impossible. If you are reading this review I dont want you to think that there is a tollerable amount of cheaters because that is NOT the case. There is indeed AN UNORTHADOX AMOUNT OF CHEATERS!!!!!!!!!
0;I deleted this game ages ago from my library I saw updates and was thinking I would give it another shot. but WOW the game is even worse then before 0 improvement on the hit reg 0 effort from this trash developer team. Oh we need to focus on putting out new maps guns and dumb things like grips. It is just falling even further down the trash can.
0;Developers are completely incompetent.You make a couple of $100 million and you still can't do the basics of a video game. These devs do not give a sh!t. The list of unbelievable backward decisions and terrible broken updates is endless by this point.The game has not been improved it is just being haphazardly patched together with chewing gum.It has reached the point now where I would rather play Fortnite. I don't like Fortnite.
1;As a killer you have so much fun. You get the chainsaw (wow!) and you also get a beautiful bell which I might add scares the crap out of my guy friends who are meant to be 'brave'. As a survivor the game's atmosphere is absolutely fabulous! I haven't played such a thrill game in such a long time that actually gets my heart racing let alone actually making me jump. I would also recommend this game to everybody who loves a thriller and just wants to release some tention as a killer )
1;Beautiful game I've always wanted something like this and I have been waiting for Friday the 13th game but this will do for now I do wish it had a little more open world sometimes it does feel cramped and or a better way to communicate with your fellow survivors 'unless you have teamspeak' but overall I really enjoyed this game I played the crap out of it during the beta launch
1;Great game for under $20.00 but there are still a few bugs. Main issue is that there is no option to play with mixed parties.Unless you have 5 people playing in a custom game there's no way to party up with just 1 or 2 friends and search for a game. Your only option is to do a 'Quick Play' at the same time as your friend and hope to get in the same game. Adding a game Lobby before searching for a game would easily fix this.
1;So I've played 20+ hours of this mostly as the Survivor and I love it! You'll see a few negative reviews because there's no 'Survive With Friends' feature yet but it is coming. As far as the gameplay it's very tense and unpredictable. Also there's no in game chat between survivors. You never know if the survivors you're paired with will help you or leave you to die. I'm having a blast with this. I highly recommend this game! It's amazing now and it will only get better!
1;This game is actually pretty good. I like it quite a lot (not including the games I get camped) 700+ hours and I can play and enjoy it like if I just bought it. 8/10. Would recommend. Below is my favorite quote from one of the devs.' I think we've done a pretty good job so far' Mathieu Cote
1;Very good game if you are interested in 'horror' survival games this is for you. Matchmaking sometimes sucks but it is pleasure to play some games and have fun. I am playing this game also on Xbox so I couldn t forget to buy it on PC )I recommend this game. BOi
1;What an awesome game!! I was lucky enough to try it for free. I was so impressed by the game that I bought it immediately afterwards! Being a fan of the horror genre I love being able to stalk and kill 'helpless' victims. Don't even get me started about hanging them up on hooks. It appears that there is no shortage of DLC content too so the game should stay fresh for a while!
1;10/10 Got chased by a invisible dude who would ring a bell everytime he saw me... Then I steeped on a beartrap got rescued and healed myself by puting a bandage on my arm... After that a random guy chased me with a kitchen knife... And to finish it all i got hanged on a hook.Would play again
1;Absolutely amazing game. It still has its bugs and balance issues but that is to be expected from such a relatively new game. I can't wait to see the new features they plan on adding and watching this game take shape.Overall the feel of being in a horror film was perfectly captured! I would rate this game a solid 10/10 for its fun gameplay and great potential. It has worked its way into my favorites list.
1;Alright I love this game and i wont lie... This is my favorite game on steam and it has ever sence i bought it. I say you should buy this. I mean i havnt got bored of it yet and ive been playing for about a year now. Like suriously I love this game so much I still dont know how this game doesnt have more players. It really should have more players also thank the people who made this really really fun game. I think they made a great job of this game.
1;An amazing game. Especially when everyone is all in. The best is when you're paired up with a truly terrifying killer. Most of the time there is little to no lag. But occasionally there are issues. It is also friendly to a wide range of computers. I can run it on a relatively slow computer and I have friends who can run it on even slower systems.
1;At first I found this game to be really repetitive and thought I was going to regret my purchase. After a while however I realized that this game kept getting me to come back to it as the matches are addicting. There are several different killers and maps making each scenario slightly different. Depending on the skill of the other players the game can be very challenging or easy. Anyways it s a lot of fun!
1;Can you imagine as awsome as it would be if we could see other player's expressions on the coner of the screen while playing as the killer!? The look one one's face as you chase down one player and the closer you get the more intense things get. Although it could probably serve as a distraction... I give this game a 9 out 10! Excellent game with big potential for more.
1;Dead By Daylight can be extremely fun and challenging. The idea of the game is a good idea and hopefully the devs can improve the game further.I recommend this game because it can at times become addicting to play. If you ignore the stupid glitches and bugs it is really enjoyable. However with friends it's a even more enjoyable. )
1;Dead by Daylight has always been my favourite game to play there's always constant updates on the game to improve the game. For example the revamp of the blood web to have have lesser nodes and the choice within 2 perks instead of one. Really helpful update! The idea for survivors to have infinite health when being hooked the first time to encourage killer not to camp you is also a really good idea. I love Dead by Daylight hahaha
1;Dead by Daylight is an honestly great idea and a game it emphaisizes teamwork and the thing about matchmaking is that the surivors are woefully overpowered in later levels hence why no one plays killer and usually camps as killer. But that's besides the point I personally love playing killer against randos it's quite fun being called a camper when all i do is rotate. 10/10 would hook again.
1;Dead by daylight is an interesting game with a unique playstyle. I have invested a couple of hours into this game so far and have enjoyed my experience both as a survivor and as a killer. However that said If you are looking to play this game with your friends then expect to be waiting awhile whilst the solo match making queue seems to work flawlessly queuing with friends does not and can really ruin the experience if you want to play with friends.
1;Dead by daylight will make your heart beat and you will feel the tension when sneaking around or getting chased by a raving psycopath! A must have for everyone who like horror! Plus you can play it with your friends. You can get hooked together and get camped but that's just another story...
1;Fun game in general not as buggy as it used to be and chasing around survivors is something I can easily do for hours. Game feels pretty complete with the dlc out have only encountered one major bug since the patch and that's in about 10 hours of play. A game well worth playing especially if you have 3 4 friends to survive with or hunt down.
1;Good asymmetrical survival horror game that provides tensity while maintaining a sense of purpose for survivors. It suffers from a hefty dose of grind fatigue however as it takes hundreds of hours to create a good perk build for both survivors and killers.As a whole i would rate the game a 7/10 as of now.
1;Good game better if you play with friends for communication. The only problem is that me and my friends sometimes search a lobby for a long time before we can start a game and then we have a camper killer... But overall it's fun enough to make me recommend it
1;Great game especially now since you can Match up with friends. The game still has a few bugs to work out but the DEV are excellent at responding to the community. They listen to the users and continue to update the game to make it more polished. Highly recommend!
1;Hello there!I really like playing it! DBD is much fun and its best playing with friends. Im getting super annoyed by all the bugs and unbalanced Killer Survior Perks (My opinion). If u wanna have all DLC's it costs a lot of money but they aren necessary so thats fine with me.
1;Honestly I won't lie this game does have some problems that need to be worked on like matchmaking some bugs etc. But I def would recommend this game to anyone. If you play with friends it makes the game so much funner. I love the whole idea of the game and the concept.
1;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME CAUSE THERE ARE SOME KILLERS WILL FOLLOW YOU NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IN WHICH YOU'LL GO LOOPING EACH OTHER Who said this game is a horror game but MEHHHH Lieesssss ahhahahaha xDDDI never laugh so hard cause of this game I LOVE IT &lt 3333
1;Hello everyone i have a question. i resently upgraded my computer and i love playing this game but have not been able to play this game eversense i can run anyonther game no problem but this one will not run over 15fps i have a radion rx 560 and it utilises 100% of my gpu for some reason is there anything that i can do to make this game work because i have the right sestyem requirements to run it but somthings wrong and i realy want to play the game again
1;I would recommend this game specially if you get it on sale. The game itself is fairly simple and easy to understand but hard to master. It pitches 4 survivors against 1 killer in a randomly picked map. Survivors try to escape and the killer does what a killer does. Pros Ability to outplay other people is fun and encouraging.Many hours of play for relative little moneyUpdated regularly.Cons Lack of a proper Ranking systemSlightly lacking polish on non gamebreaking issues.
1;The start of the game can be a bit challenging for new players and progression is pretty slow until you've put a decent chunk of time into the game. Lag is pretty common and can ruin games. Players with a lot of time invested can be pretty toxic.Even with these problems it's still a fun game. The learning curve is steep but once you've gotten the hang of it it's a lot of fun.Playing with friends highly recommended especially for newer people
1;The game is good but after 100 hours of play you understand that in it as in any other community game is not so ordinary (toxic). Comterative is not interesting as they usually all go to the discord and break the gameplay for this they are camped and then in the chat we see complaints about maniacs. But the game takes the atmosphere and I hope that the game will be engaged in the right direction
1;A really fun game that requires a lot of teamwork.Obviously a lot more fun to play with your friends but also great to play by yourself to try and get better at the game.Some things need more work though like the lobbies being P2P and you being dependant on the internet connection of the killer. Also the anti cheat system needs some more.Great game to play try and get it while on sale
1;Has had it's ups and downs for me but when you starting playing absolutely EVERY noise scares you and it's a really cool experience even more so with friends! You get to introduce people to the game and let them be the scared ones and you can all laugh and have a great time. Even when you've played for a long time you will still get the jump scares and that rush when you're being chased. I love it
1;Hide and go seek + freeze tag. Most of the community are good people. It's difficult to understand how to win when you first start. Keep playing until you get the hang of it. Great to play with friends.Edit Still one of the most enjoyable games I own (as of Nov 2018). The team is constantly making this game better. Totally enjoy it
1;It may be never bug free but the devs are always working on them. Its the best horror game currently available and features some well known characters from horror movies. The community is mostly nice and often fun. Totally worth its money. I has some great events too which make me wanna come back to this game again and again
1;This game may induce the saltiest of people to become so full of rage that they take it out on innocents may have made me so mad that I HAVE to get off a game but I cannot deny the hard work the Devs put in. They face so much crap from the very community that both praise and despise the game try their hardest to get things right and appease the community it's hard not to love them. The game itself always has enough draw to keep me coming back especially when friends are playing
1;i love this game. in most horror games it's singleplayer and even when there is multiplayer in a horror game it's mostly only coop and the killer is just an AI but in this game you can be the killer or the survivor if ur survivor someone else is the killer so you have to play against real people i would really recomend this game if you like horror games it definetly is worth the money(or you buy it on a sale like i did
1;This game is addictive. With headphones you become fully immersed for a night of jump scares. The game provides you with a variety of surviors and killers which makes every game different from the last. The developers are always adding items charatcters and mechanics to keep the game fresh. Payed full price and don't regret it at all
1;Best Horor multiplayer game I ever play. It is better than Friday the 13 . I want to see jason in dead by daylight is for me very powerful killer and I want to fix the Freedy Krugger. You must buy this game because is so fun to play with friends. Rate 10/10
1;I've just transfered to pc from ps4 (been playing since 2017 on the ps4) the free week made me do it. PC is much more smoother an overall better experience. And I even grabbed the deal which includes Dead by Daylight &amp The Saw DLC! For just 12 a great deal! This game is great would recommend! One of the few games that make me stick around
1;A very Fun horror experience for both the Killer and Survivor. For Killer it's the fun and Thrill of the Hunt that makes them fun. For the Survivor it's the Resilience and the will to survive that makes playing them fun. it really is a fun experience
1;I am completely hooked. Get it? Its not without balance issues occasional bugs and salty survivors. However its a blast to play and very rewarding for the time I have put in. I love this game
1;I absolutely love this game!!!! From dying on the hooks to hunting your prey down and hanging them up to dry Dead by Daylight has a great atmosphere thaat has intense moments that make your blood rush!!! Worth every penny I paid even the DLC's are nice even though you have to pay extra you do not need them to play and enjoy this wonderful experience.
1;I highly recommend playing this game to any sci fi thriller or horror game/movie addict. AFAIK it's the best Co Op horror game on Steam and it's worth every penny. It's still in it's early phases of development and considering that it's freakin' amazing. THUMBS UP!
1;I highly recommend this game for those who want to play a third party game with friends and want to have fun by running from the killer and repairing generators.That tension when you're the last and you only have one door open and the killer is camping it it's amazing.It's worth the money only on sale though
1;I highly recommend this game it is a fast paced horror game and is worth what you pay for it. The only problem is with the characters I feel it would be an extremely immersive experience if you could create your own character andunfortunately thatis not an option. Otherwise it is an extremely good game I hope this review was helpful.
1;I love this game I have played it for almost 200 hours now and still get great fun out of each and every game. However if I were to change one thing about the game it would be to add more things to do in the game. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game
1;I love this game so much fauvorite game hands down. but every other week i come up against some sort of problem like daily i get the heartbeat problem. when i launch i also get 2 games and have to go to task manager and take off one of them. sometimes my anticheat is messed up. i feel they need to fix the problems but i really like the game
1;I really enjoy this game. I do wish they would add different maps instead of adding different things in the map. I expected more maps for the game before beta but it was the same map just with some extra new features in it. The game is solid. It gets your blood pumping and you actually feel that rush while playing the game. If you're into horror games or movies this game is for you. But again MORE MAPS! D
1;I recommend it highly. The developers are working on this game all the time trying to make it fair for killers and survivors. It is really fun D Things change all the time to keep the game fresh. New characters often. Keep up the good work devs. The people that whine are just pansies to be honest.
1;I am completely hooked. Get it? Its not without balance issues occasional bugs and salty survivors. However its a blast to play and very rewarding for the time I have put in. I love this game
1;This game is loads of fun to play. Both killer and survivor. As a survivor main I get plenty of thrills when getting chased. The game is even better with friends! If you want you can hop into a private match with friends and screw around. Or you could go into a game as survivors and play together. Overall if you're a thrill seeker like me or want a game to have fun with friends this is a great game to play.
1;Prepare your butt for the GREATEST SUFFERING that this world has known! Playing this astonishing game you will face an amazing community. You are welcomed in this residence of toxicity which contains lots of fun for every taste pallet looping gens rushing camping tunneling teammates getting you farmed AND MORE! bugs. These badasses are made to make you cry tears of blood. hours of your miserable life unnoticeably disappeared )10/10! This game literally makes me wet. Just play it!
1;It's built so you really do need to play together to win. It lets you play as survivor or killer or both. There are tactics to learn tricks to discover and it gets your adrenaline going. No internal chat/voice while playing helps and doesnt kill the ambiance with toxic douches. Better than expected and has quickly become one of my fav games
1;There are no words to describe this game. Well maybe a few Toxic Hillarious Chaotic and A blast to play with or without friends. High praises and I cannot believe how much the recent dlc's have been improving compared to some of the older ones.11/7 Highly Reccomend
1;After some initial doubts I have found this game to be quiet addicting. The game has a great atmosphere and never fails to give me adrenaline rushs while playing as survivor
1;I have loved this game since it came out and played countless hours and when I can't play I watch streamers on twitch.  this game is full of thrills and the devs are constantly updating it. The DLC's and new maps are fun and fresh. While some games I stop playing over time I always find myself back on DBD &lt 3
1;Worth every penny.This game is one of a kind. It has to million unlocks and the graphics are awesome.The gameplay is amazing the physics are on point and the whole game runs really well.Also there's no fandom that has infested this game.It's games like these that we need more of.
1;I owe this game a review really. Some of the most laughs I've had playing games were trying to learn rocket league and when you get good its still such a fun game. The high skill ceiling means you're always learning. New mechanics are still being found 3+ years after release which says it all.9.2/10
1;This game was awesome I played it so little at first I didn't find it fun but as I began playing the game and getting better at it I found that I couldn't stop playing because every time I would do something cool and I am now addicted to it because of that.
1;This game is awesome. If you are into a good time and want to play with friends then this game is for you.I have played since late 2015 but just bought it myself. I'll tell you it was worth it.The game is very fast paced and amazing even if you are losing.SOme people might not enjoy the mechanics on crates but trust me if you rack a few dollars up it is worth the money.Overall this game needs to be played ASAP. Fakii Really Moist Bread
1;This is the game that I think made me into an actual gamer. Definitely the most hours I have ever put into a game. It is addicting to play over and over again to get better every match. Definitely got my money's worth out this game. And I havent even explored the workshop update that they added but I bet itll add awesome custom modes and maps for a long time to come.
1;consistent and solid physics that are easy to understand but very hard to master make for the perfect competitive game. Also has cool car customization and is frequently updated.Chinese player beware. Psyonix has partnered with Tencent for the chinese release of this game.
1;Very addictive game 100% a good choice for the ones who wants a game to spend quality time and have fun. Actually when i bought the game i wasn't expecting such a great game but untill today when i hear the name Rocket League i fall in love like it was the first time i've played.
1;Absolutely fantastic game! It's a sports game that doesn't feel like a sports game when you are playing it. It's very addictive. There's a bit of a learning curve if you wish to get good at the game. Very fun to play against / with friends. Most certainly brings out the competitive side in me!
1;Happily playing a game of ranked doubles....Scoreboard 2 1 with 30 sec to go looking good gonna rank up this matchDisconnected symbol comes up Oh god why now????Error connection to server timed out rank down 13 points banned from matchmaking for 15 min..........8/8 would smash monitor again
1;The game is really good I can't say it is not.I have a lot of fun playing it but I feel like it is good to wait when the price of the game goes off a little bit.Because I wouldn't say it is worth of spending that much money on the game and if you are If you're planning to put money in the game there are boxes that you have to spend money for the keys
1;Really good game with a variety of skills needed! Very challenging in some sort of aspect with a fun feel to it. Community lacks a little bit do bump into some of them kids who think they're amazing but miss the ball 24/7 im diamond 3 to champ rotating between them ranks and i can say i still love this game! As you can see by my hours it took a while to get there so dont let your self down practice makes perfect! you're all thank you &lt 3
1;This game is absolutely awesome!. I love this game and it never gets old just like my other games.First i was like whaaaa??!! Then after some time i was really enjoying myself. Not only you can play online you can do many tricks and skills and do custom matches Much more too!
1;Rocket League is a awesome Game.The graphics are quite wonderful you can customize your car A LOT and every Game is different.It is of of those Games which are really easy to learn but really hard to master.Another awesome Thing about this Game is that you have a really recognizable Learning Curve and that you are proud of yourself each time you finally manage to do something that you trained hours and hours for.btw sorry for all kinds of grammar mistakes i'm german.
1;Definetly worth $12. Very fast paced game. There isn't a learning curve which is nice but it will take a while to get everything down. It's a very exciting game. I always go crazy when I make an insane save or crazy pass. If you want a fast paced competetive game this is it. BTW I play this by myself and its still extremely fun.
1;I really enjoy Rocket League. It is the perfect embodyment of easy to play hard to master. It is brilliant for having friends over and playing even if your friends aren't gamers however if you play for a while you can find yourself doing crazy aerial maneuvers and scoring insane goals. Definetely a good game to get!
1;I always tought what fun could it be to play a car footbal game over and over again well 150 hours later I can honestly say its fun! It's easy to play hard to master which makes it quite fun to play. It's really a challange to be really good at this game. Would reccomend.
1;This game is way too addicting for one's own good. Last night I played for 7 straight hours and 123.4 hours in 3 weeks. this is insane. I just say 'one more match' and it turns into three hours! it's insane! I have to turn down my video settings but it runs well and plays great
1;This game is amazing! All you have to do is put in some time. Dont expect to be good until atleast 50 hours played. Every single rank you progress in is a COMPLETELY. DIFFERENT. GAME. it gets more fun the higher you get! D would reccomend this to anyone of all ages )
1;I've bought this game out of curiosity with the humble bundle (about 1 month ago). I've been playing this game ever since. It is just awesome the developers give so much and even the stuff you can buy is reasonable. It makes a lot of fun especially with friends. And the cars are well balanced i don't feel like there is anything unfair in this game.10/10 best game bought in years.
1;Played this game for a long time. It's honestly really good. The new rocket pass allows players to get decryptors and open crates for basically playing the game.It's a really good game it's not pay to win because the best car is the Octane which you get for free.You can buy things to make your car look good. But it doesn't help in game.Overall really good game. You sometimes run into toxic people but you can toggle chat off. Yeah.Overall my favorite game.
1;Awesome game! This is by far one of the best games of the Century. I've played a lot of SP mode and recently started online but I can tell you that both are great. Love all the variable and exciting missions aswell as the free play on the huge map. I've got a PC with good graphics and CPU which makes the gameplay very smooth and real! 5 of 5 stars!
1;First and the best game I bought... have totally no regret buying this. I am suprised that rockstar still continue to update and add new content and mission modes into GTAV without haveing us to pay for them as 'DLC' just buy the game and u are good to go.
1;Singleplayer is realy cool.You can add awesome mods to it.Story is cool. Online kicks br&gt Fun to play with friends.Awesome online races.Missions with money rewards.Weapon unlocks.Becoming a VIP CEO and a MC President.Buying houses. Game is awesomeGraphics can be realy realy good.You need a good PC.+Worst PartIn Online there are modders.They can get your money and add to theirs.Steal your weapons and other stuff.There are less of them/*IMPORTANTDO NOT ING BE A MODDER IN ONLINEor I will kill ya
1;Its one of my favourite game i would definately recommend it. Advantage Great GraphicsFun to playDecent StoryGreat Charactersthe Overall its a good game
1;This game is probably my favorite game ever. The single player is a long well written and fun campaign with some awesome moments. The multiplayer while there are many hackers is also incredibly fun if you have friends to play with. The multiplayer heists are well designed and have immense replayability. My only complaint with the multiplayer is that many cars and outfits are fairly expensive. Overall I would rate this game a 9.5/10.
1;Product received for free. Its actually very good game. I mean it really does have good graphics but you actually dont need that good pc for it. Every single pc from 2015 2017 should run it smooth.I have only 13 Hours on it just beacouse my procesor. its very bad and i dont have much rambut i still can run it but i can hi min fps of 10.My PC GeForce GT 730 2 GBIntel Core 2 duos E75004 GB RAmI Recommend this game alot. + you can get very cheap on LINK REMOVED or Send me message for more
1;Ay sup guys its ya boii noone. So this game is really good recommend it a lot great graphics hostile players (well most of them..) but there are good ones wide selection of weapons masks clothing and heist we cant forget the good old hangar mc vip ceo and bunker bussines they make a lot of money so yea i recommend the game.BUT before i got Rockstar fix the damn servers they always kick players wat is wrong with u fix em for the LOVE OF GOD thx Buh Bye
1;One of the best selling games to date and rightly so. Had a bumpy start with playing online and then recently the whole issue with modding the game which both were resolved fairly quickly. Besides those issues it has been a really good experience having played it on the Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC was worth playing through it on all platforms. I can't fault it whatsoever
1;I mean... I bought this game twice so I guess that shows how good I think it is. Well if you're into a well developed story with memorable characters and a multiplayer open world game that has endless of content I would definitely recomend this game! However be prepared for some hackers pay to win players and a lot of waiting
1;It's really a good game to play at home. You can play with friends you get do mission races and more! You can even play it without WIFI! But you just cant play Online. But you will be occupied in Story Mode! Playing Online is the most fun. You even get to play Rockstar created missions!
1;Best game ) Got banned too 18.04 cause i hacked XD i just wanted some money.Plus Very fun its too much things too do ) Most of the players are nice and kind and EVERYONE love to show off their cars.Minus No mod support (. I still got FiveM which YOU should try out its the best online mod for GTAV today.Too many s online.8/10 Have a nice day )
1;Game's story is very good and most important part is online version is giving you fun and you can when you can play with your friend you can't get bored you can do lots of things in online version you can fly with planes drive a fantastc cars and you can be piece of action
1;Grand theft auto is one of the games that got me into gaming. Loved it since number 1 the story line in GTA 5 is ing awesome. You get to play as 3 different guys and that is all i will say i am not spoiling the story for you new players out there. After you beat the game or even before u beat it... or during u can get online and play with friends !!! D Hell yeah.. battle time heist time.. fun time )
1;Really amazing value for this game...PROS * Single player will have you hooked for a good few weeks untill you finish the main story* There is so much more to the game than the main story* The online is free and they release new content all the time!!!!!!! I have never been so happy with a gameCONS * If you want to buy online money for real money it is pretty expensiveCONCLUSION It is a crime not to buy this game when it is on sale for $20
1;Everything was perfect. Then one day Rockstar decided to add 'flying cars which are throwing rockets' to the game... WTF? Modders weren't enough i guess. But i still recommend it i mean its a fun game plus there is online mode and friends and Very nice!
1;is it a good game ? depends if u're gonna play it offline sure as hell but if u go online NO seriously there are lots of hacker and rockstar doesn't seem to care about it.is it worth the money ? Yes it's a GTA dude if those hackers are gone this will be a damned perfect game
1;single player is excellent the replay value is good and its pretty much the game of the generation probablythe multiplayer is slightly more aids due to the sheer number of people who are usually better than you and with you on a hourly basis the multiplayer is very very fun but also very very repetitive unless you are messing around with friends.good game also if you play theres a 90% chance you will become rich in the multiplayer mode cuz all the hackers make it rain money
1;Very good game. Single Player is fun complete and never boring now that we have MODS. Probably a good 10/10 from me.But on GTA Online it's kinda mixed. It's pretty boring if you're playing without friends around because you will most likely get bombed by some dude in a jet or get shot at by little in kurumas. But in the rare chance that you have friends everything will be fun from start until you run out of to do.Online just depends if you can handle playing solo or not.IT IS A RECOMMENDATIONBUY
1;I 100% recommend this game to anyone who is looking to spend a bit too much money on a game. If you can find atleast one other friend to play this with you will not regret your purchase. From ing with people in a jet or just doing ceo misssions and starting up a business. This game is not as fun if you're alone but don't worry there are alot of s in gta 5 online but i've met quite a few nice people.
1;One of the best games on console bought it on sale nice community better with friends (oh you dont have any) well thanks for saying that the loading screen is long so boot into singleplayer and then multiplayer and its faster this is an overall amazing game ( 5/29/2017) Hacker gave em 15 trillion dollars GG EZ
1;Amazing game bought this before release and downloaded before release. Played the game 2 minutes after release. Cant get enough of it there was a wave of hackers which me off but now R* started banning them so its good. Hopefully they get some sort of anti cheat like VAC or something that bans them instantly.
1;Definetly one of the best game from this deacade. The Single Player portion of this game is really good. Great story great character great environment all aspect of this game is just top notch quality. The Multiplayer portion of this game is also really addicting and fun. I definetly recommend this game for you to buy
1;Probably one of the best games I've played so far! The graphics are amazing! Sometimes I catch myself just driving/flying around Los Santos for hours. This game has an awesome story and such hilarious conversations I should also mention the music which is very good. Rockstar did and amazing job with the city traffic it's very realistic and so is peoples behaviour. If you enjoyed the previous GTA games you are gonna love this one!
1;GTA 5 an open world third/first person game. The PC version is a great improvement over the consoles you can finally play it in 1080p 60fps. Great. The story mode is good i'd suggest you play it the Online is much better it's the same Los Santos but with real players. Have fun
1;Awesome awesome awesome...oh and did I mention AWESOME!!! I can't only find one fault in this game that annoys me and that's the fact that there is a Casino and you can't use it. Hopefully a future DLC will address that issue but until then the game is just plain fun.
